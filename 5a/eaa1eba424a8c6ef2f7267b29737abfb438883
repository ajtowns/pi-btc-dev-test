Very good point.

Do you mean something like the below?

scriptPubKey:
  IF
    {A's pub} CHECKSIGVERIFY
  ELSE
    {curr_height + 100} CLTV {B's pub} CHECKSIGVERIFY

This ensures that Alice has to spend the output in the next 100 blocks or
risk it being taken from her (she just has to put an OP_TRUE on the end of
her scriptSig). So, it seems we can forget about an inverted CLTV/CSV,
great!

Best,
Stephen
