And another at:

http://test.webbtc.com/<http://test.webbtc.com/address/myTPjxggahXyAzuMcYp5JTkbybANyLsYBW>

Testnet does not currently fully function with for creating transactions:

http://test.webbtc.com/<http://test.webbtc.com/address/myTPjxggahXyAzuMcYp5JTkbybANyLsYBW>

Because there's no "unspent" API for getting the unspent values for an
address.  If there existed a testnet explorer which would send out those
values (as blockchain.info does with the main net), that would be awesome.

I'm also working on a testnet explorer with semantic web markup so that
it's both human and machine readable.
