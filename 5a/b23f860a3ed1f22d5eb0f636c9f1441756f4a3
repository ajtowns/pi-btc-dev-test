Nice one, I worked in games for quite a few years. (before getting
into finance then pentesting) there are about 6 keen testers now.
maybe we should get a bitcoin-test mailing list, where we can discuss
stuff without disturbing the dev team.

Great question... for me I feel structure is the most important thing
to sort out first.  However we desperately need detailed testcases for
the release of a new version. - Not too much on the change log stuff,
more on the noddy stuff (as gavin points out below), downloading and
making sure it works on a non dev machine, make sure the wallet isnt
overwritten, etc.) doing games qa I imagine this would be an ideal
place for you to start.  I have a MSDN and TechNet licence so if you
need some reference ms virtual machines I can help you out.

However we need some testcase software.  Please check out what was
done on bettermeans for the stuff I was planning out...

It details everything from recompense and testcases. bettermeans kinda
died a death though...

check out:

https://secure.bettermeans.com/projects/4256/boards
and
https://secure.bettermeans.com/projects/4256/wiki

I still have the testcases, but until we get some proper testcase
software I am loathed to publish them in a half arsed format. (they
worked well on bettermeans, then just vanished one day...) what
testcase software are you familiar with?

apart from that, what do you feel you can do for the project? how long
have you been involved in bitcoin?  It may well be worth reading up
all the dev stuff on the wiki so you can get you head around how the
bitcoin protocol is different from the daemon and qt client. What do
you think you can and will enjoy doing? What is your skill set in
regard to networking, crypto and operating systems. (not that you need
any, in any we still want and need you. :)

there really is room for you to do whatever role you want, and as
little or as much as you want - however funding is now a very tricky
issue. so much so that I am not sure I want anything to do with
it(distribution of coin based on work.). - I just paid for some logo
spec work out of my own pocket (for example).  I have some testers i
know irl who are willing to work for coin.

NOTE: This response has nothing to do with the bitcoin foundation.  I
am not a member of the foundation. I do not speak for them or even
probably with them. I am still trying to work out how much qa the
foundation should be responsible for, and/how it is supposed to work.
I think the games cert process would be ideal for this.  This however
this a discussion that probably wont have my involvement.  (personally
I believe that the foundation should publish requirements with example
code and testcases for each aspect of the reference client. (on
reference platforms - I do not expect many to agree with this though)

As a side note, what happens to the donations to the bitcoin testing
project? do they get moved over to the foundation? this question is
bigger than this email. as far as I know they are all on an address
Gavin holds. Actually I would like to be involved in any discussions
that would impact QA, does this mean I need to join the foundation or
just go lone wolf?

tbh I dont really understand foundations.  I always thought they were
just a tax dodge.

Sorry for the long message. :)
