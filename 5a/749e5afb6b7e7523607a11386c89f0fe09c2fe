That depends on the pool's reward scheme. Some complicated forms are capable 
of getting "bonus" earnings out of the pool. Under all systems, the attacker 
at least gains the "hurt the pool" benefit. Given the frequency of DDoS 
attacks on pools, it is clear there are people who will even pay for attacks 
that provide no other benefit than harming pools. Under all systems, the 
attacker doesn't lose out in any significant way.

If we wait until there's real pain, it will be a painful fork. If we plan it 
1-2 years out, people have time to upgrade on their own before it breaks.

With this attack, attackers can hurt the pool's "luck factor" *and* spend the 
bitcoins they earn to bribe users away.
