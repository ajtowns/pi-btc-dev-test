Jimmy Song,

Why would the actual end users of Bitcoin (the long term and short term owners of bitcoins) who run fully verifying nodes want to change Bitcoin policy in order to make their money more vulnerable to 51% attack?

If anything, we would be making policy changes to prevent the use of patented PoW algorithms instead of making changes to enable them.

Thanks,
Praxeology Guy
