I can think of a variety of protocols that broadcast information and don't
really care about whether it gets delivered.. Think of everything that uses
UDP on TCP/IP. The most basic thing I can think of would be low-priority
notifications that are sent to the entire Bitcoin universe, but don't need
to persist. The protocol provides for a signed and thus verified message,
and a method for broadcasting it to every node that might be interested in
seeing it. If it never makes it into a block, so be it. If it does, so be
it.
