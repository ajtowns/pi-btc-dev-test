Accepting that outcomes are less knowable further into the future is not
the same as failing to consider the future at all.  A responsible
project can't have a movie-plot roadmap.  It needs to give weight to
multiple possible future outcomes.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree

One way or another, the challenge is to decide what to do next.  Beyond
that, it's future decisions all the way down. 

Alan argues that 7 tps is a couple orders of magnitude too low for any
meaningful commercial activity to occur, and too low to be the final
solution, even with higher layers.  I agree.  I also agree with you,
that we don't really know how to accomplish 700tps right now.

What we do know is if we want to bump the limit in the short term, we
ought to start now, and until there's a better alternative root to the
decision tree, it just might be time to get moving.
