This particular attack seems quite dependant on the target not using the
deposit Tx as input. I believe this whole class of attacks become
ineffective if each account has it's own separate wallet.

Also, receiving a block with a transaction that hasn't been broadcast to
the network is in itself quite suspect. Are there cases where that
happens legitimately? Perhaps in such a case, don't treat the block it
came in as a confirmation at all. Instead, start counting from the next
one.
