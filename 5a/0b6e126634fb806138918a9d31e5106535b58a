If everyone votes to reallocate everyone elses blocks all the time, then
you'd end up losing your own coins too, so this doesn't seem like a
workable strategy.

I'm OK with burning actually. The total amount of coins in the system
essentially defines its maximum price resolution. Ideally we'd not lose
resolution, but it's less important than having a system that does actually
work. Moreover, this sort of system is like double spending defence itself
- if it does work, it doesn't need to actually be done very frequently
because people know the safeguards work and don't try. So in practice total
loss of resolution should be limited.

Right. It's indeed an assumption that block rewards matter to miners, even
the ones that have double spend revenues.
