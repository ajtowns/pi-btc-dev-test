Subject: [bitcoin-dev] A BIP proposal for segwit addresses
Message-ID: <CAPg+sBh0sFA7b6a+48Oojwy655GB9W6Th8JiCpd+2ruQjPev8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'd like to propose a new BIP for native segwit addresses to replace
BIP 142. These addresses are not required for segwit, but are more
efficient, flexible, and nicer to use.

The format is base 32 and uses a simple checksum algorithm with strong
error detection properties. Reference code in several languages as
well as a website demonstrating it are included.

You can find the text here:

Cheers,
