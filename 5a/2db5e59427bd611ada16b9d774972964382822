My apologies if this post has been answered, but I am new to the list. I am lawyer trying to understand the licensing of the Bitcoin core and I  will be presenting in a webinar with Black Duck Software on Blockchain on September 28  (in case you are not familiar with them, Black Duck Software assists companies in managing their open source software resources). They have scanned the Bitcoin Core code for the open source licenses used in the codebase.  I am enclosing a summary of the findings. I would be interested in communicating with the individuals who manage this codebase and can provide insight about the project manages contributions because the codebase includes projects with inconsistent licenses (for example, code licensed under the Apache Software License version  2 and GPLv2 cannot work together in some situations). Thanks in advance.

According to the scan, the code base includes code licensed under the following licenses:
