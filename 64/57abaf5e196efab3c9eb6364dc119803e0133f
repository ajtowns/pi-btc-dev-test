For the future evolution without considering DHTs:
While I think we will sooner or later have supernodes, I don't think they
will need to be trusted too much.
Supernodes will be those nodes that verify all transactions and make them
available to miners. Since miners will become more and more specialized
these supernodes are likely to be owned by the miners themself. To be a
miner either you need to verify all the transactions you include (otherwise
others might be able to find an error in your block and thus drop it) or
have someone that verifies them for you. In the end I think we'll end up
with a hierarchical network, with the miners/supernodes tighly
interconnected at the top and the lightweight clients that simply verify
transactions (or their inputs to be precise) that are destined for them at
the bottom.

As for the DHT we had a few brainstorming sessions a while back on the
forum http://bit.ly/sc2RLZ (gmaxwell didn't like it then either :D)
Forcing someone to participate in a fixed position in the block storage
network is a good way to reduce the risk of a sybil attack as Michael said.
The hash should include only information that cannot be changed by the
user, so IP can be used, but including the port is risky.

Broadcasting the transactions would not need to be done, since miners fetch
them from their storage place, alternatively we could use the inv broadcast
to notify peers about a new block/transaction and let it retrieve them from
the permanent storage (DHT or block storage network). If we route traffic
internally in the DHT we could even start caching at nodes leading to the
real location, since announcements would lead to flashcrowds, putting heavy
load on the responsible nodes. Caching is not a risk since the hash of the
object to be retrieved is already known.

Regards,
Chris
