To clarify:
BIP64 has a much stricter definition for accounts than BIP32.

In BIP32, it is not well specified what accounts are used for. They
can be used for "subwallets", "receive accounts" (as in bitcoind's
account feature), "recurring payments", part of a chain used as
multisig addresses, ... determined individually for each index.

In BIP64, they are strictly used for subwallets, and can't be used by
anything else.
