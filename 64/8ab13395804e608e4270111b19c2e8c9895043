This is a non-issue.

If the hard-fork is not a consensus, then those of us that don't consent
ignore the fool that tried to hard-fork.

If a fool attempting a non-consensus hard-fork actually breaks something,
then you have a fragile system that needs some serious re-thinking.

I think a non-consensus hard-fork would be the best thing that could 
happen to the bitcoin ecosystem long-term, because it would force some
re-examination of some very bad assumptions.
