It's great to finally see a BIP, although seems strange to ask for feedback
after releasing binaries.

In any case, the issue isn't about "whether or not it is a good idea to
roll out a hard fork", the question has always been about how to do safe
hard fork deployment and what the technological requirements are for doing
so. Your BIP/blogs do not actually address any of this. 75% miner
signalling with a 28 day flag day thereafter gives virtually no time for
the entire ecosystem to migrate and is widely considered unsafe. It's
plainly obvious that an entire ecosystem of 5000 full nodes cannot be
prepared in a month.
