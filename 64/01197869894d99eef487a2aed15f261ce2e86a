Or we could take a step back, further into "don't reinvent the wheel"
territory. Why not simply make use of PGP(/EC) to sign and verify messages?
It has many advantages, like an already existing web-of-trust and keyserver
infrastructure.

I still feel like this is sign message stuff is dragging the kitchen sink
into Bitcoin. It's fine for logging into a website, what you use it for,
but anything that approaches signing email (such as S/MIME implementations
and handling different character encodings) is going too far IMO.
