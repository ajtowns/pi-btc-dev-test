With all respect to your experience, I think you're wrong, for one reason.

2fa auth doesn't *remove* the need of password. It actually *adds* yet
another layer, which complicates stuff for average user. Common user, which
is not paranoid enough (like me) simply don't think he has anything to
hide, so they simply don't see why they should *complicate* their live with
2fa, backing up their phone etc.

In the oposite, authentication based on bitcoin wallet could make the
process much easier and remove the need of passwords at all, because people
*already* care about safe storage of their coins.
