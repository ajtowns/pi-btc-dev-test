While I think that it's silly that we don't have a HTTPS (only!) page,
it should be noted that an HTTPS page is in no way a replacement for
GPG, sadly:  Anyone who can MITM the server to the whole internet can
trivially obtain a fraudulent cert with only moderate cost and time.

(The reason for this is that (many? most? all?) CAs verify authority
by having you place a file at some HTTP path on the domain in
question. Effectively the current CA model only prevents those from
intercepting who cannot intercept the traffic generally. Basically
only helps with the evil hotspot/tor_exit problem.)
