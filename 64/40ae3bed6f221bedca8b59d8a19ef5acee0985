It's least surprising if the wallet works as a SPV client by default.
Then, users can use it without first setting up a core. Thus the idea
would be to use P2P primarily.

There could be a mode to use a trusted core by RPC for
mempool/conflicted transaction validation and such. But I'm not sure
about this - as we've seen, pure-SPV wallets work pretty well. If you
want it to act as an edge router you can point a SPV wallet at your
trusted core as well.

There are no plans for adding Electrum-like functionality to bitcoind.
There is already Electrum. Let's not reinvent any wheels.

Right, the wallet would keep track of those.

It does not need to keep a full chain database. But it needs its own
record of the chain, headers-only + what concerns the keys in the
wallet.
