 >So I'm *not* the decider for anything that concerns the behavior of 
the global consensus, and I cannot be, as I have explained in the 
previous post.

The person who decides if a pull request is accepted is a decider and 
significantly affects the behavior of the global consensus.  The only 
option for someone who doesn't agree is to hard fork.  There is no way 
around that and you should just accept that fact and move on.
