Even if you could find such a transaction that contained its own digest, and even if such a transaction were valid, it still couldn't conjure new coins into existence. The sum of the outputs must be less than or equal to the sum of the inputs (except in the case of a coinbase transaction). If a transaction were to spend its own output, then the input would be completely used up by the output, leaving no balance for a second output.
