I think that pretty much sums it up.

With the block-range served in the anounce message you just need to find
an annoucement with the right range, and at worst connect to a few more
node to get what you need. It will be a long time before the bandwidth
used for finding a node with the part of the chain that you need is a
significant fraction of the load required for downloading the data
itself.

Remember that BitTorrent's DHT is a system giving you access to tens of
petabytes worth of data. The Bitcoin blockchain on the other hand simply
can't grow more than 57GiB per year. It's a cute idea though.


Also, while we're talking about the initial download:

Lots of options out there.
