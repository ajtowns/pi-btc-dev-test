Assume as a premise (despite your apparent disagreement below) that for 
Bitcoin to function, a supermajority of economic activity needs to be verified 
using full nodes operated by the recipient. Evidence suggests that at this 
current time, at best 10% of economic activity is in fact using a full node to 
verify the transaction. On this basis, it seems pretty clear that serious 
action must be taken to change the status quo, and so for efforts to do so 
without dropping the block size have proven ineffective.

Satoshi envisioned a system where full nodes could publish proofs of invalid 
blocks that would be automatically verified by SPV nodes and used to ensure 
even they maintained the equivalent of full node security so long as they were 
not isolated. But as a matter of fact, this vision has proven impossible, and 
there is to date no viable theory on how it might be fixed. As a result, the 
only way for nodes to have full-node-security is to actually be a true full 
node, and therefore the plan of only having full nodes in datacenters is 
simply not realistic without transforming Bitcoin into a centralised system.

I think it's likely safe to say that if this were a possibility, everyone 
would want to continue to move in that direction. But as the facts stand, it 
simply isn't possible.
