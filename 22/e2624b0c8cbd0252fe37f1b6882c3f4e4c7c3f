We've reflected many comments about BIP39 wordlist from the community and I
think the wordlist is much better now. Specifically we removed many of
theoretically offensive words as well as we implemented algorithm for
detecting words with similar characters (cat/eat) and we resolved these
duplicities. I'm now quite happy with the wordlist and I want to ask you
for next (final?) round of comments.

>From other features, we added password protection of seed and seed
hardening (against bruteforcing) using Rijndael cipher. This has been
chosen because its blocksize can be 128, 192 or 256 bits, so it fits length
of desired seeds. Also there are Rijndael implementations in every
language. Btw password protection has one interesting feature - plausible
deniability. It allows user to have one mnemonic and by using it with
different passwords, it will generate different BIP32 wallets.... (wink
wink)

I want to be pretty clear that we need to close this topic somehow, because
we want to use such algorithm in Trezor (which deadline is coming quick)
and also other wallet developers want to implement such algorithm into
clients to be compatible with Trezor. There were quite strict requirements
for such algorithm (like the possibility to convert mnemonic to seed as
well as seed to mnemonic) and I think we found a good solution. I'm wildly
asking you for constructive comments, but saying "it's a crap, I don't like
it" won't help anything.

Thanks,
slush
