OK, it might fit if you don't use any of the features the protocol provides
:) You can try it here:

It's not "utterly broken", that's over-dramatic. It's just the best that
can be done with todays technology. I wrote about the SSL PKI and how it's
being upgraded here:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=300809.0

If you're thinking about governments and so on subverting CA's, then there
is a plan for handling that (outside the Bitcoin world) called certificate
transparency which is being implemented now.

Now when you are getting a QR code from the web, it's already being served
over HTTPS. So if you're up against an attacker who can break a CA in order
to steal your money, then you already lose, the QRcode itself as MITMd.

In the Bluetooth case we might have to keep the address around and use it
to do ECDHE or something like that. The current BT support doesn't need
that because it's just blasting out a tx, the entire protocol is write
only. Once it's reading data as well then it'll need a custom security
layer.
