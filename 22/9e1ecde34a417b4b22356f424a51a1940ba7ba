Let me ask a simpler question. How do you prove the state of the UTXO
database corresponding to your wallet? With my subchain method, all the
addresses in a wallet can be constrained to a path of subchains, so the
proof is O(log n). Yes, I know some people will say that it is not really a
proof because I didn't verify the transactions involving sibling chains
outside my path of chains. But the protocol is "parent chain always decides
in case of conflict". And the parent chains will have an incentive to be
careful with what child blocks they commit to as they will be merge mining
the (direct) child chains. Yes, the parents can make a mistake with some
really deep children chain transactions, but the deeper you go, the less
value the transactions, and the less important. Also, the children of the
parents are parents themselves so they will have incentive to be careful
with what child chains they commit to. So recursively, the system takes
care of itself.

I challenge anyone to come up with a <= O(log n) proof that each address
(output) they have in their wallet really has the balance they think it
has. If someone can do this, then maybe I will drop this idea. Actually,
rusty asked this on #bitcoin-wizards last night and no one was able to
answer it.
