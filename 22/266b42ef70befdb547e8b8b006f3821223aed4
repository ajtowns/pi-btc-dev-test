Let's just increase the version number and be done with this discussion.
It's a small benefit, but it simplifies things and it's trivial to do.

I don't understand how a policy of requiring version increases could limit
future extensions: after the version/verack exchange, the protocol version
is negotiated between peers, and there is no need for anything optional
anymore.

Note thay this is just about parsing, not about relaying - you should still
relay parts of a message you haven't parsed. But that doesn't apply to the
version message anyway, which is the only place where this matters.
