I assume you mean that they don't have a Bitcoin Core node that is open to 
incoming connections. Since that is the only thing you can actually test, no?

Most companies are still terrified of accepting incoming connections from the 
scary Internet. So I'm not entirely surprised by this conclusion.  I would be 
very surprised if companies don't actually have a node at all.
