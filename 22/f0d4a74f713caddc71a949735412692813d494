Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Multi party Schnorr Rust implementation
Message-ID: <CALhDas2W5QEPmw8JEgak0zf7y3N0UFTiMVk-djR8x9_WYZiyfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am working for the past few months with collaborators (in cc) on
providing Rust reference implementations to existing multi party schemes
for Schnorr signatures [1]. This includes aggregated signatures,
accountable signatures (which for n out of n are multi-signatures) and
threshold signatures (wip).
The project can be found here:
https://github.com/KZen-networks/multi-party-schnorr .
We aim that if the protocol is run in a configuration of a single party it
will be bip-schnorr [2] compliant.

Hope you'll find it useful :)
Questions, suggestions and pull requests are welcome!
