This unnecessarily complicates transaction selection for miners by
introducing a second (and possibly third if I understand your proposal
correctly) dimension to try to optimize.

See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem

Segwit already solves this exact issue by replacing block size with block
weight, so I fail to see how this proposal would make any improvements
without introducing significant complications.
