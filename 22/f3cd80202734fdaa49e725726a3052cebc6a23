I wish that was the case. It would have made my life a lot easier in the 
past. A lot of the MIME libraries out there are extremely buggy. MIME is 
just difficult to work with, and support is still weak.

Undefined content length + text based boundaries = pain in the ass.

It is in the e-mail module because that's all MIME was originally 
intended for. It's now grown beyond that now, but you will find the MIME 
functions still live in the e-mail libraries. When dealing with raw MIME 
encoded data, e-mail is still the most common case.
