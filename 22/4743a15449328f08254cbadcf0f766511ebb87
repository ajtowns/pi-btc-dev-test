Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP70: why Google Protocol Buffers for

ASN.1 is not nearly as flexible when it comes to well-supported libraries,
generators, and the ecosystem that surrounds the actual encoding.  You
don't see ASN.1 compilers + language support packages for [all popular
programming languages], as you do with protobufs.

Google engineers were well aware it existed I'm sure.  There are wider
considerations beyond the low-level specified format.

Protobufs have their problems and aren't perfect, but ASN.1 ecosystem is
far less developed in the programming ecosystem, far less approachable for
programmers.  BIP70 wouldn't have been as easily and widely adopted if
ASN.1 had been chosen.
