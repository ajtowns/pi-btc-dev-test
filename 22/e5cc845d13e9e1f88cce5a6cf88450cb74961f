Yes, you're right, the Bitcoin Foundation is facing many challenges, but
that's an entirely different discussion.

The question in hand is this: was the request to remove Gavin made by an
individual of their own volition, reflecting their own personal opinion,
or was it made on behalf of the company?

If the latter, it would imply that compromise is unlikely to be reached
and thus the ecosystem should start planning immediately for the
potential hard fork, rather than waiting and hoping for things to be
resolved.
