That strongly depends on the value of the compromised machine to the
attacker. If he has syphoned all the data from it and has no further
use for it then the he will probably trip the tripwire to get the
coins even though this will make the compromise apparent. If however
he is planning to use it as a foothold to further compromise your
company, send spam or similar, he will likely try to avoid these
tripwires. In which case a classic honeypot, that attempts to look
like a regular system is what you're looking for.
