You are killing us Mike! :) We really don't like to think that BWS is
a webwallet. Note
that private keys are not stored (not even encrypted) at the server. Addresses
can be generated offline, funds received and transferred by the peers
without accessing
BWS.

Currently Copay uses the encrypted blob idea (checks balances and tx
history thought Insight), but after working with Copay for ~6 months
we think having some visibility of the wallet by the multisig
facilitator will make the user experience much better (e.g: mobile
notifications).

Thanks for the Subspace reference, we will definitely check it.

Interesting point. IMO, if we can prevent the server from having the xpubs keys
it would be valuable: It will give us more flexibility for future
features, and if the server is compromised future addresses will not
be known by the attacker, but of course we need to evaluate the cost.
