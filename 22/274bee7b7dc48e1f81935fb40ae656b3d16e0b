But that option is not unknown, that's the point of this thread.
"Doing nothing" would require to fix the mempool to scale with the
number of unconfirmed transaction. This is something that we will
eventually have to fix unless the plan is to eventually remove the
blocksize limit.
What will happen with full blocks is that fees will likely rise and
the transactions with bigger fees will get confirmed first. This is
something that will eventually happen unless the blocksize limit is
removed before ever being hit.
What this thread is saying is that this option (the so-called "doing
nothing" option, which actually requires more work than any of the
current proposals for increasing the blocksize) is perfectly valid,
which is in contradiction to a perceived "need to increase the
blocksize limit soon". Increasing the block size is only an option,
not a "need". And changing the consensus rules and forcing everybody
to adapt their software to the changes is certainly not "maintaining
the status quo", I'm getting tired of hearing that absurd notion.
