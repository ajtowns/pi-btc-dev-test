OK - from your path it looks like linux. What version of Boost do you use. I require 1.47 or 1.48. - I will change that, but it is quite handy for signal_sets - will make an alternative scheme though.

And, as for 0.4 vs 0.5 - I have tried to follow the changes, which were mostly (?) related to the integration of the qt client, which would have to be re-done anyway. Then there were some deadlock fixes, that I don't need ;). A fix for a special attack, that I have included. But I will go over everything again.

Cheers,

M
