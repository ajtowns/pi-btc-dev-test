How do you define opaque? As far as humans are concerned the addresses are
opaque. They don't tell anything about your country or location, your bank,
your name, they don't even form some kind of hierarchy.

>From the viewpoint of the code you could argue they have a meaning "address
type + hashed public key, base58 encoded" thus are not fully opaque. But
it's a long shot, as a hashed value is still very opaque.

No, there have been no changes to base58. The encoding is still exactly the
same as when Satoshi coined it. Can you show an example of what you mean?
