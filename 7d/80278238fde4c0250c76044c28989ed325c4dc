Seems that Peter is describing a system that requires no changes at all to the
Bitcoin codebase and thus there are no costs whatsoever.

Peter: I'm a bit confused by this concept of "bi-directional sacrifice" though,
I assume there exists only a sacrifice in one direction right? Wouldn't selling
a zerocoin be just a matter of giving zerocoin a rule so that the zerocoin tx
moving it to the new owner only happens if a specific form of bitcoin tx
happens too?

Merge mining is very much mining a coin for free. Ask not what the total reward
is, ask that the marginal cost of merge mining an additional coin is. The issue
is that unless there is a cost to mining a *invalid* block the merge mined coin
has little protection from miners who mine invalid blocks, either maliciously
or through negligence. If the coin isn't worth much, either because it's market
value is low or the worth is negative to the malicious miner, your theories of
value have nothing to do with the issue.

Gregory Maxwell has written about this issue before on the #bitcoin-dev IRC
channel and on bitcointalk as well if memory serves. I advise you to look up
his description of the problem, almost everything he writes on the topic of
crypto-coin theory is spot-on correct.
