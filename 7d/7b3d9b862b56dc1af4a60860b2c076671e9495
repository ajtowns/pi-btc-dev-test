Subject: [bitcoin-dev] SegWit GBT updates
Message-ID: <201601301850.03469.luke@dashjr.org>

I've completed an initial draft of a BIP for updating getblocktemplate for 
segregated witness here:
    https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/segwit_gbt/bip-segwit-gbt.mediawiki

Please review and comment (especially with regard to the changes in the 
sigoplimits handling).

(Note: libblkmaker's reference implementation is at this time incompatible 
with the "last output" rule in this BIP.)

Thanks,

Luke
