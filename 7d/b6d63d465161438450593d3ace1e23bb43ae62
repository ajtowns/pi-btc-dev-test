FWIW, based on statistics for Eligius's past 100 blocks, it seems 10% (1 in 
10) of 1-txn blocks is not actually unreasonable. This also means these 1-txn 
mined blocks are not necessarily harming Bitcoin intentionally. Anyone care to 
figure out the math for how fast miners need to finish processing transactions 
to reduce the number of 1txn blocks?
