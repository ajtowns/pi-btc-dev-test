The relevant question would be to ask whether encryption would prevent an ISP from doing so (which it would not). This is a good example of false sense of security.

FWIW I was just answering your question comprehensively. Relationship to BIP151 is incidental (though apparently applicable).

Keep in mind my specific concern is not with the design of BIP151, it is with the implication of its dependency on an unspecified authentication proposal.

The security tradeoff would arise from widespread deployment of authentication - which is necessary to make encryption useful against envisioned MITM attacks. See my previous discussion of trust zones below.

Simply put, any code that is unnecessary does not justify its cost.

TOFU (trust on first use) was a reference to what was discussed on IRC as a potential solution to the (deferred) authentication problem. I didn't mean to imply that it was part of BIP151.

This is a restatement of what I have accepted as a premise - that authentication, and as such, key distribution, will be a necessary part of making any encryption scheme effective. "Preshared" implies a secure side channel for key distribution.

Whether or not there are multiple schemes is not relevant to the point I have raised. The issue is that authentication is necessary.

We should contemplate what the distributed permissionless network of anonymous peers looks like once every node authenticates every one of its peers using one or more key distribution side channels.

I fully appreciate the significant security risk arising from the proliferation of web wallets. This can only be resolved by people validating using code under their own control.

Encryption/authentication are orthogonal to this question, assuming people have wallets directly attached to full nodes. Remoting a wallet from a full node does not require use of the P2P protocol, and can use encryption/authentication without the concerns I've raised. It properly places the trust boundary around a wallet and its trusted node(s), as opposed to spanning (independent) nodes.

This is an unfair statement. You have acknowledged that BIP151 requires authentication to accomplish its sole objective.

As I pointed out.

Again, it's the fact that authentication is required that produces the issue, not that there are multiple ways to implement it.

I don't see how this is relevant.

It seems that we are talking past each other. You haven't yet addressed the issue that I have raised.

It is the requirement for authentication of any node that any other node may wish to connect to that is the issue. We end up with something that looks like WoT or PKI. And if not fully controlled by PKI (so using WoT) we will have hybrid nodes that accept untrusted connections and propagate information between trusted and untrusted nodes.
