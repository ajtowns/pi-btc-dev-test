I'm supporting this proposal and since I'm already using the Encompass
wallet software I would like to highlight that this use case is not only
practical but has already a working reference implementation.

The only donwside I see is that it means we get yet another HD wallet
definition.

Is there anything else what would speak against assigning a BIP number
to this proposal? This would allow kefkius and his team to use the
standard in Encompass and share it with other software packages which
might be interested in using deterministic cross-currency wallets.
