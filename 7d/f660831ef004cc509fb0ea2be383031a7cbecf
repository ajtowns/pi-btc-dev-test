Hi

No I don't agree with the analysis.

Yes, the PaymentRequest can be stored with the same security as the private
keys are stored. The big difference is that the keys never leave the
wallet. As soon as that PaymentRequest leaves the wallet on its way to the
hotel server, it is up for grabs which makes it inappropriate for use as a
proof of payment other than for resolving disputes and other one-time stuff.
