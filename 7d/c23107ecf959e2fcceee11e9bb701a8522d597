No, that's not it. Sorry for not being clear. Independence of control is
the central issue in the analysis of a multiple factor system. If an
attack compromises one factor there must be no way for that attack to
reduce the difficulty of obtaining the other factors.

Some factors (secrets), like a fingerprint, aren't very secret at all.
But getting someone's fingerprint doesn't also help the attacker get a
PIN. That factor must be attacked independently. But if the PIN is
encrypted with the fingerprint in a public store, then the PIN is not
independent of the fingerprint and there is really only one secret.

If multiple factors are coincident (located within the same security
perimeter) they are compromized coincidentally. Coincidence has the same
effect as dependence. Consider a credit card with a "security code"
printed on the back. A successful attack on the leather wallet yields
both secrets.

Individual environments can be compromised with some difficulty (e.g.
desktop malware, fingerprint lift, dictionary attack, brute force PIN,
etc.). For the sake of simplicity, let that chance of successful
independent attack on any factor be 1 in 2 and the resulting probability
of successful concurrent attack on any n factors be 1 in 2^n. If m
factors are dependent/coincident on others the relation becomes 1 in
2^(n-m).

Any multi-factor web wallet that handles the user's keys in the browser
and authenticates the user in the browser to authorize service signing
is effectively single factor. One attack may be launched by an insider,
or externally, against the web app, executing in the browser, gaining
coincident access to two secrets. Browser/desktop malware can accomplish
the same. The difficulty is 1 in 2 vs. the expected 1 in 4.

I'm not questioning the motive, I agree it's worth trying. But trying is
not succeeding. Increasing user (and/or system) complexity without
increasing integrity or privacy is a poor trade, and worse if the user
is misled.
