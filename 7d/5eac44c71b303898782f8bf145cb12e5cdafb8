In the innocent use case of this opcode, a double-spend has already occurred, 
and this should be a strict improvement. In the non-innocent abuse of this 
opcode, I don't see that it's any worse than simply double-spending.

Would this proposal be better or otherwise more acceptable, if a specified 
height more recent than 100 blocks deep causes the script to fail? This would 
increase delays in recovering the double-spend situation of course... but less 
than 24h.
