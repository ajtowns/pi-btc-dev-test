Indeed, that has been proposed but it's a dumb idea and I'm very sceptical
it will go anywhere.  Certainly no decision was made. The arguments for it
are based on some quite faulty thinking about economics. Double spend
notifications have been proposed a long time ago, I believe Matt has
indicated some interest in implementing them and that is the right way to
go.
