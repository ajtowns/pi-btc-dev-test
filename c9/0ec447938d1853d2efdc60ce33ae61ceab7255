How are you going to authenticate the host? Certificates from CAs are how 
HTTPS does it. HTTP is vulnerable. If the URI contains an address (eg, 
bitcoin://remotehost/base58key), the remote host could sign its (self-signed) 
SSL key with the ECDSA key to prove authenticity. DNSSEC/namecoin presumably 
has some way to do this as well.

At some point, a proper protocol to negotiate payment is needed for anything 
like this.
