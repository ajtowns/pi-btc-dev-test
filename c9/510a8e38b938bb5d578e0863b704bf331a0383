Oh, I absolutely agree that this type of attack is NOT the weakest link in security. There are MANY far easier targets in bitcoind and typical use scenarios of it. If we want to dramatically improve the security of a typical bitcoin wallet, the FLUSH+RELOAD attack is probably not where our efforts would be best rewarded trying to prevent.

However, this thread IS about this particular attack vector - and my suggestion IS specific to this thread.

You can't give the argument that the RPC API is password protected because the password is stored in plain-text in the config so all someone has to do is first grep for the file. There doesn't appear to be a way to force ALL outgoing transactions to be multisig and even if there was one, would you be able to force one of the addresses to be the "hardened" server? That still wouldn't prevent anyone from just stopping bitcoind, changing the config, then restarting it.

Other software, like MySQL has access controls so I can prevent ALTERs, DROPs, DELETEs, etc for all "live" accounts limiting the scope of any attack if they manage to get into the server. Maybe this is beyond the scope of bitcoind, not sure.
