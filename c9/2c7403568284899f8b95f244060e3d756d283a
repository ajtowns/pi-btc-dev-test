It still isn't perfect.  Everyone has an incentive to wait until the
last minute to pledge. <<

AC does not solve the problem. AC works if people gain directly from
the payment. Imagine a group of people paying tax - nobody gains from
paying it. You have to actually need to enforce negative outcomes to
enable it (jail for tax fraud). Hence in Bitcoin we have the enforced
subsidy. AFAIK the problem of how to incentivize transaction
verification without subsidy is unsolved. Who determines a fair price?
People around here should study more economics, game theory, etc.
instead of debating low level encodings all the time.
