A recent comment on this (I think)...

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4564#issuecomment-49558760

Reflecting on an approach from a different but related project, as a
result of an issue discussion in DW, stealth and coinjoin from that
project were broken out as distinct repositories - see:

https://github.com/darkwallet/stealth.js
and
https://github.com/darkwallet/coinjoin.js

installable using npm


I'm probably missing something here, but it seems to me like breaking
things out as distinct repositories might be a good approach.  The
question is what would be in a distinct repository or repositories?
Currently if someone is looking at core, everything is seen here:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/
