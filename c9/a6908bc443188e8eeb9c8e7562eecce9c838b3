It may not be our place to say whether XP is secure or not, but if we say that we support it then we have to run test passes against XP as a platform, and if an XP user reports a bug, then we have to do something to address it.  So, it becomes a test and support issue, not a security issue.

That?s why it doesn?t make sense to support an OS platform that the original vendor (MS) no longer supports themselves.
