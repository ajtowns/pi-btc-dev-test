Regarding 80 bytes vs smaller: The objectives should be that if you are
determined to put some extra data in the blockchain, OP_RETURN should be
the superior alternative. if a user can include more data with less fees
using a multisig TX, then this will happen.

eventually dust-limit rules will not be the deciding factor here, since
i suspect block propagation times will have a stronger effect on
effective fees. therefore a slightly larger payload than the biggest
multisig TX is the right answer. - that would be >= 64x3 bytes = 192 bytes.
(this is my understanding of how large a 3-of-3 multisig tx can be, plus
1.5 bits encoded in the "n" parameter)
