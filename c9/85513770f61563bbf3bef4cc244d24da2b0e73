Yea, I think in any hardfork that we should be talking about, a part of
it should include 1) fix the version field so its a static constant, 2)
the merkle root becomes hash of the real block header 3) swap first 2
bytes of the merkle root with the timestamp's two high-order bits, 4)
swap the next 4 bytes of the merkle root with the difficulty field.

I believe this should be compatible with all existing ASICs, with the
exception, possibly, of some 21 Inc hardware. I believe this fixes
AsicBoost (without thinking about it tooo much, so please critique).

While this is somewhat nasty, the risks of AsicBoost and the precedent
that should be set necessitates a response, and it should be included in
any hardfork.
