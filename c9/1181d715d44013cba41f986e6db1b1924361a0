Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal: Extended serialization format for BIP-32
	wallets
Message-ID: <0d405f5d-c0a4-bad7-b6c3-08ba4424bf17@satoshilabs.com>

The discussion about changing bip32 version bytes for SegWit got me
thinking and I ended up with what I think is the best proposal:

https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0032.md

(It is hosted in SL repo for now, but if there is will, I would love to
have this added to BIP repo as an extension to BIP32)

Feel free to comment.
