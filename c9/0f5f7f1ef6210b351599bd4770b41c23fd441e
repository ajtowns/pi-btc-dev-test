I do not think that a line can be drawn here. As far as I understood,
you think that the coin limit is a meaningful underlying principle
which should not be touched, whereas the halving of mining rewards is
an implementation detail. The two are very closely tied together and
changes to both of them would result in a hardfork, if I am not
mistaken.

Regarding the effects of the mining reward halving, there is a nice
paper from courtois:
http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0534

All the best
Henning
