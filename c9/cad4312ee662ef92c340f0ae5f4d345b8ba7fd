Bitcoin (as well as the internet, and the world wide web) is already
regulated around the world.
There used to be a map that documented this fairly well, called
bitlegal (bitlegal.net) but the site is now parked or offline.  There
is an alternative visual picture of the subject at:
http://is.gd/vFgYrf
The upshot of that is that web wallets (which are popularized due to
convenience) cannot be considered to provide users with control over
their money - extended discussion on this here in the bitcoin.org
repository:
https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/996

My question, therefore is this:
When you say "it will be pressured into regulation, eventually," what
do you mean? Are you implying that even the hardware wallets and
desktop wallets for bitcoin will be regulated to the point where they
cannot be used by individuals who actually care about being able to
circumvent financial censorship?  If so, explain how that is the case.

 I could see an argument where that might be the case to some degree
if you would mention it in the context of services like Chainalysis
and other companies that are in the process of setting up services for
corporation-states for "virtual currency compliance;" e.g.; if
activity can be scanned and if a state has a requirement you are
supposed to be registered with the state to use virtual currency at
some level, and if companies scan the blockchain and report this
information to states (as they now do), then as you say, the only
reasonable method of using virtual currencies would be one in which
location is masked and information about the nodes and history of
transactions can be hidden.  However, this requires more privacy and
anonymity effort in bitcoin development, but I don't think it would
actually keep people from using hardware and desktop wallets (although
I do think eventually people will, as they are beginning to now, be
gradually censored more and more from utilizing web wallets for
activities that they desire).

It seems to me that the existence of various tools and conditions
(external to the whole issue of legal constraints) are also very
important.  For example, various companies have recently made public
announcements that they will leave (or not operate in) New York due to
Bitlicense - Kraken, Shapeshift.io, poloniex, and others.  It's
understandable given the extreme nature of NY's approach (I personally
oppose any regulation of virtual currencies).  But technically, they
didn't have to cease operating, did they?  This was a failure in their
business model.  They made a big statement about how evil NY was and
fled the scene, perhaps never to return to serve NY.  (Note, I don't
live in NY, so I'm not personally being left out in the cold when
Kraken etc. leave, for the record.) As said, this was a failure in
Kraken, poloniex's, shapeshift's, etc., business model.  Why?  Because
here we are talking about web-based services.  A distributed,
decentralized, peer-to-peer model in which the user has a piece of
software on their computer (think openbazaar or bitsquare) is far and
away better than services which are web based.  Why?  Because systems
which are set up such as (openbazaar, bitsquare) don't have to worry
about the constraints of state boundaries or shifting legal things,
nor do the people who made the software end up holding keys on behalf
of the users.  If Kraken, poloniex, etc., had bothered to develop
contingency software (similar to what is being worked on with
https://bitsquare.io/ for example) for users who might be affected in
jurisdictions where corporation-states Just Don't Get It (read... NY,
and possibly CA, as examples) then maybe they wouldn't have to worry
about it at all.  It just would be a matter of users installing a
piece of software from their website, discontinuing the web-based
exchange for that state, and directing users for highly regulated
states to a download page for the decentralized exchange software.
Not that hard really - but something we haven't seen done yet by the
big exchanges.

I have another question for you below...

Why do you say 8GB / block would destroy the very nature of Bitcoin?
I don't see that it would destroy bitcoin... but also, what would
cause 8GB to happen very soon?  As I understood it, any process would
phase increases.  Explain how that would destroy the very nature of
Bitcoin?

Blocksize is extremely likely to get bigger (I'm supposing here that
some version of Garzik's BIP 100 or something very close to it is what
will likely be adopted and that the blocksize would be voted on
something like this:
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/37943/bip-100-what-votes-are
- -possible

Am I wrong?  Please let me know if I'm dumb.

I am aware consensus isn't precisely there yet, but I'm just curious.
