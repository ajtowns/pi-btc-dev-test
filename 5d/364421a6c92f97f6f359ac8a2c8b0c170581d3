Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin v0.3.24 release candidate available
Message-ID: <CA+8xBpeJcz-RJ9EtDKB-svu=chBQUNzsBPRi8ts+8-0bGHnFNw@mail.gmail.com>

Bitcoin v0.3.24 release candidate #1 is now available for download at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.24/test/

This is another bug fix release.  We had hoped to have wallet
encryption ready for release, but more urgent fixes for existing
clients were needed.  Wallet encryption is ready for testing at
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/352 for the git-savvy, and
-hopefully- will follow shortly in the next release, v0.4.

Notable fixes in v0.3.24:

F1) Block downloads were failing or taking unreasonable amounts of
time to complete, because the increased size of the block chain was
bumping up against some earlier buffer-size DoS limits.
F2) Fix crash caused by loss/lack of network connection.

Notable changes in v0.3.24:
C1) DNS seeding enabled by default.
C2) UPNP enabled by default in the GUI client.  The percentage of
bitcoin clients that accept incoming connections is quite small, and
that is a problem.  This should help.  bitcoind, and unofficial
builds, are unchanged (though we encourage use of "-upnp" to help the
network!)
C3) Initial unit testing framework.  Bitcoin sorely needs automated
tests, and this is a beginning.  Contributions welcome.
C4) Internal wallet code cleanup.  While invisible to an end user,
this change provides the basis for v0.4's wallet encryption.
