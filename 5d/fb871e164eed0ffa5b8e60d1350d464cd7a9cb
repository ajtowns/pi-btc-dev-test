You and Gavin could do a lot better by working on a Bitcoin social
contract - a promise of what features will *never* be added (or taken
away) from Bitcoin, because despite what you say it's not acceptable
to propose anything at all.

Maybe start with things like how the Bitcoin protocol will never be
changed to allow for confiscation of funds, regardless of who might
demand such a feature.

You are willing to promise all users of Bitcoin that you'll never
propose to steal their coins, aren't you?
