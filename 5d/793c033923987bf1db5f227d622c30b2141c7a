Increasing the sigop count for a NOP would be a hard fork, but such a
change would be fine with a new segwit version. It might require specific
support in the altcoin, which might be troublesome..

It is a soft fork since it makes things that were previous allowed
disallowed.  If it decreased the sigop count, then you could create a block
that had to many sigops due to the old rules.

With this rule, it increases the count.  If the sigop count is valid under
the new rules, it is also valid under the old rules.

There is no need for specific support on the altcoin.  It allows the
Bitcoin network act as trusted 3rd party so that you can do channels safely
on the altcoin, even though the altcoin still suffers from malleability and
doesn't have OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.

With regards to seg-witness, Ideally, the opcode would work in both old and
new scripts by re-purposing OP_NOP3.
