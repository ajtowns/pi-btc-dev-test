Well, I strongly disagree with adopting the BIP as it stands.

No, those are not network-level changes. They are mere software changes that 
can be deployed along with the rest of the proposal.

"Standard" means defined in a BIP. To date, there are no standard 
transactions using OP_RETURN period. IsStandard is a node policy that should 
have no influence on future BIPs.

Such changes should not be made until there is a standard for them.
