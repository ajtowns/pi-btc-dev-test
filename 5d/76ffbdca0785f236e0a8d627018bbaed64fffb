You need to check transaction's dependencies up to a certain depth to know
whether it is safe:
 If one of inputs depends on transaction which is signed by parties with
unknown trustworthiness, then it isn't safe.

You need to check transaction's dependencies up to a certain depth to know
whether it is safe:
  If one of inputs depends on transaction time-locked script (or other
unrecognized script), then it isn't safe.

Situation is identical, you might need several extra lines of code.

I think it would matter only if we had deterministic, reliable mempool and
reorganization behavior. But it's not something we can depend on.
