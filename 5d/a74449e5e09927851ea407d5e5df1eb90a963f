There's a large array of solutions that are bigger than the cheapest home
broadband, but smaller then renting hardware in a data center.  Every
company with internet service to their location purchases one of these
options.  If Bitcoin full node bandwidth requirements ever exceed a
hobbyist's reach, s/he can always pool resources with other individuals to
purchase one of these solutions, and a 1-room office.

How many of you have connected to multiple ISPs and are routing internet
traffic between them?  But TCP is still permissionless.

Bitcoin node requirements will grow beyond a hobbyist reach (but not that
of the garage entrepreneur).   The truth is that as technologies grow and
mature, the hobbyists move on but anyone who has a real reason to continue
using it stays.  This fact does not destroy its decentralization.

I do not think that reasonable scaling will significantly affect full node
quantity (historical downtrends are conflated with the simultaneous
transition from hobbyist to professional).

At the same time the ability to create an independent full node is a
tremendous force keeping existing full nodes honest -- this potential is
more powerful then the fact.

Which would you choose, a 10 thousand node strong bankCoin, or a 1000 node
open source permissionless Bitcoin?
