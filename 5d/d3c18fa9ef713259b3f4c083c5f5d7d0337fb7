Names clearly solve a different problem than that, but we still use them,
so they must be solving _some_ problem :p  In this case they're a unique
identifier humans can remember after a bit of use and easily communicate to
each other with little room for error.  Securely mapping them to public
keys would make key verification simpler.  Simpler than checking a much
larger key fingerprint, at least.  Like I said, it's probably a niche
product ;)

I used to remember dozens of phone numbers before my phone did it for me,
but maybe I was just weird.
