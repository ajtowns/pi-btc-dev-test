Bitcoin is a binary system. Not all payment outputs are necessarily 
serializable into addresses, and assuming they are would be broken-by-design.
In other words, why send the user's *software* "pay to address foo" just to 
have it turn that into a script (of limited subset), when you can send the 
script itself and avoid all the possible problems? Doing this right also means 
that if the user's client doesn't support version 255 addresses, it still 
works fine.

JSON isn't problem-free at high-level either. To summarize one of the issues, 
almost every implementation of JSON treats Numbers differently based on 
whether they have a '.' in them or not.

MIME has been around much longer, and should have sufficient support in every 
language by now. For some reason, Python calls the module 'email'.
