Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Implementing Confidential Transactions in extension
	blocks
Message-ID: <DB6PR10MB183228F27750132F9A6A3542A6690@DB6PR10MB1832.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Greetings,

What do you think about implementing Confidential Transactions in extension blocks? CT transactions go from extension block to extension block passing through normal blocks. It looks the perfect solution:

- Soft fork: old nodes see CT transactions as "sendtoany" transactions
- Safe: if there is a software bug in CT it's impossible to create new coins because the coins move from normal block to normal block as public transactions
- Legal: Exchanges can use public transactions so regulators can monitor their activity
- Capacity increase: the CT signature is stored in the extension block, so CT transactions increase the maximum number of transactions per block

Regards
