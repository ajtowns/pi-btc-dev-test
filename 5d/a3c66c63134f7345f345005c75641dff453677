Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Password-protected private key export
	format and version bytes

Hello all,

The description of the password-protected export format has been revised
slightly, and now includes multiple algorithms and a parameter byte for
selecting the encryption parameters.  As before, the thread is here:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=36195.0

Unless there is an existing or other planned use for data class 32, or
another specific objection, I would like to use it for
password-protected private keys.  Going by Sipa's description, this
would mean that a password-protected private key for bitcoin is type 32,
and for the testnet, type 79.

Thanks,
-Sam Revitch
