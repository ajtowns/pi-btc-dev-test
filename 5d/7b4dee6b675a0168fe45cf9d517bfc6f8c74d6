Can you tell me where it is enforced?

The only place I found was here;
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L1793

which doesn?t enforce it, all that code does is check that the txid is 
unknown or fully spent.
And since the below idea from Russel would change the txid, it would seem no 
full client would reject this.

Maybe its in a BIP, but I can?t find it in the code.
