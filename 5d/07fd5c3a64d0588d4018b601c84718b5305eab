Quite agreed.  Also, transactions with unconfirmed inputs should be 
among the first to get dropped, as discussed in the "Dropped-transaction 
spam" thread.  Like all policy rules, either of these works in 
proportion to its deployment.

Be advised that pull request #6068 emphasizes the view that the network 
will never have consistent mempool/relay policies, and on the contrary 
needs a framework that supports and encourages pluggable, generally 
parameterized policies that could (some might say should) conflict 
wildly with each other.

It probably doesn't matter that much.  Deploying a new policy still 
wouldn't be much easier than deploying a patched version.  I mean, 
nobody has proposed a policy rule engine yet (oops).
