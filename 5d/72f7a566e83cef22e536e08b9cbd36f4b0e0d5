The alert system requires a signature verification when it receives an
alert, but so do blocks and transactions so it really isn't a DoS target
(remember that the alert system requires alerts to be signed by a key
that only gavin and satoshi have).

The alert system could prove very, very valuable.  In much software it
carries the risk for abuse or simply seems wrong that the developers can
send a message to everyone's computer to notify them of something, but
keep in mind that Bitcoin is financial software.  If there is an urgent
problem (like the overflow bug) there must be a way to notify people to
upgrade immediately, which is exactly what alerts provide.  Since alerts
no longer carry the ability to put Bitcoin into RPC safe-mode, they are
literally just a message and I see no reason why they should be removed.
