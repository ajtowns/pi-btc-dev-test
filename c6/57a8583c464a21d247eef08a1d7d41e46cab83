Subject: [bitcoin-dev] General bitcoin users mailing list?
Message-ID: <bdcfa3a2-50f0-08ea-dc69-2432cd3547e0@cannon-ciota.info>

I understand this mailing list is for topics relating to development. Is
there a general users mailing list for bitcoin related things such as
questions that are not necessarily related to dev?
