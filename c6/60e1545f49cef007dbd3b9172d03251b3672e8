This diverges from the topic but seems like a good idea to me in
general, not so much as replacement for jgarzik's proposal.

Something like `getutxos` or this proposal could be implemented as an
external application or script, instead of having to integrate
everything into bitcoind.

Bitcoind would need a local interprocess message bus for that, and
would need to act as router for messages from/to the P2P network.
ZeroMQ seems like a good choice for that. That's not completely crazy
as there are already plans to add zeromq as an optional dependency for
notifications [1].
