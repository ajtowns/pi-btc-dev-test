Yes.  This was stated in the original email.

At current rates it is potentially years before that point is reached
-- years of degraded service for existing users.

If you see a rule change, you have misunderstood the proposal.

This is an -implementation- change, which users and miners are free to
accept or reject as part of their choice of software to use in the
bitcoin ecosystem.

As such, miners continue to be free to build upon empty blocks, and
let those blocks become part of a useful chain.  You would not simply
/ban/ empty blocks completely, but avoid relaying top-of-chain empty
blocks.

Mining power and network collaborate to choose the best chain at that
point -- perhaps even including those empty blocks.  Clients will
continue to follow the longest, strongest chain, even after this
implementation change.

An implementation change is a soft vote of choice by the user, not a
hard requirement on all users.

See above -- such behavior is perfectly fine.

It should be noted that out of band (OOB) TXs, transited through third
party means outside P2P network, would not cause _empty_ blocks, as
the block chain will continue to have traffic for the foreseeable
future.

OOB TXs are a great idea, too.  In a hyperscaled bitcoin future, OOB
TXs might even be the norm.
