Oops, right. That memory usage is bounded right now by bounds on the
memory pool size, though, right? (I'm being lazy and not digging into
that code)

What is the worst-case for an attacker interested in trying to get you
to saturate your upstream bandwidth or use lots of memory?  Set a
bloom filter that matches everything, and then start requesting old
blocks in the chain? It would be nice if the worst-case was no worse
than the worst-case we've got now (... requesting full, old
blocks...).
