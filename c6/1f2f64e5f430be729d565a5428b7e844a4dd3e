The Coldcard hardware wallet is PSBT native and does work directly from PSBT.

For the Coldcard, we expect a PSBT to be 'uploaded' over USB (can
also be provided on MicroSD card) and we work in-place with it,
scanning over it a few different times. If the user approves the
transaction, we produce a signed PSBT or final transaction and that
gets downloaded.

We support 256k byte PSBT files with hundreds of inputs/outputs
(IIRC, and exact limits still TBD) and are operating in a system
with only 25k free RAM after startup.

+1 for mimetype, especially since it's a binary format.
