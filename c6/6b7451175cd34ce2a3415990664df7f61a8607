Hi folks,

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev
The move is now complete.  The previous archive has been fully imported and
new posts here will now be saved.

*Greylisting Notice*
Your first post to this list may be delayed by 5+ minutes due to Greylisting
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting>. Subsequent posts should go
through without delay. Contact Freenode #bitcoin-dev if you have any
questions or concerns.

*TODO*

   - LF will be upgrading Mailman soon to better handle posts from DKIM
   enforced domains.
   - There will be a few more config tweaks like auto-rejecting
   non-subscribed posts.  Nobody has time to moderate this list, and mail
   silently disappearing into the moderation hold blackhole is worse than an
   instant reject message telling people to subscribe.   Unfortunately, it is
   too dangerous to auto-reject spam ... those messages need to go into a
   blackhole to prevent bounce abuse.
