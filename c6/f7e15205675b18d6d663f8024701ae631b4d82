Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Proposal: Rate Limiting with server specified
	Proof of Work challenges
Message-ID: <CALJw2w7CBFU-xFnar6p4k+84Umh5rsuaQ6UA1-8E2_N3_AOSpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am proposing a new feature for rate limiting purposes where nodes
can make and solve arbitrary PoW challenges in return for connection
slots (to be expanded to cover e.g. bloom filters or other DoS risky
services).

The BIP currently includes two proofs of work (sha256 and
cuckoo-cycle) which can be combined (e.g. sha256(cuckoo-cycle) or
sha256(sha256(sha256)), etc).

Feedback welcome.
