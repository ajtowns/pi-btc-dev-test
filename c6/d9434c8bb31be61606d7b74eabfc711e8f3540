These recent edits definitely guide us towards less hard feelings when
comments are offered, without excessive policy structure.

Is this mix of wiki and mailing list intentional?  If so, the wiki
talk page is meant to be a self-curated permanent record of support
and dissent, but second-order reply commentary might fall either on
the wiki or the mailing list?

Mediawiki offers watchlists on a polling model, and there is some
email support [1], but it would be nice of a BIP author to at least
gather new/edited comment titles and report them to bitcoin-dev once a
week, during review.  Someone has to stare at the diffs.

BIP 2 should ask that all current and future forums that BIP authors
might choose for review have indisputable records of moderation and
user edits.

Is dump.bitcoin.it a sufficient public record of contentious
moderation or user cross-comment editing?  It seems like as long as
the wiki as a whole is verifiable, it would suffice.
