Like I said before, that leads to the obvious next step of
deleting/stealing their coinbases if they don't identify themselves.

Another likely outcome would be for coinbase blacklisting to be used as
a way to force a minority of miners to adopt a transaction blacklist
that the majority of miners had adopted. Any block containing
transactions spending coins on the txout blacklist would itself be
punished by having the block reward either blacklisted or taken.

It's not possible to produce a cryptographic proof that a given block
engaged in a Finney attack. You're proposed coinbase blacklisting/reallocation
mechanism is simply a way of voting on what coinbases to either
blacklist or reallocation, nothing more.
