OK, fair enough, just wanted to make sure we were on the same page.
"Thorny issues there and there hasn't been a ton of effort put into what
Bitcoin integration and maintainability looks like" is a perfectly fair

Or use curve-agnostic jets to do Weil pairing validation. Or string manipulation and serialization jets to implement covenants. So I don?t think the situation is as dire as you make it sound.
