You just disproved your own argument.

It is possible to predict risk, and therefore to price the risk.

You also noted that for some Bitcoin users, the price of that risk is
too high for the types of transactions in which wish to engage.

In what way does that translated into a universal requirement for
everybody to use multisignature notaries?

Surely the users who can afford the risk can use zero conf if they
like, and those who can't can use multisig notaries?
