You make some good points.  However, I still hope for standardization by
"profile".  E.g. a "consumer profile" for wallets with just one account,
a "business profile" for small business wallets.  If an application
falls outside of the standardized profiles, they can roll their own or
try to promote a new standard.

I think there are some important advantages to not being forced to use
the old wallet to send coins when switching wallets. The three I can
think of right now are: maintaining transaction history, emergency
transition when a wallet has a serious (e.g. money losing) bug and web
wallet with server down.

Another important reason to standardize is to reduce the "roll your own
crypto" temptation on the wallet creator part, where the wallet-specific
algorithm is more likely to contain weaknesses.

I do agree that trying to come up with one uber standard will likely
fail and is probably counter productive.
