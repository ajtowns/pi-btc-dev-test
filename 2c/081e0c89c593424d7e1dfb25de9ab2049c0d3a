We have a fundamental disagreement here.

If you go back and read Satoshi's original thoughts on scaling, it is clear
that he imagined tens of thousands of mining nodes and hundreds of millions
of lightweight SPV users.

Scaling is a problem if every person is a fully validating node; then,
indeed, you get an O(n^2) problem.  Which can be solved by extending some
tentative trust to your peers, but lets put all those possible solutions
aside.

Given tens of thousands of fully validating nodes, you get O(m*n), where m
is the number of fully validating peers and is a large constant (10s of
thousands).

We don't know how large m can or will be; we have only just started to
scale up.

"Bitcoin doesn't scale" is pure FUD. It might not scale in exactly the way
you want, but it WILL scale.
