Chrome has whitelisted bitcoin: URIs for web apps, and Firefox it turns out
doesn't use whitelisting at all, so it already works there.

I'm hoping this means web wallet developers won't be put off from
supporting the payment protocol (that risk is the reason I started this
work).

The next step is to file bugs against WebKit (for Safari/iOS/misc other
platforms), and IE, though I don't know if Microsoft uses open bug trackers
much.
