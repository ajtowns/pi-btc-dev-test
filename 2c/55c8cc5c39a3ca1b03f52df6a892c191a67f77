Subject: [bitcoin-dev] SLIP-0039: Shamir's Secret-Sharing for Mnemonic Codes
Message-ID: <4e2c7b41-1e16-b89a-04d8-776f3469141a@satoshilabs.com>

Hello everyone,

We are currently writing a new specification for splitting BIP-32 master
seeds into multiple mnemonics using Shamir's secret sharing scheme. We
would be interested in getting your feedback with regard to the
high-level design of the new spec:
https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md
Please focus your attention on the section entitled "Master secret
derivation functions", which proposes several different solutions. Note
that there is a Design Rationale section at the very end of the
document, which should answer some of the questions you may have. The
document is a work in progress and we are aware that some technical
details have not been fully specified. These will be completed once the
high level design has been settled.

Thanks,

Andrew Kozlik
