I also agree we shouldn't limit specs to Apple product capabilities. If
history is any indication, NFC will be opened up to developers in iOS 9,
just like touch id in was in iOS 8, and bluetooth LE in iOS 5, one major OS
revision after the hardware capability is first introduced.

Also, I'm pretty sure that Apple doesn't care about bitcoin at all. When
they banned wallets from the app store, it was prior to the 2013 FinCEN
guidance. At the time many of us, myself included, assumed USG would take
the same stance with bitcoin as they did against e-gold. It wasn't clear at
all that bitcoin didn't violate legal tender laws or who knows what. When
Apple allowed wallets back in, it was just weeks before Apple pay launched.
It's seems clear that bitcoin is too small for them to be concerned about
in the slightest.
