If enough miners don't like a block that has been mined, they can all
work to orphan it without any change to the protocol whatsoever.

Why are proposing this a change to the network that allows miners to
vote to disregard output scripts, instead of creating an out of band
network via which miners can coordinate actions using the capabilities
the protocol already allows?

Once you've changed the network such that it is no longer a machine
that faithfully processes scripts, and instead is a machine via which
a set of controllers can decide which valid scripts will be honored
and which ones will not, what will be the next proposed condition
under which the miners can confiscate and redistribute balances?
