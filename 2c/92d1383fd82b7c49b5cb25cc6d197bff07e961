Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin is an experiment. Why don't we have an
 experimental hardfork?

I would expect any uncontroversial hardfork to be deployed in testnet3
before it is deployed in bitcoin's main chain.

In any case, you can already do these tests using
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6382
Note that even if the new testchains are regtest-like (ie cheap proof
of work) you don't need to test them "in-a-box": you can run them from
many different places.
Rusty's test ( http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=509 ) could have been
perfectly made using #6382, it just didn't existed at the time.
