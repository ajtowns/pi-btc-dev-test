This would be a problem if it was used in the merkle tree, but I'm pretty sure 
using it for input selection would be pretty safe. One could even avoid the 
index by simply using the hashScript as the sole input value; then even 
CoinJoins would be safe without breaking chains of transactions (although this 
would break address reuse entirely - but I don't see that as a problem in a 
theoretical world). One of those things that an altcoin could improve upon 
Bitcoin with... ;)
