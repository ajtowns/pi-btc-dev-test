Yes you could for example define a new rule that two signatures
(double-spend) authorises something - eg miners to take funds. (And
this would work with existing ECDSA addresses & unrestricted R-value
choices).

I wasnt really making a point other than an aside that it maybe is
sort-of possible to do with math what you said was not possible where
you said "This [preventing signing more than one message] is
impossible to implement with math alone".
