If people want to influence the decisions of miners, all they need to
do is mine.

I do not see why any person would want to pay, and then trust, another
to mine accordingly. Each person can mine and attain their level of
influence. This not only avoids the side payment, but earns the person
money.

There is nothing inherently wrong with paying people to run nodes or
signal "readiness", but there is no reason whatsoever to consider
these ideas beneficial from a personal/economic or
security/decentralization standpoint.

If you are not running a node you are not part of the economic
consensus. If you are not mining you have no say in transaction
ordering. The "solution" is both obvious and necessary to secure Bitcoin
.

If a person does not want to bother then he/she clearly does not have
a strong opinion. As developers we should be focused on reducing the
complexities of mining and of validation, not finding ways for people
to avoid participating in these necessarily distributed roles.
