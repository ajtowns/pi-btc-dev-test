Almost none of these merchants depend on Bitcoin in any significant way 
for revenue...and that's likely to remain the case for a good while. 
Merchants that have chosen to accept Bitcoin are typically using a 
handful of payment processors, again...chokepoints. And almost none of 
them are contributing any network resources back to Bitcoin.

Exchanges are indeed serious chokepoints. But increasing the number of 
users will probably have relatively little effect on this unless we also 
increase the number of exchanges and decentralize the exchanges. If all 
we had to do is increase the number of users, the same argument could be 
used to claim that banks would be less susceptible to governmental 
crackdowns if they just had more account holders.

Exchange decentralization is indeed another thing we must work towards - 
but that's probably beyond the scope of the more pressing issue which is 
building consensus in Bitcoin development.

I've pointed out this weakness of Bitcoin *numerous* times. That I 
failed to mention it here does not mean it hasn't been discussed 
elsewhere. Some of us have also been actively working towards developing 
a more modular, layered architecture and better implementations that 
will afford greater decentralization in software development with less 
need for critical code reviews, less pushback from downstream developers 
who must continuously rebase, a better process for building consensus in 
the community, and simpler app migration.

We need to increase the basic infrastructure nodes by a factor much 
larger than 2 or 3...more like 100 or 1000...and it's entirely doable 
with properly aligned incentives.
