Bandwidth can be purchased.  Infrastructure to handled increasing 
transaction volume can be purchased.  The very fees being paid by a spammer 
will be used to increase the miners' ability to absorb even more fees.  The 
blocksize limit cannot respond in such a dynamic way to attacks.  Miners 
cannot buy a greater blocksize limit in response to a spammer that is paying 
high fees to deny transaction confirmation to the rest of the planet in an 
attempt to destroy the network.  The blocksize limit is creating an attack 
that can be maintained forever by any organization that can afford to fill 
the blocks.  This attack would get incredibly cheaper once the BTCUSD market 
tanks in response to the lack of usability of the Bitcoin network, meaning 
it would be a self-reinforcing attack that would likely destroy Bitcoin for 
as long as an attacker wants to keep it up, or until you patch it to remove 
the limit after-the-fact, which might be too little too late.

If this isn't fixed, I would expect to see it carried out at some point by 
someone with a large short position in BTCUSD.

Bitcoin is a global consensus system - if you're bandwidth isn't
sufficient to keep up you are not part of the consensus.

The blocksize limit *is* what determines the minimum bandwidth required
to stay in consensus.

Again, in your scenario if the bandwidth consumed by those transactions
was sufficiently high, the network would collapse because consensus
would fail.

Why wouldn't that bandwidth be high enough to cause that collapse?
Because of the blocksize limit! (combined with an intelligent mempool
that increases the minimum fee/KB appropriately - we don't have that
yet)

I already did the math for you on that: the maximum transaction fee
you'd see in that kind of attack is around $2.5 USD/tx. That definitely
is not high enough to make Bitcoin non-viable - I personally could
easily afford fees like that for about 90% of my transactions this year
by value, as I mainly use Bitcoin to get paid by my clients around the
world. In fact, just today O'Reilly paid $15 USD to send me a wire
transfer for expenses related to a conference I was invited too.

A much more realistic transaction flood scenario - one that didn't raise
serious questions about whether or not the attacker could afford to 51%
attack Bitcoin - would raise tx fees to something more like $0.25/tx
