Newspapers are often sold in vending machines that make it possible for anyone to just pay the price of one and take them all?and most of the time they are not that carefully monitored. Why? Because most people have better things to do than try to steal a few newspapers. They probably were much more closely monitored earlier in their history?but once it became clear that despite the obvious attack vector very few people actually try to game it, vendors figured it wasn?t really that big a risk. Same thing applies to people trying to steal a piece of bubble gum at the cash register at a convenience store by double-spending.
