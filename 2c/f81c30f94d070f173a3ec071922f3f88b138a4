Do you think it would be useful to have an inverted version of both CSV and CLTV? To verify if an output is spent before a specific time. CLTV and CSV could be implemented by taking two stack arguments, an integer for the comparison and TRUE/FALSE. 

Now that I think about this more, the problem is that, for example, just having a lock time of less than some value doesn't actually mean it has to be spent before that script value, so this might not work. Likely any implementations of such a feature would have to provide the script execution environment with access to information that it doesn't have now, which is what we are trying to avoid. 

Best,
Stephen

What is interesting about this architecture is that it possible to cleanly separate the relative lock-time (sequence numbers) from the RCLTV opcode (OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) both in concept and in implementation. Like CLTV, the CSV opcode only checks transaction data and requires no contextual knowledge about block headers, a weakness of the other RCLTV proposals that violate the clean separation between libscript and libconsensus. In a similar way, this BIP proposal only touches the transaction validation logic without any impact to script.

So, while your solution would probably work in cases like this, where multiple signing parties are involved, there may be other, seen or unforeseen, use cases that require putting the relative locktime right into the spending contract (the scriptPubKey itself). When there is only one signer, there's nothing that enforces using an nSequence and nVersion=2 that would prevent spending the output until a certain time.

The benefits are obviously that it saves transaction space by repurposing unused space, and would likely work for most cases where an OP_RCLTV would be needed.

The latter point has been partially addressed by having the relative lock-time semantics be enforced only if the most-significant bit of nSequence is set. This preserves 31 bits for alternative use when relative lock-times are not required.
