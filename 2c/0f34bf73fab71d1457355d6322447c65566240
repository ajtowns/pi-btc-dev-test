If our rule change timing is different from changes on the chain with
most work, then (extending Johnson Lau's terminology a bit) we may
experience subjective hardfork-ness; due to miners creating blocks
which the economic majority goes on to accept, though they have a less
restrictive ruleset than ours.

Correct for the segwit soft fork, which is narrowing the definition
of a nonstandard transaction.  It's safe to say that if a block with a
tx violating cleanstack were to occur on a non-segwit chain, that it
was for malicious reasons.

However, some future forks - that a full node experiences as
low subjective hardfork-ness (i.e. soft forks) - might restrict
more common things.

Sure, a nice-to-have would be a SetfLargeWorkInvalidChainFound() that
was aware as well, though clients can make these decisions themselves.
