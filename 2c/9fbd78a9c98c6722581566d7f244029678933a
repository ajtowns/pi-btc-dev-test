This is the sort of thing I expect to emerge from the places that use
Bitcoin "on the street." We should be watching how local wallet software
displays bitcoin amounts, letting the standards write themselves over time.
The units debate (bits, millibits, etc) has been going on nearly as long as
I've known about Bitcoin and yet most tools display standard bitcoin
amounts (1 unit = 1e8 satoshi).
