BitPay experimented with QR codes in low light, restaurant and other
conditions.  QR codes become difficult to use even at 100 chars.

On the merchant side, we prefer a short URL that speaks payment
protocol if visited via bitcoin client, but will gracefully work if
scanned by a phone with zero bitcoin support -- you will simply be
redirected to a BitPay invoice page for a normal browser.
