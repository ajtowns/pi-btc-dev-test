Hi ZmnSCPxj

I dont think they need to be ENFORCED to be worth the same.
If the two chains? algorithms are the same , except some identifiers (eg.
btc.0 btc.1?, they have no reason to have different value. If so, the
market will adjust the value.

Also, the total supply can be the same. The amount in blockchains  is just
some numbers. The  wallet can display correct amount, according to the
identifiers.

The voluntary split is also backward compatible with old version
transactions, they can be treated as tx for both chains and included in
both chains later. For new version Tx after fork, some identifiers must be
added , to mark the tx is for that chain only. The miners need to choose
one chain to mine.

After several voluntary splits , the Blockchain basically become a
blocktree, new blocks are added to the leaves(eg. btc.00 btc.01 btc.10
btc.11 ), providing even more capacity.
