There are two problems with this statement.  Firstly we can not be doing
protocol design via political lobbying - this is not a scientific approach
and for sure leads to disaster; it is not the colour of the paint on the box,
it is the security of the system.

Secondly as I understand it the Chinese miners did this under duress
of threats of worse as a compromise beyond what they felt they could safely
cope with.
