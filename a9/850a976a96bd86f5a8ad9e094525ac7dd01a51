In England under RIPA 2000 legislation, it's irrelevant whether you have
the data or not. If the authorities compel you to hand over that
information, and it is within your means to obtain it then you are
obliged to do so under threat of criminal offense.

So any mechanism whereby data could be collected from Bitcoin users,
whether it's stored ephemerally or not, if the police have reasonable
suspicion to think it exists then they can compel all parties to work to
get them the data they require.

If the mechanism flat out does not exist, that is miles better than
could exist. Deniability is not a defense when served with a police
notice for disclosing data.

You have to think not only about the end result, but also about how
these mechanisms can be used for intimidating users or leveraging
technologies.
