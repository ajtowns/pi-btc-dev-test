Please cut it out with the snake oil pedaling. This is really over the
top. You're invoking the NSA as the threat here? Okay. The NSA can
trivially compromise an HTTPS download site: even ignoring the CA
insecurity, and government run CAs certificate authorities issue CA
certs to random governments and corporations for dataloss prevention
purposes. Not to mention unparalleled access to exploits.

The downloads are protected by something far stronger than SSL
already, which might even have a chance against the NSA. Actual
signatures of the downloads with offline keys.

I'm all pro-SSL and all that, but you are? piece by piece? really
convincing me that it produces an entirely false sense of security
which is entirely unjustified.
