Sorry for hijacking the thread again

(I think this case if not completely unrealistic):

What would happen, if a user gave out 21 addresses, then address0 had
receive funds in +180 days after generation where address21 had receive
funds immediately (all other addresses never received a tx).

In a scan, address0 would be detected at <address-birthday>+180 days
which would trigger the resize+20 of the address-lookup-window, but, we
would require to go back 180day in order to detect received transaction
of address21 (new lookup-window) in that case.

Or do I misunderstand something?
