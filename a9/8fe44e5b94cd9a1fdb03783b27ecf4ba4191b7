Just a quick comment on the actual fees (checked at blockchain.info) the
average fee over the last 90 days is actually ~0.0003BTC/txn - so not
too far behind the theoretical minimum of 0.00037BTC/txn.

I suppose, though, that it has more to do with old clients and fee
settings (0.0005) than network wisdom ;)
