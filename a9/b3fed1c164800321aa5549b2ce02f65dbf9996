Please, this has drifted so far from the goal of this list: bitcoin development, and technical and academic debate about that.

Meta-discussion of communities has no place here.

I'd say: in the spirit of permissionlessness, everyone can create a community or list about bitcoin. If you don't agree with the admin, create your own. That's more constructive use of everyone's time and energy than trying to pressure people to change their behavior on their own home turf.
