That is an interesting point.  That is a feature of Bitcoin, not a bug. 
  If the user did have rights to sue someone then the system would not 
be decentralized.  User rights = someone else has a liability for 
violating those rights.

As it is now a user would have the right to sue all the miners, node 
operators, and developers collectively.  Of course that is not realistic 
which is the way a decentralized system should be.  If you want to try 
to define specific entities that have liability then they must be in 
control or otherwise they would not be liable.
