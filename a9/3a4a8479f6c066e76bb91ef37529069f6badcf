Because it takes time to put the files up, propagate to mirrors, check
by multiple people that the downloads work an the signatures pass.

Every release comes with a release announcement, you'll know its out
when you see the release announcement.

The alternative is that announcements go out and the files are not
correct, or hide the files in the release pipeline and allow less
public participation in the release workflow. I think that would be
unfortunate.
