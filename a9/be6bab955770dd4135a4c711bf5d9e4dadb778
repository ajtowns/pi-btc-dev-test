I don't have the time to use the code to write tests and simulations
myself right now but I would be really happy about someone else doing
it.
Even though they share the same port and magic numbers, each of the N
testchains in #6382 has a different genesis block, so they will reject
blocks from any other testchain from the start.
But you will likely connect the nodes directly and manually to get the
network topology you want to test anyway.
I hope this answers your questions but I'm happy to answer any other
questions you may have.
