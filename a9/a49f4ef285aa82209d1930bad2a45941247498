Ah, then my mistake. It seemed so similar to an idea that was proposed
before on this mailing list:

http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/008033.html

that my mind just filled in the gaps. I concur -- having miners -- or any
group -- vote on block size is not an intrinsically good thing. The the
original proposal due to Greg Maxwell et al was not a mechanism for
"voting" but rather a feedback control that made the maximum block size
that which generated the most fees.
