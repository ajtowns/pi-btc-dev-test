Binary formats can be challenging to deal with and convert to other
formats.  The experiences in the PKI world of ASN.1 have not been great, in
terms of interop.  It tends to create islands and silos.  This is probably
one of the reasons why X.509 and GPG are fragmented and why we dont really
have a widely deployed web of trust on the net.  Another reason is simply
lack of developer resources to make tools.  In that respect I think JSON
offers significant advantages, though I am interested in the security
issues raised.
