I expect it would be especially since operations must be implemented
in sidechannel resistant manners.

Also, binary extension fields are doing to have linear subgroup
properties where leaking part of elements wouldn't be good. Not as
obviously broken as the example I gave above, but still in the domain
of "get chunks of a lot of a supra threshold set of shares, and setup
a latices basis problem that can provide an efficient subspace to
search".
