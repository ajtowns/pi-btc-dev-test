That's true. It can be perhaps be represented as "I keep the last N blocks"
and then most likely for any given node the policy doesn't change all that
fast, so if you know the best chain height you can calculate which nodes
have what.

Well, old nodes would ignore it and new nodes wouldn't need it?

Maybe so, with a "last N blocks" in addr messages though such nodes could
just set their advertised history to zero and not have to deal with serving
blocks to nodes.

If you have a node that serves the chain but doesn't validate it, how does
it know what the best chain is? Just whatever the hardest is?
