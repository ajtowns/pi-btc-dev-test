I know the idea is not new. Just bringing it up to emphasize that if we don?t use it how could we expect other networks using it.
Machine to machine micro payments could become the killer application for Bitcoin.

1) There is no catch 22 as there are plenty of ways getting bitcoin without bootstrapping a full node.

2) let markets work out and not speculate what would happen.

3) Serving archive bolcks does not have to be part of core but could be a distinct service written in a language of your choice using new protocol.

As mentioned earlier I am for a stripped down core that does nothing else than consensus and stores nothing else needed for that task and offering SPV api to the wallets.
