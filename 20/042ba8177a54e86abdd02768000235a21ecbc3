Assuming AsicBoost miners are in the minority, their chain will constantly
get overtaken. So it will not be one endless hard fork as you claim, but
rather AsicBoost blocks will continue to be ignored (orphaned) until they
stop making them.

They will in fact continually "switch over" to the majority, they just are
unable to extend that majority chain themselves.
