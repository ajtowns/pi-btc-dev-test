That would have the unfortunate effect of incentivizing miners to not
completely fill blocks, because low fee marginal transactions could cost
them money.

An alternate approach would be to incentivize miners to follow transaction
fees more by reducing mining rewards, which could be done by soft forking
in a requirement that a chunk of all mining rewards be sent to an
unspendable address.
