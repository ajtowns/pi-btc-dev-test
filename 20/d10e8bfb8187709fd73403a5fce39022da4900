I'm not sure if I can make sense of your email.

Ignoring the rest, I don't think that the physical location /
jurisdiction of the miner has any legal implications for law applicable
to the relationship between sender and receiver of a payment. 

This is not particular to Bitcoin. We're both in Germany (I guess).
Assume we have a contract without specific agreements and I pay you in
Icelandic kronur via PayPal (in Luxembourg) and my HTTPS requests to
PayPal went via Australia and the US. Then German law applies to our
contract, nothing in the middle can change that.

Also ignoring possible security implications, there is just no need for
a mechanism that enables users to select miners. I claim that almost
nobody cares who will mine a transaction, because it makes no technical
difference. If you don't want a specific miner to mine your
transaction, then don't use Bitcoin.
