Not really. The problem is that you assume a transaction corresponds to a
single payment. This is true for simple wallet use cases, but not
compatible with CoinJoin, or with systems that for example would want to
combine multiple payments in a single transaction.

I owe you an apology here, for judging based on the summary you posted
rather than reading the actual text.

48 bits seems low to me, but it does indeed solve the problem. Why not 128
or 256 bits?

I think that is a mistake. You should not assume that the wallet who held
the coins is the payer/buyer. That's what I said earlier; you're implicitly
creating an identity (the one who holds these keys) based on the
transaction. This seems fundamentally wrong to me, and not necessary. The
receiver should not care who paid or how, he should care what was payed for.

The easiest solution to this IMHO would be an extension to the payment
protocol that gives you (or your wallet) a token in return for paying, and
that knowledge of that token is used to gain access to the services you
provide.
