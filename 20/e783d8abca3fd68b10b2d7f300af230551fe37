Can we add Bitcoin Wallet? I'm not very good at writing descriptions, so
I would just add this for starters:

--
Bitcoin Wallet is a standalone wallet for Android devices. Its primary
focus is ease of use and being independant of central network components
(servers). It supports initiating transactions via QR code,  Bitcoin
URIs or near-field communication (NFC). It has a useful currency
conversion calculator.

Platforms: Android
Market: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet
