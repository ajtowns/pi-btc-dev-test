No, not changing the protocol.

Further, adding a field to TX would imply the client needed to rewrite
the TX for each retransmit, changing the hash.  Not good at all.

Typically no, because 99.9% of TX's make it throughout the network in
seconds.  But yes it is possible, just like it is possible today to
receive a TX at various times.
