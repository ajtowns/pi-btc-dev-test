I am curious if the Android developer who had been working on two factor
authentication and bitcoin had worked toward an open issue or pull
request?  I had been looking around for some sign that this had occurred
but hadn't found it, I am interested to know what is the progress in this
area (in a fully decentralized way that resides fully on one's device or
devices).

For some reason maidsafe keeps rising up in my brain, have bitcoin core
developers touched bases with maidsafe developers on these kind of fine
points?

Just thoughts and questions.
