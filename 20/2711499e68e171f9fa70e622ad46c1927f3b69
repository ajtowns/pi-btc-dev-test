Subject: [Bitcoin-development] python-bitcoinlib: Comprehensive bitcoin
	library for python
Message-ID: <CA+8xBpcu6dEdvWNGS+rhCQsDfHh5eOD=nFi+6BFO0Coi0toRUw@mail.gmail.com>

GitHub URL: https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinlib
Repository: git://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinlib.git

The python library for pynode has matured sufficiently to have a home
of its own.  The python-bitcoinlib project attempts to present a
lightweight, modular, a la carte interface to bitcoin data structures
and network protocols.

Features:

 *   Easy object interface to all bitcoin core data structures: block,
transaction, addresses, ...
 *   Full transaction script engine
 *   Fully verifies main and testnet block chains (via pynode)
 *   ECDSA verification (OpenSSL wrapper)
 *   Object interface to all known network messages
 *   Binary encoding/decoding (serialization) for full bitcoin
protocol interoperability
 *   Passes many of the tests shipped with the bitcoin reference
client (bitcoind/Bitcoin-Qt)

Like pynode, this library is currently a developer-only release, not
recommended for highly secure production sites.

Pull requests, comments, questions and donations always welcome.
