There's no difference, the -timedtest mode does exactly that. But
automatically instead of having to manually ask for a new block every
second.
I assume your position is that the difference is too small to justify
a new mode, or that you just don't see any value in it.

The -private mode, on the other hand, would allow you to simulate
proof of work attacks as described in the previous post, but maybe
there's a simpler way to do the same solely using regtest/timedtest.

Maybe I should have asked the following questions before proposing anything:

1) How does someone simulate a pow race situation without doing any
pow right now?
Does anybody try these things? How?

2) If I wanted to measure validation performance, to get the number of
peak tps that could be processed without taking block sides or network
latency into account, how would I do that? Has anybody tried this
before?
