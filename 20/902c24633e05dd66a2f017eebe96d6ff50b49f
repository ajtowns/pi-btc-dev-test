Thank you for clearing this up.  It seems, I misunderstood.  So my earlier rumination, about having two options for Lightning, is incorrect.

For Lightning, we just need to add this 0-value OP_TRUE output always to transactions that require both side signatures (commitment, HTLC-timeout, HTLC-success), and it will always serve as a "hook" for  adding more fees if needed.
