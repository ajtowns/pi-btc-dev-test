My personal opinion is that the ideal first client has three features:

(1) Starts up and is usable within a couple minutes (even 10 min the first
time would be okay, to sync block headers)
(2) Supports Windows, Linux and OSX
(3) Uses deterministic wallets that can produce a permanent backup
(preferably paper)

Encryption is a major upside, too, but people new enough to Bitcoin that
they need such a simple client, can survive without encryption (thye're not
going to be holding a ton of coins) -- as long as they are made aware that
they do not currently have encryption, and the associated risks (and other
options).

I think it's extremely important that users have a clear way to backup
their coins to offline media or paper, in such a way that they don't ever
need to worry about it again.  Not only does it give users protection
against hard-drive loss, it means that they may find it again in the far
future when they haven't used Bitcoin in 2 years, and it reminds them that
they still have coins (and they don't have to type in 1000 private keys to
get their coins)

For that reason, I think Multibit is an excellent choice.  I haven't spent
much time with it, but I do understand it to  satisfy (1) and (2) clearly,
and (3) may be happening in the near future (along with encryption).  But I
do wonder if it has enough staffing behind it to be the center of attention
(no offense to jim618, but if this becomes the "de-facto" client for new
users, we should make sure there's a lot of people available to support it
-- what if a major security bug is found?  how long would it take the
current team to identify, fix and test that bug?)
