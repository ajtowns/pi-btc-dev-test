Indeed, actually implementing hfprep proved to be overly complicated.

I like the idea of a time bomb that just shuts down the client after it 
determine it's stale and refuses to start without an explicit override.
That should work no matter what the hardfork is, and gives us a good 
expectation for hardfork timeframes.

I don't like this idea. It leaves the node open to attack from blocks actually 
meeting the criteria. Maybe the absolute minimum as Jeremy suggested.
