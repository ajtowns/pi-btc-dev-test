It should be possible to configure bind as a DNS forwarder.. this can 
be done in a zone context.. then you can forward the different zones to 
different dnsseed daemons running on different non-public IPs or two 
different ports on the same IP (or on one single non-public IP since 
there's really no reason to expose the dnsseed directly daemon at all).
