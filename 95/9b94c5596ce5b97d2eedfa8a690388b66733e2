In addition to the scheme, I found out, that Makwa
(https://www.bolet.org/makwa/), a hashing function which received a
special recognition in the Password Hashing Competition, supports a
delegation. In fact, Makwa is similar to the suggested scheme.

Unfortunately, both schemes have two drawbacks:
  (1) There is no proof that the host computes what he's suppose to do.
  (2) The delegation is far more slower than the normal computation.
According to the Makwa paper
(https://www.bolet.org/makwa/makwa-spec-20150422.pdf) the delegation is
typically 100 to 1000 slower. So I see little advantage in delegating.

I doubt there is a scheme that suits our needs.
