It would only happen if a large proportion of miners are false-signalling, like how BU did with BIP109 and forked your Classic away on testnet

But this is a egg-and-chicken problem and extending the grace period would not have any improvement. Until the rules are fully activated, it is totally impossible to tell if some miners are false signalling. The only method to prevent it, as usual, is the majority of miners will orphan the blocks of malicious miners. Like in the last year, some miners did not correctly implement BIP66 and got punished by losing many blocks.

If your are suggesting >51% of miners may false-signal (like in the BIP109 case), we already have a much bigger problem.

If people are really worrying about that, I would advise them not to use segwit extensively at the beginning, and wait for at least a week to see any sign of false signalling (which will be shown as invalid orphaned blocks). If the grace period was 2 weeks, they need to wait for 3 weeks; if the grace period was 2 months, they need to wait for 2 months and a week. Pre-activation consensus-imposed grace period could never replace post-activation self-imposed observation period
