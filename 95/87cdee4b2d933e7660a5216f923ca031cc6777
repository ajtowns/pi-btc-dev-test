Agreed. Please don't roll your own onion network. It is very non-trivial to
get security and anonymity to an acceptable level. Securing cryptocurrency
itself is a big enough challenge already.

Another reason it is better to use Tor is because of the mixing effect. A
bitcoin-specific onion network would be subject to easy traffic analysis if
it only carries Bitcoin messages.

Yes, good idea. I've thought about making a "bitcoin tor bundle", analogous
to the firefox Tor bundle that is available from the Tor site itself.

Probably would need to package the block chain with it, as downloading that
over Tor takes ages and causes unnecessary load on the network...
