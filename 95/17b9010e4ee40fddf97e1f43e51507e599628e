I see this use case.
But I did receive bank wire transfers for the last decades without _immediately_ knowing that someone sent funds to me.
I personally would ALWAYS trade the higher bandwidth consumption (300MB mempool filtering) or slower notification time (maybe ~1h) for preserving privacy.
I agree, there are use cases where you want immediate notification, those use cases could probably be solved by not trowing away privacy (?parsing? all transactions and running in the background).
