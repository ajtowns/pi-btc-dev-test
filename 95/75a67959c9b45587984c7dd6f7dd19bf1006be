Subject: [Bitcoin-development] upnp isnt working

hey,

so sipa/gmaxwell proposed on irc that maybe upnp is not working anymore but there isnt any way to test.

well i made an alternate chain, and ran the daemon on my vps.

sometimes it accepts connections, sometimes not. It's all very patchy.

anyway just putting this out there
