I would like to understand why this happens at BitPay? If this is
because people use cut and paste to copy the address and then type the
amount by hand... well this kind of usage will go away.

A program (like an app) should be capable of paying the exact amount. If
not, that's a bug of the app not the protocol.

Sounds interesting, let us know as soon as you have anything.

In which case does it make sense to duplicate the root cert? I'm asking
because it should already be present in the trusted root store, right?

Maybe can you tell about which measures you needed to take to get X.509
working? To me it felt there very several problems.

TLS? We're not using that for pki_data -- its just a byte array.
