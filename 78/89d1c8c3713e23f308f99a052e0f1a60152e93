Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Single signature for all transactions in a block?

I had a question relating to scaling and privacy enhancements.
I believe that segwit combined with aggregated signatures
and coinjoin can potentially achieve such. The idea is to
use aggregated signatures in conjunction with coinjoin. So
that all inputs of a coinjoin transaction would have a single
signature vastly decreasing size while having privacy at the
same time. If majority of transactions in a block did this I
assume that significant more transactions could be fit into a
block? However the question I have, with the extra blockspace
made possible by segwit, is this extra blockspace limited to only
witness data or can it be used for transaction data such as the
scenario I have described here?
