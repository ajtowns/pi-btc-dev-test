Maybe I'm overlooking something, but I've been watching this thread with increasing skepticism at the complexity of the offered solution. I don't understand why it needs to be so complex. I'd like to offer an alternative for your consideration...

Challenge:
"Send me: SHA256(SHA256(concatenation of N pseudo-randomly selected bytes from the block chain))."

Choose N such that it would be infeasible for the responding node to fetch all of the needed blocks in a short amount of time. In other words, assume that a node can seek to a given byte in a block stored on local disk much faster than it can download the entire block from a remote peer. This is almost certainly a safe assumption.

For example, choose N = 1024. Then the proving node needs to perform 1024 random reads from local disk. On spinning media, this is likely to take somewhere on the order of 15 seconds. Assuming blocks are averaging 500 KiB each, then 1024 blocks would comprise 500 MiB of data. Can 500 MiB be downloaded in 15 seconds? This data transfer rate is 280 Mbps. Almost certainly not possible. And if it is, just increase N. The challenge also becomes more difficult as average block size increases.

This challenge-response protocol relies on the lack of a "partial getdata" command in the Bitcoin protocol: a node cannot ask for only part of a block; it must ask for an entire block. Furthermore, nodes could ban other nodes for making too many random requests for blocks.
