Excellent idea, that gets the incentives right.

RE: fixing the root cause with a forking change:

What do other people think?  I think it is too high risk for too
little benefit and shouldn't be done until we have a really compelling
reason to introduce a forking change.

The first really compelling reason I can think of is removing the
MAX_BLOCK_SIZE limit (but does something clever to prevent the
rogue-miner-sends-you-a-valid-10Terabyte-block attack).
