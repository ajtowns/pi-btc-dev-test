This is a reasonable vision, but I think we can do better. We can easily
achieve the goal of letting hobbyists with very limited resources and
connectivity run full nodes. The way to do this is to limit growth of the
blockchain, and the right way to do that is to have fees that reflect the
costs of having large numbers of people validating, storing, and serving
transactions.

I think we're all agreed that decentralization is priority #1. It's what
makes bitcoin unique from everything else. So what then is the best way to
have fees reflect the costs? Having a fixed blocksize (fixed production
quotas) is one very disruptive option that would be a significant departure
from what we have today. The way the network today discourages spam and
other low value uses of the blockchain is with minimum relay fees and
transaction selection rules for blocks. This technique is proven, safe, and
can easily be tuned and experimented with. It's also what all bitcoin
software today is designed to work with.
