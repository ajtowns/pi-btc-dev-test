They never will be. You can get a decent rate of success merely by making one 
transaction propagate fast (eg, 1 input, 1 output) and the other slow (eg, 
1000 inputs, 1000 outputs) and choosing your peers carefully. The only reason 
unconfirmed transactions aren't double spent today is because nobody is 
seriously *trying*.
