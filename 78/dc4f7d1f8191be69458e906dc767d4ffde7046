The only two proposals we sent to the mailing list were attached to this
post:


http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/32736455/


The rest of the proposals in that respository, as well as those the fork

https://github.com/Monetas/rfc/tree/master/bips


were never submitted because we decided to use alternative identifiers in
leiu of BIP numbers to serve as the purpose code in the HD path.
