The twitter teenage nonsense from Todd is ridiculous: 
https://twitter.com/playatodd (warning, triggering)

Mike Hearn has mentioned a few times how Todd's habit of creating drama 
on twitter and reddit every time anyone wants to change something in 
Bitcoin in a way he doesn't like is driving away vendors. Openly 
commenting on a female developers cleavage on twitter, as well as 
referring to a female journalist as "naughty" is disgusting. Him 
constantly hitting on women developers in Bitcoin is driving away 
females.
