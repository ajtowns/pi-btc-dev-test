This is great, thanks for doing it. Tip sent your way.

Graphs of how propagation data change over time would also be helpful (as
well as raw data so we can calculate overhead per kilobyte and so on). I
know there are only two days worth of data, but for future, it'd be good.

I think the next part of figuring out why there's such huge disparity is
instrumenting bitcoind to find out where the time goes when relaying a
block.
