This is exactly why I proposed to extend the definition. My initial proposal was extending it to 33 bytes to effectively allow 16*256 new script versions, assuming we will keep using 32 bytes program hash.

If someday 32 bytes hash is deemed to be unsafe, the txid would also be unsafe and a hard fork might be needed. Therefore, I don?t see how a witness program larger than 40 bytes would be useful in any case (as it is more expensive and takes more UTXO space). I think Pieter doesn?t want to make it unnecessarily lenient.
