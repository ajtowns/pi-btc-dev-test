No. The main idea is to protect the consumer against a malicious seller pretending that he has not been paid. Please read the forum.

The bitcoin address that is used to sign URIs will establish the online reputation of the merchant. If a merchant has received a payment and pretends not to have received it, the signed URI will prove him wrong. 

In principle it would be possible to use HTTPS signatures for that purpose, but this is not really the way HTTPS is supposed to work, and it has disadvantages:
- HTTPS is not always available; there are other communication channels.
- A website, even a single page, may contain URIs posted by various merchants; we need to distinguish the identity of the merchant from the identity of the website.
- with signed URIs, a Bitcoin client can easily keep track of the signatures for all the payments it made. if we used the HTTPS signature of the webpage as receipts, then users would need to save them manually. To my knowledge, nobody does that.

yes, that too. see my proposal here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=60828.0;topicseen
