Let me be more concrete in implementation details: 

1) burn transaction sends at least n satoshis to an OP_RETURN h, 
2) h mod m matches the bitcoin block hash mod m, for the block the burn transaction was mined into.
3) The side chain block header hashes to h and also contains the bitcoin block hight.
4) a side chain block releases x new side coins

Since the burn hash does not reveal in advance which side chain it will be used for, the Bitcoin miner can not selectively block burn mining. They will include loosing bets for the Bitcoin fee. Bitcoin miner have no advantage over independent burn miner of the side chain.

Anyone who issues a burn transaction that complies the rules 1-3 has 1/m the chance to win the next block on the side chain. This implies a fair exchange rate of n*m satoshis = x side coins (at the margin).

Should two burn transactions fulfill the mod m lottery criteria, then we have a competing fork on the side chain. Just as for Bitcoin, the next block(s) will pick the winner. 

To contain fork rate, the parameter m would have to be adjusted dynamically, similar to Bitcoins difficulty. It needs to increase if fork rate increases and decrease if no valid block is burned with Bitcoin blocks. Unfortunately SPV can only prove the existence of a transaction, but not the non-existence of an alternative. Therefore the fork rate within a block cycle can not be evaluated with SPV proofs. 

Rational burn miner who frequently faces and loses head-to-head runs with a competing forks would increase his bet for the next burn cycle, as increasing the individual bet amount has the advantage that if he wins his victory is more stable. Remember the side chain trunk is selected as the one with highest cumulative burn.

Consequently cumulative burn within an adjustment period (measured in Bitcoin blocks) is expected to rise in face of high fork rate. If the sample period burn exceeds a target, then it would trigger a rise to the lottery criteria m, reducing the fork rate and vs.

With Bitcoin we now have a scarce resource within the digital realm, so it appeals my intuition to re-use it for sacrifice instead of linking again an external, real world resource.

To also introduce a lottery, the burn transaction?s hash is required to satisfy some function of the block hash it was included in on the Bitcoin block chain. For example modulo m of the burn transaction hash must match modulo m of the block hash, that is not known in advance.

Should he burn transaction be included into the Bitcoin block chain and the Bitcoin block?s hash satisfy the lottery criteria, then the block candidate can be submitted to extend the side chain.

Bitcoin miner can not selectively block side chains since the hashes associated with the burn do not disclose which side chain or other project they are for. Here you have a ?merged mining? that does not need Bitcoin miner support or even consent.
