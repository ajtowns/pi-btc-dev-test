When a transaction's input value exceeds its output value, the
remainder is the transaction fee.  The miner's reward for processing
transactions is the 25 BTC initial currency distribution + the sum of
all per-transaction fees.  A destroy-by-miner fee transaction is a
normal bitcoin transaction sent by any user, that might look like

Input 1: 1.0 BTC
Output 1: 0.5 BTC

(the miner fee is implicitly 0.5 BTC, paid to whomever mines the
transaction into a block)

Sadly the bitcoin protocol prevents zero-output,
give-it-all-to-the-miner transactions.
