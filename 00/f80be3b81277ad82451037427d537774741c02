That rules out Lightning Network.

Lightning relies on third parties all over the place.  Many things must 
be done right, and on-time by N intermediate third parties (subject to 
business pressures and regulation) or your payment will not work.

Lightning hubs can't steal your money.  Yay!  But banks stealing your 
payment money is not a problem with today's payment systems. Some real 
problems with those systems are:

  - Limited ACCESS to payment systems
  - High FEES
  - Transaction AMOUNT restrictions
  - FRAUD due to weak technology
  - CURRENCY conversions

Plain old bitcoin solves all of these problems.

Bitcoin does have challenges.  THROUGHPUT and TIME-TO-RELIABILITY are 
critical ones.  DECENTRALIZATION and PRIVACY must not be degraded.  
These challenges can be met and exceeded.
