I've done some work in this area. see http://coinvalidation.com/ it's
currently shelved due to lack of legal and regulatory framework.

1. this should not be directly implemented on the protocol level. I believe
its Jeff Garzik who once said "stolen bitcoins is a legal problem, not a
technical one." Legal problems are not technical problems.

2. it is the responsibility of company and individuals to answer questions.
example, stolen bitcoins gets send to address X, and address X is a payment
address of company Y. it is company Y's responsibility to answer to
corresponding agencies responsible. What actions comes out of that is yet
to be determent.

other examples such as, you are using a wallet app, and sending bitcoin
payments to a known malicious address. ( e.g. crypto-locker or other
malware address that replaces the output address.), does the wallet app
warn its users?

Again, while these are not technical problems, they will need answers
eventually. I'll be happy to discuss further off this mailing list as it is
off-topic.
