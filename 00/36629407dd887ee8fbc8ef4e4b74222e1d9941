If 'x' is public, that makes it identifiable and privacy-losing across
inputs.

To avoid "re-use" I suppose you'd want to sign some message like
`HMAC("ownership proof", H(A || x) )` instead. Otherwise any signature you
make using `A` ends up being used as a proof you don't know the input(this
seems like just details but to be more clear)...

To reiterate:

Sign `HMAC("ownership proof", H(A || x) )` using `A`. Public verifiers see
`HMAC("ownership proof", some_random_hash_connected_to_A )` and the HWW
that owns that input can recreate `some_random_hash_connected_to_A` by `H(A
|| x) )`
