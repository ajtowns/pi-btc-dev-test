The disadvantage can be calculated compensated for by higher fees; if
the disadvantage is so large that the higher fees are unaffordable we're
in big trouble as the guarantees that mempools are in sync are pretty
poor. (why doublespending zeroconf txs is easy!) For instance, that'd
imply that sending two simultaneous transactions will cause profit
losses to all but the largest miners - who are unaffected - and that
upgrades that change IsStandard() will cause profit losses, among many
other problems.

Bitcoin just doesn't work if blocks aren't relayed quickly in the worst
case.
