I applaud your brainstorming efforts! :) But I dislike just about
everything about this proposal.

Bitcoin addresses should never be reused, for privacy and security reasons
documented extensively online.

I definitely do not want my computer to maintain a registry of every
address in the world any more than I want to maintain a list of all email
addresses, web addresses, etc. This cannot be scaled and is wasteful since
most participants in the network don't need to transact.

If we need naming conventions, I'd rather see a name registry system
off-chain attached to bip47 reusable payment codes.
