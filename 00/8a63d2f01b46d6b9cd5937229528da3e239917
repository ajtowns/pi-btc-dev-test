Would it be possible to port some of the existing translations?

Well, the strings in the core can be reused one-on-one as the _ function is
mapped to the Qt translation function.

And some of the UI texts probably can be reused as well, at least for a
rough approximation.

The files will have to be converted, as Qt uses an XML-based format whereas
Wx uses a line-based one. Also, Qt translations have a "context"
(file/object) defined whereas in Wx the "msgid" is only the English text.
Nah, nothing that a bit of Python hacking can't solve.

Exactly... if there is some time between Qt being merged and Wx being phased
out, translations can be added. The Qt translation tool (Qt Linguist) is
user friendly enough to be used by anyone.

Sounds fine with me,
