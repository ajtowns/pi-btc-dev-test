I totally agree with Thomas.

Another thing that I think could be a BIP misdesign:

BIP44 Gap Limits
>From the BIP:

----------
  "Address gap limit is currently set to 20. If the software hits 20
unused addresses in a row, it expects there are no used addresses beyond
this point and stops searching the address chain."
----------

* Does that mean, we do a transaction rescan back to the genesis block
for every 20 addresses?
* Or is it a prerequirement to do a wallet recovery after BIP44's to
have access to a full address-indexed blockchain?

Or maybe I'm missing something.
