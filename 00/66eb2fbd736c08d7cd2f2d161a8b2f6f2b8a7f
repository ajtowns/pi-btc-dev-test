I don't think Amir wants to put it into the protocol, but I still
don't like much the proposal if it has to rely on servers.
As an aside, even if firstbits it's not useful enough for the human
memory, it is still useful for QR-codes like in the case of green
addresses's POS instant payments.

Would it be too strange to use namecoin?
Some devices may need to rely on block exploring servers, but it is
the easiest decentralized solution that comes to mind.
