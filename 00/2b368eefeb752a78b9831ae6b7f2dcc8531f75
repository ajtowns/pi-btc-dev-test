Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Translators Needed for Bitcoin Core
Message-ID: <CAEz79PqWawZjD+w0CO7XmJay+tuaa2pKabUJieGatxcxekOXMg@mail.gmail.com>

You do not need to be a developer to help in the improvement of Bitcoin.

http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/32255092/
Bitcoin Core 0.9.2 feature freeze is May 13th, 2014.  Now is the time for
native non-English speakers to join Transifex to clean up the translations
in all languages.  This is important for more than just Bitcoin because
Litecoin will use these same translations.

*What should volunteer translators do?*

Try the nightly builds of Bitcoin Core as it heads toward 0.9.2.  Not
recommended for your production wallet.

https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/
Join Transifex as a translator and add your account to your language.

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-translators
Join the Translator mailing list to receive announcements when translations
are needed for Bitcoin.  You will also receive notifications if other
Bitcoin Project things in Transifex need translations (likely bitcoin.org).
