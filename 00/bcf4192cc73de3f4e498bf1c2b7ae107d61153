And yet, how many wallets can import BIP38 keys?  If someone gave me
one I would have no idea what software (if any) can understand it (nor
would I have any idea how to generate one in the first place).

Anyway, I'm not arguing against standardising these things - if people
are going to implement this then of course it's beneficial that they
implement it compatibly.  It was just a simple observation - make of
it what you will.
