That is incorrect. The OpenTimestamps servers are specifically designed not to
be trusted, and thus do not make any cryptographically verifiable attestations
as to when timestamps were created.

In the future I expect to add a trusted timestamping scheme via disposable keys
to the OpenTimestamps protocol, but that work isn't yet complete:
