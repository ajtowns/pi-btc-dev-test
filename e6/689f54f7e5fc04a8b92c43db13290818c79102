This is a potential problem, yes :( And I'm not sure how to solve it,
unless you do some crazy thing like commit to a set of keys which are
allowed to bundle, which kind of defeats the generality of outsourcing.

Indeed.

Not without SIGHASH_NOINPUT, no.

Yeah, let's not do that.

What would it spend though?  Can't use an existing output, so this
really needs to be stashed in an *output script*, say a zero-amount
output which is literally a push of txids, and is itself unspendable.

        <txid1>... <txidN>

That's pretty large though, and it's non-witness data (though
discardable).  How about 'OP_NOP4 <N> <ripemd160-of-last-N-txids>'?
Then the miner just bundles those tx all together?

Cheers,
Rusty.
