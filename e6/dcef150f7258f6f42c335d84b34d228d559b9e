9,000 of last 12,000 blocks is OK with me (I don't think scanning through
the last 12,000 block headers every new block will cause performance
problems, but I'd want to benchmark it to be absolutely sure).

Bitcoin Core will alert when automatically when 51% of blocks have a
version it doesn't understand.

It will also alert automatically if it detects a chain with more work that
it doesn't consider valid for some reason. And 0.11 contains code that
alerts if you're on a chain that is being mined really slowly.

Have you considered a "fail" condition?  For example, if 750 of the last

I like the fail-if-not-activated-by idea. Not so crazy about the vote idea
(what if miners set bits 3 AND 4 ?).
