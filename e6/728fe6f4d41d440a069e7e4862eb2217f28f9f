This is a good question. Does anyone think about why the bitcoins generated
from different blocks have the same value? Some of them are still
distinguishable ( if they are not combined with others sent out).  Would
the bitcoins that can be traced back to the block where it was generated
be worth different from others ?   If one day Satoshi released
his/her/their bitcoins  , would the bitcoins from the first several blocks
mined by Satoshi be worth more?

I think for fungibility, it is not like either it has fungibility or it has
no fungibility. There should be a value of fungibility (e.g. from 0 to 1)
that can be measured or evaluated.
