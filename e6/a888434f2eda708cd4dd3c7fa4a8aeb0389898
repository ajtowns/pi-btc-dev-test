I believe in the end it's the usability of bitcoin that matters.

For instance, a goal could be that no user on the network should wait more
than an hour to get 3 confirmations on the blockchain so that they can
actually have useful Bitcoins.

We can debate all we want about lots of technical aspects, but if you can't
send money what's the point?

My humble proposal tried to take that into consideration, but I like way
way more what you propose with NG.
