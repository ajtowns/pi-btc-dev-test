Certainly I have talked to much this month, my apologies.
I believe most of my posts (if not all) were on-topic but I could
still had repeated myself much less.
I've been trying to concentrate my usual points in documents or
threads that I can link to so that my comments can be shorter.
But, yes, most of my posts have been related to general consensus
topics and not specific to Bitcoin Core development (that's part of
why I think the bitcoin-consensus and bitcoin-dev lists would be a
good separation).
In any case, my apologies for this unplanned record.
