Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Segregated Witness BIPs
Message-ID: <em3b62e758-afbe-4aed-a08d-eb85b252efc4@platinum>

I've been working with jl2012 on some SEGWIT BIPs based on earlier 
discussions Pieter Wuille's implementation. We're considering submitting 
three separate BIPs:


CONSENSUS BIP: witness structures and how they're committed to blocks, 
cost metrics and limits, the scripting system (witness programs), and 
the soft fork mechanism.

PEER SERVICES BIP: relay message structures, witnesstx serialization, 
and other issues pertaining to the p2p protocol such as IBD, 
synchronization, tx and block propagation, etc...

APPLICATIONS BIP: scriptPubKey encoding formats and other wallet 
interoperability concerns.


The Consensus BIP is submitted as a draft and is pending BIP number 
assignment: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/265
The other two BIPS will be drafted soon.
