The broader point is that quadratic hashing is not a compelling reason to keep blockmaxsize post-HF: does someone have a better one?

I think this is exactly the right direction to head.  There are
arguments to be made for various maximum sizes... Maybe the limit
could be set to 1mb initially, and at a distant future block
height(years?) automatically drop to 500kb or 100kb?  That would give
anyone with existing systems or pre-signed transactions several years
to adjust to the change.  Notification could (?possibly?) be done with
a non-default parameter that must be changed to continue to use 100kb
- <1mb transactions, so no one running modern software could claim
they were not informed when that future date hits.

I don't see any real advantages to continuing to support transactions
larger than 100kb excepting the need to update legacy use cases /
already signed transactions.
