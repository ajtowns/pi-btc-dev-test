These analogies being brought are based on the goal of quick
payments, which is different from the goal of Bitcoin:
cryptographically sound, distributed consensus.

If you want zeroconf transactions, first realize that this goal currently
has no sound solution in Bitcoin and until it does, supporting it should
not be a part of the agenda. There are two paths going forward, not
independent of one another, that would achieve the goal of quick payments
for your coffee etc:
- Research/implement a solution that is consistent with the goal of Bitcoin
- Rely on a cosigning central authority

If you think the latter option is nasty, remember that people,
like corporations, can be nasty as well. Do not rely on the good faith of
people.
