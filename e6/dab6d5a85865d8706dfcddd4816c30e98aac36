So here's the parts that need to be done for step #1:


# Protocol Work

Basic idea is the miner makes two connections, their pool, and a local
bitcoind.

They always (usually?) work on the subset of transactions common to both
the pool's getblocktemplate and their local one. When they find a share
if it doesn't meet difficulty they just hand it to the pool. Currently
that is done by handing the whole block over, correct? I know the BIP
says otherwise, but we should optimize this to just hand over tx hashes
where possible.

If the share does meet difficulty, hand it to both the pool and the
local bitcoind. Should hand it to the pool first though, because the
pool likely has the fastest block propagation, then hand it to local
bitcoind. An optimized version may want to have some record of measured
bandwidth - this applies Bitcoin in general too, although also has other
issues.


## Reducing bandwidth

How about for normal shares we just pass the block header, and have the
pool randomly pick a subset of transactions to audit? Any fraud cancels
the users shares. This will work best in conjunction with a UTXO proof
tree to prove fees, or by just picking whole shares randomly to audit.

We'll need persistent share storage so if your connection disconnects
you can provide the pool with the full share later though.

Incedentally, note how the miner can do the reverse: pick random block
headers and challenge the pool to prove that they correspond to a valid
block. With some modifications Stratum can support this approach.


## Delibrate orphaning of slow to propagate blocks

Block headers can be flooded-filled much faster than blocks themselves.
They are also small enough to fit into a UDP packet. Nodes should pass
headers around separately via UDP, optinally with some tiny number of
transactions. When we see a valid block header whose contents we do not
know about a miner should switch to mining empty or near empty blocks in
solo mode that would orphan the still propagating block. Doing this is
safe, we'll never build on an invalid block, economically rational while
the inflation subsidy is still high, and helps reduce (although not
eliminate!) the advantage a large miner with high-bandwidth connections
has over those who don't.

Of course, the other option is to build a block extending the one you
don't know about, which is even more rational, but doing poses major
risks to Bitcoin...

This functionality can be implemented later - it's not strictly part of
pooled-solo mode.


# Pool work

So does eliopool already accept arbitrary shares like this and do the
correct accounting already? (IE adjust share amount based on fees?) What
happens when the pool doesn't get the share directly, but does see the
new block?

+ possible protocol extensions


# Miner work

Basically we need code to merge the two block templates together to find
commonality. I guess you probably want to implement this in bfgminer
first, so add the code to libblkmaker first, then maybe python-blkmaker.

We also want an automatic fallback to local solo mining if the pool
can't be contacted.

+ possible protocol extensions
