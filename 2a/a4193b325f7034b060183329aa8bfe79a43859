I'm not convinced that headers first will result in miners hashing on
top of the block with more work without knowing if it's valid yet
instead of just keep hashing on top of the longest known-to-be-valid
chain.
Both options are risky for the miner in some way, and I guess the
probability of someone hashing an invalid block above difficulty is
too low to be the main concern, but there's intermediate solutions,
like say, waiting to validate at least 5% of the block.

But I don't see how miners mining headers first would result in empty
blocks either.
Why wouldn't them validate and include transactions after they have
received the full block?
They will likely know most of the transaction before receiving the block anyway.
In a future where they ONLY live on transaction fees, why would they
refuse to validate and include transactions? What are they hashing for
then?
If anything, looks like a threat to the current situation with huge
mining subsidies coming from the seigniorage, not a problem that you
would have when the the seigniorage is gone.

In any case, it is true that this is mining policy and therefore out
of the realm of what the protocol can regulate, so we should assume
miners will do whatever it's best for them.

The trade-off between tps and centralization remains: if you want
higher tx volume, less full nodes will be able to process it.
