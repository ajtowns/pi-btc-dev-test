?It will need to be ?escaped, but HTTP URLs used in BIP72 have it already,
so don't see why we should bother.

?It definitely is an overkill. Don't think we should do it now unless we
will see later during implementation that we really have to.

Ok. Btw, I've tested ?QR possibilities on my PoS screen, in binary mode
it's limited to about 600 chars, so really I can include only unsigned and
rather short payment request. Signed requests longer than few hundred bytes
will not work.

Ok, so base43-aphanum is winning about a quarter of capacity against
base64-binary. I probably will skip this anyway and go with bluetooth URI
scheme we've just agreed + old style payments over p2p network as fallback.
So no payment requests in QR codes at all from my side.
