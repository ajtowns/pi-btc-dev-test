I'm having a hard time parsing this.  You might as well say that its
part of a weeblix for how informative it is, since you've not defined
it.

The signatures of a transaction can always be changed any any time,
including by the miner, as they're not signed.

They can already do this.

The RBF behavior always moves in the direction of more prefered or
otherwise the node would not switch to the replacement. Petertodd
should perhaps make that more clear.

But your "maybe"s are what I was asking you to clarify. You said it
wasn't hard to imagine; so I was asking for specific clarification.

They can already do that.

Then why do you not argue that changing the input set does not change
the weeblix?

Why is one case of writing out a participant different that the other
case of writing out a participant?

How could a _stronger_ warning be required?
