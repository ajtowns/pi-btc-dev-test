I have a reply to your point, but I want to clarify first that I am
not trying to provide any sort of criticism of your character, and to
any extent that my text is misinterpreted that way, that's entirely my
fault here. Anyway, here goes.

It's not enough to defend bitcoin and its users from active threats,
there is a more general responsibility to defend all kinds of users
and different software from many kinds of threats in whatever forms,
even if folks are using stupid and insecure software that you
personally don't maintain or contribute to or advocate for. Handling
knowledge of a vulnerability is a delicate matter and you might be
receiving knowledge with more serious direct or indirect impact than
originally described.

Besides the moral and ethical reasons to not unduly accelerate the
exploitation of a vulnerability, there is also a reputational
standpoint to consider, in that your position that your own (security)
work is credible is actually harmed by showing negative care for other
works by being first to publish either insecure software or knowledge
of a vulnerability. And sometimes the opposite is true: by not
disclosing knowledge of how a design is broken to someone inviting its
review, you're showing negative care in that way too, such as by
unintentionally encouraging the implementation of really bad ideas or
entirely novel misunderstandings of what you once thought were clear
concepts. So there is a difficult path to walk and especially in
security not all may be as it seems; caution is highly recommended.

Yes it would be good for "the market" to "get the signal" that
altcoins are insecure, and that some altcoin vendors are literally and
actively malicious entities, but I think everyone needs to take a step
back here and very carefully consider the color of their hats,
including those who advocate in the name of insecure downstream/forked
software.

The downside of the approach I've advocated for is that it requires
knowledge, thinking and outsmarting the red teams; I am certainly
aware of the allure of the approaches that involve absolutist
statements like "anything weak [including bitcoin if it does have
weaknesses] deserves to die and be actively exploited" but it's not
something I am interested in espousing...nor do I think it would be
healthy for this community to internalize that perspective. Instead we
should continue to work on highly defensible software, and keep
vigilant in regards to security. In "the [civilized] garden" I would
expect there to be a general understanding that people collaborate and
work together to build highly defensible evolving systems even if
there exists knowledge of vulnerabilities. But we shouldn't be
surprised when we don't go out of our way to contribute to
alternative/parasitic systems... and we shouldn't be encouraging each
other to actively bring about the eschaton by way of mishandling
knowledge of vulnerabilities...

I know these issues are difficult to get a handle on. Hopefully I've
provided some useful perspective.
