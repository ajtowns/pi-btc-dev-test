We should distinguish collision resistance from 2nd pre-image resistance, in general.

As previously written, we should care both hash output length and algorithm itself. The weakness of SHA-0 (preliminary version of SHA-1) was reported in 2004, then many research on the structure of SHA-1 were conducted. In the case of SHA-2, it is harder than SHA-1 to find collisions.

Existing security consideration and evaluation criteria were extensively discussed in the NIST SHA-3 competition. Please see the following sites.

https://ehash.iaik.tugraz.at/wiki/The_SHA-3_Zoo
https://ehash.iaik.tugraz.at/wiki/Cryptanalysis_Categories

We need similar analysis on RIPEMD160 and impacts of attacks on (RIPEMD160(SHA2(msg)). 

We can also refer the security assumption of hash chain in Asiacrypt 2004 Paper. 
https://home.cyber.ee/~ahtbu/timestampsec.pdf

In the discussion of SHA3 competition, we choose another hash design structure, so called "sponge structure." This leads diversity of design principles of hash function and gives resilience even when one hash design structure becomes vulnerable. As Peter Todd wrote, discussion on design structure and algorithm is important. Discussions on all of algorithm, output length and security requirements are needed.

At some future moment, we should think about transition of underlying hash functions. I?m working on this subject and will present an idea at IEEE S&B.

Assuming RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(msg)) has no flaws (i.e. is a random oracle), collisions can be generated in 2^80 queries (actually detecting these collisions requires some time-memory additional trade-offs). The Bitcoin network at the current hash rate performs roughly SHA-256 ~2^78 queries a day or 2^80 queries every four days. Without any break in RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(msg)) the US could build an ASIC datacenter and produce RIPEMD-160 collisions for a fraction of its yearly cryptologic budget.

In both scenarios, there is a question of nonrepudiation external to the protocol itself: by presenting a second pre-image of a key used to sign a transaction, a user/adversary can claim that his coins were stolen.

Specifically, in the first (notional) case the challenge would be to find a private key that has a public key that hashes to the final hash. In the second (realistic) case, you merely need to add the sha256 hash into the problem, which doesn?t seem to me to increase the difficulty by any significant amount?
