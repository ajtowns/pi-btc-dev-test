Good news!

Code to support 2x (the hard fork part of the proposal) has been out and
tested for much longer than that.


Not true. It's different code on top of segwit. The first attempt in btc1
(very recent) didn't even increased the size (because it changed the
meaningless "base size" without touching the weight limit. As for the
current code, I don't think it has been properly tested today, let alone
"for mucj longer than 1 year.
Anyway, I said, one year from tested release. Segwitx2 hasn't been
released, has it? If so, too late to discuss a bip imo, the bip may end up
being different from what has been released due to feedback (unless it is
ignored again, of course).
