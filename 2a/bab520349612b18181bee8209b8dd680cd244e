Unfortunate. What makes them not work out? DHT torrents seem pretty popular.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not proposing we do this if it requires additional
steps or other software. I only mean if it is possible in an easy way to
integrate the BitTorrent technology into Bitcoin in an automatic fashion. Yes
part of that may have to be finding a way to re-use the existing port for
instance.

Sure I guess my concern is more how do you find the specific part of the chian
you need without some structure to the network? Although I guess it may be
enough to just add that structure or depend on just walking the nodes
advertising themselves until you find what you want.

We can build this stuff incrementally I'll agree. It won't be the case that one
in a thousand nodes serve up the part of the chain you need overnight. So many
I am over engineering the solution with BitTorrent.

Good point. Sadly one that may apply to the Tor network too in the future.
