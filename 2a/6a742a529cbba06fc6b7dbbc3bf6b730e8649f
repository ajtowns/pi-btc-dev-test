I think one of the following is happening:

a) you have not read the document
b) you don't understand what accounts are, because you have not read
   the document
c) you don't understand how restoring accounts work, because you
   have not read the document
d) you don't understand that accounts funds are not meant to be mixed
   together, because you have not read the document
e) I got your emails wrong because I am not a native speaker,
   but please read the the document ;-)
