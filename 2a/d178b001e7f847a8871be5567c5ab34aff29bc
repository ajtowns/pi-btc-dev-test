Passing the session ID out of band is authentication. As this is explicitly not part of BIP151 it cannot be that BIP151 provides the tools to detect a attack (the point at issue).

>> It requires a secure channel and is authentication. So BIP151 doesn't provide the tools to detect an attack, that requires authentication. A general requirement for authentication is the issue I have raised.

The sarcasm is counterproductive Greg. By the same token I could ask how you ever use Bitcoin given that the P2P protocol is not encrypted or authenticated.

It doesn't matter who I am, maybe I am the NSA. I don't argue from a position of authority. Signing my emails while traveling on holiday with only my phone gets a little tedious.

The blockchain and mempool are a cache of public data. Transmission of a payment address to a payer is not a comparable scenario.

The possibility that authentication may become required to participate in this trustless network is a legitimate concern, and one that has not been addressed.
