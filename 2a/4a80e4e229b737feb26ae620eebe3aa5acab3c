BitcoinJ is widely used across the Bitcoin community; some users include Bitcoin Wallet for Android, MultiBit, Hive, blockchain.info, the biteasy.com block explorer (written in Lisp!), Circle, Neo/Bee (Cypriot payment network), bitpos.me, Bitcoin Touch, BlueMatt's relay network and DNS crawler, academic advanced contracts research and more.

This paragraph is signed by the same Bitcoin key as with previous releases (check their release announcements to establish continuity). Additionally, this email is signed using DKIM and for the first time, a key that was ID verified by the Swiss government.

The above makes for a great homework problem for budding cryptographers:
Why did the three forms of signature, DKIM, long-lived bitcoin address,
and Official Swiss Government Identity fail to let you actually verify
you have the right code? (but make for great security theater)

Bonus question: Who has the smallest work-factor for such an attack?

Two rewards of 25mBTC for correct responses to each question from a
crypto newbie.

Thanks

Soft-forking rule change.
