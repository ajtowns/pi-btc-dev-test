The reason for 60% of block were generated in China is same as the 
reason for 60% of your clothes were made in China. The electricity there 
is the cheapest on the planet. Many dams were built in the past 10 years 
and now they have huge amount of surplus electricity due to economic 
downturn.

Not sure if you are aware of this thread: 
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1072474.0 . Could you imagine 
this in any developed country? As long as mining is largely dependent on 
energy, there is no hope to break the balance/imbalance.

Bandwidth is probably only a few percent of miners' cost. There is no 
evidence that the current level of centralization is a result of block 
size. Instead, clear evidence has shown that centralization is a result 
of pool mining*, invention of ASIC, and disparity of energy cost. (* 
People started pool mining in 2010 because they wanted lower variance, 
not because of the inability to run a full node)

Even if we could quantify the level of centralization, it is a continuum 
and we must compromise between utility and centralization. Unless 
BIP101/103 is adopted, adjusting the hard cap always require a hardfork. 
For obvious technical and political reasons we can't have hardfork too 
frequently. Therefore, we need to leave some leeway: the hard cap may be 
a bit too high for today, but we are sure that technology will catch up 
in the near future.

Assuming we have plenty amount of "benevolent" miners, they will keep 
the block size low unless there is a real demand for larger block space. 
This is different from setting an individual soft limit, as that will 
lead to block size scarcity and therefore higher tx fee, which may be 
good for all miners. And as we say "miners can always decrease the block 
size with softfork or 51% attack", BIP100 materializes this possibility 
in a much smoother way.

I say "lucky" because I wholeheartedly believe it is good to keep the 
block as small as we really need. We can't do this by an equation so I 
would prefer to leave the power to miners (and they always have this 
power, anyway).

Jeff and Satoshi discussed this in 2010, although the flame throwing 
debate did not start until 2013.

The problem is the definition of "urgency" itself is controversial. And 
I believe an urgent hardfork should only be done as a bug fix, not 
implementation of a new feature. Block size increase should be a planned 
feature, as we don't want the tx fee raised to 10USD, before suddenly 
dropping to 0.01USD with the hardfork.

I don't think it's urgent today because my free tx always get mined. I 
don't know what is urgent and different people have different 
definition, but in general I think that should be measured by tx fee in 
USD. 0.001USD/byte may be intolerable for many people. (It's about 
$0.0001/byte now, and $0.0005/byte when it was $1200/BTC). It's not 
difficult to reach this level given the halving and potential bull 
market is coming.

As I argued above, it's already too late when things become really 
urgent. That will lead to serious market disruption, and the uncertainty 
could be very harmful to the development of the bitcoin economy.

As I said above, strictly limiting the block size may have little effect 
on mining centralization (because block size at this level is not a 
determining factor), while it may seriously suppress the utility.

I'm all for mining decentralization but block size is just not the right 
way to improve the situation.

I agree with you, but the balance between centralization and utility is 
also important. (and I believe the difference between 1MB and 8MB is 
tolerable, at least I must keep my full node running at this level)

I also have an idea to have a "decentralizedcoin", with very small 
blocks and everyone could mine with a CPU. That would be interesting if 
it is backed by famous devs in this area and is not 
yet-another-scamcoin.
