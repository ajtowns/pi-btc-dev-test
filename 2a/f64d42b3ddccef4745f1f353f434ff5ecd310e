Hi Amir,

reason for breaking with tradition.

excuse me if it was already discussed, but maybe using satoshis instead of
decimal bitcoin would be better choice? We all know about pains with proper
handling decimal numbers across of all implementations - and it's not only
about json-rpc.

Otherwise I agree, BIP 21 is better than BIP 20 because it's easier to
implement all points of the standard.

Best,
slush
