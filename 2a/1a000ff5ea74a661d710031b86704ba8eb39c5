Agreed.  I'll see if I can put together a couple different solutions,
and stick them in there.  ETA 3-4 weeks though, given current bugfix
workload + personal issues (moving to a new house).

I had a thought related to this, but readily admit I haven't thought
this through:  create an RPC in bitcoin that returns a random
selection of fresh P2P node addresses, from addr.dat.  One problem I
was running into was accessing this data from outside bitcoin.

Using ArtForz' half-a-node as a base was a possibility, but creating
"getnodes" RPC seemed far easier.

djbdns (tinydns) is great for this:  it is highly scalable and stable,
and its input is a -very- simple text format, easier to generate than
BIND zone files.

Great!  A big missing piece is simply trusted people running DNS seeds
on stable connectivity, once the DNS software is there.
