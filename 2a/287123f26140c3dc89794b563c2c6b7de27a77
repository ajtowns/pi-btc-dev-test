I think the description at your website leaves out the truly interesting part:
How do you decentralize this securely?
- How do Alice, Bob, Charlie and Dave communicate, i.e. which network is used 
for communication and how?
- How does Alice know that Bob, Charlie and Dave are not the same person?
(= how do you prevent a Sybil attack?)

Because thats the real problem with mixing it seems - ensuring that your 
mixing partners are actually 100 people and not just 1 attacker. There are 
probably many mixing algorithms which work if you solve that problem, but I 
don't see how you offer a solution for it :(
