Venzen --

The market for block space is not at all the same as the market for bitcoin.

The centralization risk that is discussed in relation to the market for
block space arises from the resources (network, storage, processor...)
required to run a full node.  That is a consideration in determining the
actual (as opposed to declared) capacity of the system.

The 1MB cap was not indexed to increasing resource availability to begin
with, so one way to determine the size of any initial hard cap increase
would be to estimate the change in resource availability since that time.
