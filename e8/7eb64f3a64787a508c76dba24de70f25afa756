Ok. I was thinking with another definition SPV proof.

For me a SPV proof is a sequence of bits which can be transmitted as
part of a non-interactive protocol that convincingly establishes for a
client without access to the block chain that a block B is part of the
best-chain.

I understand that SPV nodes require SPV proofs as defined in my
definition, but I can't realize how to prove that SPV nodes require SPV
proofs under your definition. So your definition sounds to me like one
possible solution, but not the need.
 
Is your definition something well-established in the community?
