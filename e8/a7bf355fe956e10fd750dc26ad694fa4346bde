This needs some clarification. If the USA has "requested" it, then presumably 
there's some legality involved, and our US developers shouldn't be made liable 
for it. The specific reason SourceForge has restricted access should be made 
known so non-US developers (or gitian builders) can evaluate their own laws 
and hopefully at least one will be in a jurisdiction that allows it.
But GitHub is also US-located, so hosting it there may be a problem too.
