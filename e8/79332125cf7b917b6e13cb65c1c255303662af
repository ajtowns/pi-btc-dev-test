Apologies for a noob question.

But if I understand correctly, lightning nodes need to check if a
counterparty is broadcasting an old channel state and in response broadcast
a penalty/justice transaction. Does that mean lightning nodes only need to
watch for transactions that come after the funding transaction? Is that the
only reason lightning needs to run bitcoind with txindex?

If that is the case, and a lightning node only needs to query transactions
broadcast after the funding transaction, then a pruned bitcoind instance
with txindex might be a bit handy.

Also from [1] it seems that indexing pruned nodes is not supported because
it doesn't make sense, not that it was infeasible. Now with the lightning
requirements, does an indexed pruned node start to make sense?

Once again, please forgive my naive understanding of some of the issues
involved and thanks for your patience.

Regards
Kulpreet
