Illustration:  If SW is deployed via soft fork, the count of nodes that
validate witness data is significantly lower than the count of nodes that
validate non-witness data.  Soft forks are not trustless operation, they
depend on miner trust, slowly eroding the trustless validation of older
nodes over time.

Higher security in one data area versus another produces another economic
value distinction between the two goods in the basket, and creates a "pay
more for higher security in core block, pay less for lower security in
witness" dynamic.

This economic distinction is not present if SW is deployed via hard fork.
