It's come up a number of times in the past that when there is no
subsidy we might expect slow convergence as miners try to orphan each
other instead in order to fee snipe.   What Peter pointed out here
that I had not previously considered and find interesting is was that
if there is a sufficient backlog (or nlocktime immature) of
transactions with fees beyond the maximum block size the incentive to
orphan blocks to take their fees is greatly reduced or eliminated.
