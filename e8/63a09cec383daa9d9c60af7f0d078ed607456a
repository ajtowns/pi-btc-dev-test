The same goes for http(s) one would not be able to use
http://google.com/user unless google offers the services.

ALSO look at DANE for getting around the certificate requirement for https

DNS TXT are not the only way forward, also registry/registrars can facilitate.

This most likely relies on a paid, valid certificate (that expires),
no self signed certs. I admit that running a secured https server with
a valid CA signed  cet is as simple/hard as running a DNSSEC authority
zone.

using a x.509 certificate to secure a bitcoin transaction removes some
of the anonymity of the transaction by allowing the lookup to identify
the certification, ca, crl etc thus connecting a transaction/bitcoin
address to the cert and to its issuing authority. No matter the
frequency of the destination bitcoin address changing.

IMNSHO, leveraging CAs to secure http to provide a lookup translation
to a bitcoin address will only erode anonymity. While DNS is connected
to whois there are provision for hiding behind a proxy where to the
best of my knowledge there are no such provisions offered by CA's
issuing x.509 certificates.

Should self signed cers be "allowed" or encouraged only decreases
security. Clearly DANE would be the only way to mitigate this
situation but then you are back to relying on DNSSEC to bind the x.509
cert.

wash, rinse,  ...
