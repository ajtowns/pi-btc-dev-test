I believe you meant to link here instead?

This looks reasonable from a brief skim over, but does not define any use 
cases (it mentions "necessary for atomic cross chain transfers", but does not 
explain how it is useful for that - perhaps that belongs in another BIP you 
haven't written yet, though). IMO, it should also require P2SH.
