Subject: [bitcoin-dev] AT&T has effectively banned Bitcoin nodes by
 closing port 8333 via a hidden firewall in the cable box

Keep in mind... Legal or Not, many ISPs (Comcast for example) prohibit
offering up network services (which a full node would supply) from
your residence.

I checked AT&T's TOS and they have a carve-out on equipment that is scary

http://www.att.com/legal/terms.internetAttTermsOfService.html

>Regardless of whether the equipment used to access your Service (modem, gateway, etc.) is owned by you or AT&T, AT&T reserves the right to manage such equipment for the duration of your Service, and retains exclusive rights to data generated by the equipment. Neither you nor a third party may change, interfere with, or block access to equipment data or settings.

AT&T seams to imply they implicitly have Admin rights to all
"equipment" that connects to their network.  Clearly an overreach that
needs to be clarified, but there it is.

As for Comcast, they simply forbid network "services" that serve
anyone off-premise.

http://www.xfinity.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/HighSpeedInternetAUP.html

> [MAY NOT] use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network
content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local
area network (?Premises
LAN?), also commonly referred to as public services or servers.
Examples of prohibited
equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web
hosting, file sharing, and proxy
services and servers

Technically, P2P is prohibited in the Comcast TOS, or at least by my
reading.  I realize that Comcast with deny this tooth and nail, but if
they ever want to exercise the prohibition, it is clearly spelled out
in their TOS

My recommendation is to file a complaint with the FCC to bring up your
issue as well as any overreach they spell out in the AUP or TOS.

As for me... I simply subscribed to a VPN.  That gives me both privacy
(to a degree) and flexibility to open or close whatever ports I want.
