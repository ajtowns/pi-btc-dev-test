Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Forget dormant UTXOs without confiscating bitcoin

The general concept has merit and the basic outline here seems sound
enough. I have harboured a notion for having "archived UTXO" for some
time, this is essentially it. The retrieval from archive cost is on the
UTXO holder not the entire storage network, which is then only bearing
full 'instant' retrieval costs for N blocks.
