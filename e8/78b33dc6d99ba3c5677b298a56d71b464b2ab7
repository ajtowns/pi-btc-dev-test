If we're keeping the clients page, I would really like to see the 
feature matrix linked from that page.  It shouldn't be on that main 
clients page (for the reasons already stated), but Stefan makes a point 
that /it is really useful for many users./  Add "Compare features of the 
various different clients here: <link>" and users who will benefit will 
most definitely click on it.  I think that's win-win.
