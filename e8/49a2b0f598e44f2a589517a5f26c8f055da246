Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BloomFilter issue with segwit addresses

As I understand it, the plan is to deprecated and remove BIP37 entirely once 
BIP158 is implemented and deployed.

In the meantime, Bitcoin Knots supports the MSG_FILTERED_WITNESS_BLOCK 
extension to download witness data. (Note that light clients currently have no 
way to verify the witness data is correct.)

As far as matching goes, why not look for the specific COutPoints? That should 
work already with standard BIP37.
