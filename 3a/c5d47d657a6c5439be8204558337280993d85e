Decision making is not the goal of this site, it is only a way to see
various pros and cons of various devs on various proposals in a single
place.
This is for the community to have a coherent view about what you are
talking about now spread into reddit/mailing/forums.

If you did not analyzed a proposal yet, you don't have to fill out your
opinion veto or approval.
It is only to show what you would you "approve" and what you would "veto",
after your analysis.
Then point out all the discussions in the opinion section that lead you to
your conclusion.

You can change edit your position as you progress into your analysis and as
new BIP get redacted.
I'm eager to include the new proposals.
