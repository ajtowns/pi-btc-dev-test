This is called child pays for parent and there is a three year old pull
request implementing it:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1647

The points regarding sweep transaction UI is out of scope for a BIP I'm
afraid. I suggest talking with wallet authors, and if agreement can be
found writing a pull request.
