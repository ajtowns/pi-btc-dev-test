>>> The values returned by OP_COUNT_ACKS vary in their exact value
depending on which block this transaction ends up in.  While the proposed
use of this operation is somewhat less objectionable (although still
objectionable to me), nothing stops users from using OP_EQUALVERIFY and and
causing their transaction fluctuate between acceptable and unacceptable,
with no party doing anything like a double spend.  This is a major problem
with the proposal.
