I will jump in just because I feel like it because the questions are
fun and so on.  (Of course I am not Gregory)

Note that I am not Gregory, so with that caveat...

No, it will have multiple and diverse purposes into which it can be
used for and can evolve, it would not be sufficient to state that it
has "a future" merely as a high-value settlement network.

If you have a proposal on this, please submit it in the formal way as
a BIP draft.   Enough time has been burnt on the subject, imho.

It is the market.  What will happen will happen.  If bitcoin
development pushes fees upward as an overall trend and the overall
cost to transact continues to increase, billions of people around the
world will as a result be forced out from most use cases of bitcoin
and the "bleeding out" will occur naturally to alts (to the extent
that persons already possessed bitcoin first and need to transact).
As stated above, liquidity moves to location of least friction.
Bitcoin bagholders can whine all they want, but value will distribute
into the alts gradually.

"allow" is not a relevant term here, as it is not up to anyone what
people are going to do with their crypto of any kind.  Unless, of
course, you are fool enough to be using Coinbase and Bitpay or
something like that.  They own "your" coin, and they will decide, or
allow, what you do with it or whether you can even access it.
As has been stated before here, I hope you are not using such services.
On the other hand, the following are very interesting:
https://gear.mycelium.com/ - a Payment processor
http://openbazaar.org a decentralized Market
https://bitsquare.io/ a decentralized Exchange
https://electrum.org/ a light wallet that you manage

 then:
> a) How much value is it acceptable to lose?

Irrelevant.  Better question is, How much should one give? The more
you can give, the better off you will be.

Too much attention is paid to the miners.  Miners should not be
butthurt when people say that we should not put them up on a pedestal.
 Think ahead, to when there will no longer be bitcoin mining such as
there is today.

People will continue to buy and sell.  Some major changes are in
store, however.  If you would like, see my reflections on what the
months ahead will hold, here:
