So then: make a proposal for a better process, post it to this list.

In practice there has been zero interest in improving the BIP process.

E.g. the BIP process was adapted from the Python Enhancement Proposals by Amir Taaki (in 2009 or so?). It hasn't really changed since then, apart from some spelling and grammar corrections. It is not specifically adapted to Bitcoin, and doesn't make a distinction between for example, consensus changes and non-consensus changes.

So that's up to someone to do. You seem to be enthousiastic about it, so go ahead.
