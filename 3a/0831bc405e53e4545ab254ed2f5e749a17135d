Hi Mike,

FYI there is a company called Netki is also working on a kind of DNSSEC

Netki's solution is incredibly limited, it's a single return value and no
metadata (where OA encapsulates metadata in KV pairs). This does not lend
itself well to handling BIP70-style communication.

As an aside, they also seem to have a complete disregard for lookup
privacy, which we address in OpenAlias by means of DNSCrypt encrypted
lookups. To that end we have even written the first independent DNSCrypt
implementation (ie. over-and-above dnscrypt-proxy) which provides a full
Python implementation that uses libsodium / nacl if available, but falls
back to a 100% Python slownacl implementation:
