Note how this is obviously an unsustainable situation - at some point that
change needs to be combined again, or you're throwing away money in the form of
UTXO's that aren't ever getting spent.

Meanwhile, if you put it another way the segwit discount is an obvious
advantage for coinjoin: by making spending UTXO's cheaper, we can recover those
funds that would otherwise get lost to dust, becoming ever more difficult to
spend.
