Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP32 "wallet structure" in use? Remove it?
Message-ID: <ljdd29$522$1@ger.gmane.org>

Does anyone use or plan to use the "wallet structure" part of the BIP32
document?

I suggest removing it from the document and maybe instead point at
BIP43. That new specification proposal just defines a "purpose" and
leaves everything else to the inventor of that purpose. The idea it that
over time a standard will evolve naturally rather than top-down.

I'd volunteer to submit a pull request if I can see some level of
consent here.
