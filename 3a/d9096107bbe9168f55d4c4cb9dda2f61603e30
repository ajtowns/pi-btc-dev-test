I count the 1 major merge then 8 commits to fix bugs or tweak
things...  I just tried reverting them and stopped when I got scared
I'll accidentally revert a fix we do want to keep.

Instead, I updated my gavinandresen/master github branch to the state
of the tree just before the OP_EVAL merge, so for code review purposes
you can look at:

https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/compare/master...pay_to_script_hash

There are unrelated 0.6 pulls in those changes, too, but it should be
pretty obvious what is what.
