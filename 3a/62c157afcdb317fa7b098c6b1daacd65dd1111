I think 25% bandwidth savings is certainly considerable, especially for
people running full nodes in countries like Australia where internet
bandwidth is lower and there are data caps.

I absolutely would not dismiss 25% compression. gzip and bzip2 compression
is relatively standard, and I'd consider the point of implementation
complexity tradeoff to be somewhere along 5-10%.
