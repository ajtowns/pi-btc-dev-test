The cost of the vote is completely irrelevant. What matters are the
resulting block sizes and transaction fees. Assuming rational,
profit-maximizing miners, BIP100 would allow them to effectively
enforce a cartel and to set block sizes (and thereby indirectly also
fees) at monopoly price levels. Charging something for a vote would
not affect that equilibrium and thus also neither affect block sizes
nor fees. Also note that monopoly prices are always at least as high
as competitive market prices. In other words: the transaction fees
that emerge under BIP100 will be higher than those that would emerge
with a flex cap mechanism that is based on the total marginal costs of
the miners. If you do not believe that, I'll happily go into the gory
details.

There are two types of flex cap mechanisms: First, there mechanisms
like the one I described previously which ensures that supply is based
on the actual costs of the miners. If done right, they can lead to a
competitive equilibrium with free market prices. Second, there are
flex cap mechanisms that simply replace todays centrally planned
constant cap with a centrally planned supply curve. If you believe in
central planning, that's ok. I for one prefer to avoid it. Also, it is
not much better than the constant cap, maybe even worse.

Note that neither type of flex cap adjusts to the marginal cost of the
entire network, simply because none of them can measure the cost of
running a full node, yet alone reliably detect the number of running
full nodes. Any attempt to do so would be futile anyway because it
would too easy to pretend-run full nodes in order to manipulate the
mechanism. When reasoning about full nodes, completely different
forces are at play. The only connection between full nodes and the fee
market is that larger blocks make it more expensive to run a full
node.

However, a holistic analysis must also reason about the benefits of
running a full node. I often see one-sided arguments saying that
increasing block sizes will make running one more expensive and thus
there will be fewer nodes. This logic is flawed because the economic
reasons for running a full node are not understood and taken into
account. An example reason could be the ability to monitor the network
and to verify transactions, which is very valuable to exchanges,
merchants and wallet services. To them, this value of running a full
node even grows with the number of customers. Thus, depending on the
circumstances, increase block sizes can counter-intuitively make it
more attractive to run a full node. The big picture from a systemic
perspective can look completely different than the conventional
micro-view that only sees first-order effects. Unfortunately, most
people are not great systems-thinkers.
