Haven't seen any message about this on the mailing list yet, so FYI:
0.9.0rc3 has been tagged.

The significant change compared to rc2 is that the mining code fee policy
now matches relay fee policy.

Also a rare crash in the wallet code was fixed.

There are some further small build system, documentation and GUI changes.

Please start your gitian builds.
