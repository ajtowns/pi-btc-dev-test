Identity need not be a hard problem.  In my view it is a solved problem.

You have a real world entity translated to a digital format.  Yes that can
be slightly ambiguous at time, naming is hard, and people do get this wrong
frequently.

The most common problem is to name something in a way that does not scale.
The solution to this problem is rather easy, and that is to use a URI to
name something, which makes it global and scalable.

In the case of bitcoin you could have use the bitcion URI scheme
