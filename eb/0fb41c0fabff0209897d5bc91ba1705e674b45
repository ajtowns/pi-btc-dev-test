Yes, I forgot the link:

That is a red herring.  Nobody I know has proposed this, and I am opposed
to changing that fundamental.

It is well known that the 1M limit was never intended to stay, unlike 21M
coin limit etc.

1M was set high in the beginning because it is a DoS engineering limit, not
an [accidental] economic policy tool.

Great!

I am arguing for continuing what we know works.  We are 100% certain
blocks-not-full-on-avg works, where a "buffer" of space exists between avg
block size and hard limit.

Any other avenue is by definition speculation and risk.  You _think_ you
know what a healthy fee market _should_ be.  Massive damage occurs to
bitcoin if you are wrong - and I listed several

vis expectation, there is clear consensus and expectation that block size
would increase, from 2010 onward.  It was always a question of _when_ not
if.

Sticking with 1M presents clear risk of (a) economic fracture and (b)
community fracture.  It quite clearly risks massive change to an unknown
system at an unknown, unpredictable date in the future.

BIP 102 presents an expected upgrade at a predictable date in the future.
