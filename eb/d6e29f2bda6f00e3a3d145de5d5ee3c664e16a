Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Why are my posts being put in new threads?
Message-ID: <CABr1YTf_s06Z4QgWLOSwjznLPrbGGVRk0=DxKTcGs6t6MZcMFw@mail.gmail.com>

I've made a couple recent posts that were intended for the Protocol
extensions thread but have been put in new threads. What part of the
email message is used to identify the thread to which it belongs? I
would have thought the subject, but apparently it isn't.
