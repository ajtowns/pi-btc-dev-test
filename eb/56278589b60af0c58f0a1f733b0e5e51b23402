 your thoughts?

Forward secrecy:
I was definitively already interested in using this.

Binaries:
Sourceforge is not encrypted, actually. Although binaries hosting /
sharing could be a separate subject discussed later I think.

Revocation:
I guess we could just buy another SSL cert from another CA (I mean, if
that really happens). There's a few ones that are not US based.

Decentralization:
So long as we actually use DNS, the website is centralized :( However,
its content isn't (can be forked on GitHub), but regarding the domain
name, there is not much we can do against this AFAIK.
