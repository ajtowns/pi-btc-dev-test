There's no reason to think Moore's law will last for 400 years; if it did
mining Bitcoin blocks would require astronomical energy levels. I haven't
actually done the math, but having to convert a mass-energy equivalance of a
planet or two per block is probably an accurate lower-bound even with quantum
computers. Once we're at that point, the problem is the speed of light: we'll
run out of energy in our 10 minute light radius, and thus need to get it from
farther away, at which point the 10 minute block interval forces a hard fork
anyway because mining no longer is in consensus.

tl;dr: This is a topic for sci-fi writers, not bitcoin-dev
