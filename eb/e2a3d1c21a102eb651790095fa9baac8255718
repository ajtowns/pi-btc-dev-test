By deciding to use a decentralized network to hold your assets, it may
make more sense to emit less shares. Two billion shares backed by
coloured coins makes less sense than a more conservative number, like
10,000. That costs a negligible amount of money, at least until the day
when Bitcoin takes over the world and a satoshi becomes very expensive.
But it is irrelevant now.

If you have already created a massive amount of shares for your company,
then the only reasonable solution is for a coloured coin to represent a
bundle of shares as Flavien suggested. Some shareholder could emit
another coloured coin instrument with a genesis block based on a smaller
set of shares to trade among smaller investors unwilling to deal in
terms of the bundled shares.

We need to understand that coloured coins provide benefits, but also has
constraints that are not difficult to live with.
