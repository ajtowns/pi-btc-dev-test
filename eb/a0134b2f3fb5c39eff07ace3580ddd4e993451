Which again means that the statement regarding Audits through the Master
Public key, M, is wrong - only incoming and outgoing transaction of
_publicly_ derived wallets will be part of the audit... Privately
derived wallets cannot be obtained, though you could, without loss of
security, share also the addition points from privately derived wallets:
(m/i')*G, but there is no concept of a single public master key.

==
Audits: M
In case an auditor needs full access to the list of incoming and
outgoing payments, one can share the master public extended key. This
will allow the auditor to see all transactions from and to the wallet,
in all accounts, but not a single secret key.
