BIPs often should include code.

The "real" license in this case is the BSD 2-clause. However, BIP 1 only 
allows OPL and public domain, so BIP 2 is available under OPL as well so that 
it is acceptable before/until it activates also.

CC0 and public domain are two different things.

Yes, you're right. I'll post to Lightning-dev and libbitcoin's list about
BIP 2. If you're aware of any other Bitcoin development discussion groups, 
could you please bring BIP 2 to their attention so it gets wider review?

As I understand it, presently France and Germany do not recognise public 
domain as a possible status. GPL is merely a copyright license, so it should 
be valid anywhere copyright laws exist.
