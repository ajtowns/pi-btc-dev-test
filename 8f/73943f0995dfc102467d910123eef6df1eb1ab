Namecoin makes sense; as we can use the same private keys to spend the
namecoin as spending the bitcoins.

Namecoin happens to be the only secure guaranteed global unique human

I suggest that sending bitcoins to a namecoin name is the way to go...
It makes even more sense since namecoin started merged mining.
