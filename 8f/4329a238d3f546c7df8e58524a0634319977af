You're right that it is better that there be more APIs than fewer,
that is less of a single point of failure.  It also depends what you
mean by APIs: using an API to have a second cross-check of information
is quite different to building a wallet or business that only
interfaces with the blockchain via a 3rd party API.  There are
different APIs also: some are additive eg they add a second signature
via multisig, but even those models while better can still be a mixed
story for security, if the user is not also checking their own
full-node or checking SPV to make the first signature.

Power users and businesses using APIs instead of running a full-node,
or instead of doing SPV checks, should be clear about the API and what
security they are delegating to a third party, and whether they have a
reason to trust the governance and security competence of the third
party: in the simplest case it can reduce their and their users
security below SPV.

The bigger point however, which Erik explained, was: widespread use of
APIs as a sole means of interfacing with the blockchain also
contributes to reducing network security for everyone, because it
erodes the consensus rule validation security described under
"Validators" in the OP.
