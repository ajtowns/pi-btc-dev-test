Why would you use a hash of hashes? Wouldn't it be simpler and just as effective to use either:

1) the genesis block hash, or
2) the block hash of the first block in a fork?

Every block hash in a chain implicitly subsumes the genesis block hash of that chain, so there's no need to incorporate the genesis block hash again.
