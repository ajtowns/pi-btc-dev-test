I think your history of patenting(1) Bitcoin consensus relevant technology is
sufficient by itself to be extremely dubious of any proposals coming from you
or your colleagues; patents on Bitcoin consensus technology are a serious
threat to decentralization. Personally, I'm NACKing this proposal on that basis
alone.

You need to rectify this dangerous and unethical behavior in a convincing,
legally binding way. I'd suggest looking into Blockstream's patent pledges as a
way forward:

I see no reason to have any further discussion of your proposal until this is
rectified.
