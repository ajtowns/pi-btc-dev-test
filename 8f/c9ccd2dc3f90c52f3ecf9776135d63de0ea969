If you're going to take a step like that, the <current-chain-height>
should be rounded off, perhaps to some number of bits, or you'll allow
DNS caching to be defeated.

Make clients check for the largest "rounded off" value first, and then
drill down if required. Some complexity involved...

Maybe I should make my blockheaders-over-dns thing production worthy
first so we can see how many ISP's come at us with pitchforks? :P
