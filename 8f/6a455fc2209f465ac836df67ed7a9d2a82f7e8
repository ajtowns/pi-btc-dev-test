The underlying issue is what is the pools expenses compared to yours.
There is an overhead to mining, you need to spend money and time (and
hence money) running and administering full nodes at the very minimum.
The pool can amortise that cost over many hashers; the solo miner can't.

Pools will of course have some profit margin, but why would you expect
that margin to not be sufficiently low to make it in a solo-miner's
interest to join the pool? Both the pool and the former solo-miner earn
more return after all if they centralize.

The fundemental issue is that in the design of Bitcoin there is an
incentive for miners to join into pools, and that incentive exists at
any amount of hashing power. Sure second order effects like regulation
and social pressure can counteract that incentive in some circumstances,
but that's not very strong protection.

However p2pool doesn't necessarily need a linear blockchain to function,
so there is a potential for stales to be much less relevant.
