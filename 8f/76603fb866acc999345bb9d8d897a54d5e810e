No, I was thinking of the height in coinbase change. At any rate, p2sh was
supported by the consensus code in bitcoinj for a long time already, since
it was first written.

Support for sending to such addresses in the wallet appeared once an app
that wanted that support also appeared, which seems OK - the market for
wallets is very competitive so there will always be some skew in what
features are worked on in what order. V3 transactions are a consensus
change that wallets will pick up at different times like any other feature.
