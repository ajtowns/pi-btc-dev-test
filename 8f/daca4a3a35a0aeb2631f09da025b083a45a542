Subject: [Bitcoin-development] [QT] Feature proposal: Displaying current
 Units/Changing Units with status bar control.
Message-ID: <CADZB0_YZ==Kd-R10d996E=6X-VoVhyE0cvW=_LGXJvQLAbVUpw@mail.gmail.com>

There's been quite a lot of debate over the default unit of display to use,
you can read the conversation here, which was closed.
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3862

Whatever the side of the debate you're on, wether it should be BTC or mBTC,
or other, regular users will probably take too long to find a way to change
the current unit of display, and if the unit of display were ever changed
to something other than BTC, the current transaction tables"Amount" column
don't mention anywhere what Unit of Display is being used.

So last night I started playing with the idea of having a status bar
component that would:
1. Show you what is the current unit of display at all times.
2. Let you change the unit of display easily.

Here's how it looks (see attachment), just wanted to get feedback, if this
is something you also consider valuable in terms of user experience, or
maybe you don't want to allow any more controls on the status bar (because
then people will want to add more and more)

Just want to get some feedback before I continue working on this to polish
it and submit a pull request.


Cheers.
