I'm afraid I'm losing you here.  The node advertises himself to
everyone he is connected to and in/or out, those nodes pass along
those advertisements.  When I receive an advertisement from a node I
do not know how far away the advertised peers is, presumably I can
accurately exclude it from being 0-hops? itself?) 1 or more should be
indistinguishable. Is there a reason that they're distinguishable that
I'm missing?

Can you explain to me how you propose to produce this mapping?
