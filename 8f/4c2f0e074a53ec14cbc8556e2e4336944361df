Good morning Paul,

Thank you for your consideration.

I don't see how this regress occurs.  Perhaps I need more information on extension blocks.

Any miner that rejects a bribe from outside the miner-group in order to put their desired hash on the sidechain, values their desired hash more than the bribe to put a different hash.  This rejection is a loss of potential proift, and other miners who accept the bribe gain the profit from it.

Your last paragraph does not make sense to me.  I suspect I have hit upon a nerve and will make no further comment on this sub-topic.

This is indeed the problem.  SHOM, as it unifies merge mining and WT^ voting, also allows theft attempts, and once the money available for withdrawal exceeds the sum of 288 bribes, we enter a dollar auction game between the thief and the sidechain users: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction

As thieves are expected to follow the simple greedy algorithm, sidechain death can be triggered by a single theft attempt.

Assuming potential thieves understand the dollar-auction irrationality, they may be disincentivized, as presumably there are more sidechain protectors than thieves, and the sidechain protectors can (we hope) all outbid the thief.  But the problem is that this require rational behavior from thieves.  Mere greedy algorithm, or disruption for the sake of disruption, would still collapse SHOM sidechains.

But given the many parallels between SHOM and drivechains: what happens if 26% of miners disrupt all sidechains by always downvoting WT^?  In that case, sidechains still collapse as a whole, with practically the same effect as the SHOM thief.

We could limit the money available for withdrawal, but that weakens the side-to-main peg, reducing the value of the sidecoin relative to the maincoin.

The problem, to my mind, is that blind merge mining is pointless if it does not also allow voting on WT^.  In the end, no matter how novel a sidechain may be, what is valued is the maincoin backing the sidecoin; that is the whole point of the two-way peg.  A sidechain user may OP_BRIBEVERIFY valid sideblocks onto the mainchain, but if that user cannot vote on WT^ anyway, no matter how valid sideblocks committed on the mainchain, it would be pointless if the sidechain is attacked by mainchain miners.  You may as well remove blind merge mining, as miners who must vote on WT^ will need to understand the sidechain validity rules anyway.

I do not quite follow.  Can you expand more on this?

Thank you.

In order to attack multiple sidechains, bribing thieves must pay bribes for each sidechain being attacked.  Even if a miner attacks, bribes for valid sidechains must be rejected by the miner, effectively reducing the miner's profits, and the bribes to be rejected must be for all the sidechains to be attacked.

If withdrawals have a fixed or maximum value, then the bribe a thief must be prepared to pay (or turn down, in the case of thieving miners) must be no more than the maximum value / 288.

Unfortunately, capping withdrawals weakens the side-to-main peg, which weakens the reason for even using SHOM.  This is the true weakness of SHOM: it provides only a very weak side-to-main peg.

I agree.

Yes.

I am fine with some economic bond or proof-of-burn to start a sidechain.  But I am opposed to any permissioned method of starting sidechains.  To my mind, asking miners to install your software is already permissioned.

Thank you.
