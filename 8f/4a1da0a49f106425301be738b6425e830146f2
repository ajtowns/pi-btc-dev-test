I don't interpret this as "treating version bits as a number" it is just
being explained which bit we're talking about. Could you propose some
concrete rephrasing instead of leaving the task of somehow solving this
vague and subtle concern to the author?

I very much disagree with "significant" and in any case it depends on the
hardfork: the changes required can still be quite minimal in all cases and
it should never be a problem, even for emergency hardforks. In emergency,
we could for example just a new global (we have many already anyway),
although activeChain.tip () is already there and one can simply get the
last height or median time from there.

This is consistent with bip99, which recommends bip9 for deploying
uncontroversial hardforks.

Controversial hardforks (as defined bip9) always have the potential to
create two chains that survive for unbounded amounts of time (maybe
forever) as discussed in one of the few threads of the bitcoin discuss
mailing list.
Of course, BIP99 cannot say anything general about the "legitimacy" of all
controversial hardforks since ASIC-reset hardforks, for example, are
controversial hardforks by definition in the context of bip99 (and the
definitions in bip99 seem to apply to this bip). BIP99 can only warn about
the dangers and risks of controversial hardforks but at some point (let's
hope never) a controversial hardfork may be required to save the system
from some evil (say, evil miners blacklisting via softforking out the
miners that don't  blacklist or something) and that controversial hardfork
would be legitimate (at least to the eyes of some).
