Subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.4rc1 known bugs
Message-ID: <CABsx9T1juB-0hr9NW=PoO5eh_Aqhzkiv3tnXTSTsjBKiy4y0JA@mail.gmail.com>

Quick status update on 0.4; I probably won't have time to tackle these
properly before Tuesday:

+ sipa found what looks like a deadlock between the addr-handling and
IRC-join-handling code.
+ UukGoblin reports a deadlock problem on a bitcoind handling getwork requests.

If you want to get more familiar with the bitcoin code and you have a
lot of patience, tracking down deadlocks a great way to do it.

+ ArtForz found a performance bug with transactions that have
thousands of inputs and outputs on the solidcoin test network.
 (not as big an issue for bitcoin due to fees being based on
transaction size, but still worrying)
