Storing an unspent transaction in the block chain costs money because we
can't prune it. However, it would completely destroy confidence in Bitcoin,
as far as I can see. It makes sense economically, but it  isn't feasible if
we want to maintain people's confidence in Bitcoin.

I like Jeff's proposal of letting an alt-coin implement this. If it gets to
the point where Bitcoin can't function without this functionality, it'll be
a lot easier to make the transition, instead of now, when it's not really
needed, and the trust in Bitcoin really isn't that great.
