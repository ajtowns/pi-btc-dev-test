Sorry for the off-topic but while reading this I like to ask you for
picocoin, see:

https://github.com/jgarzik/picocoin

For a research project I'm looking for a C library to operate some block
chain analysis (parsing raw blocks and transactions). Has anyone of you
experience with picocoin for that? Are there any relevant limitations?
