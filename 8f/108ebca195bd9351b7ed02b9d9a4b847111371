You complained about the lack of quantitative analysis being used, I gave it to you. There's nothing "negative" about displaying data which doesn't completely back up what your position is, I made a sensible conclusion based on the facts I have in front of me. Ignoring the information I collected and presented for you is incredibly childish.

I should stress that I didn't present that timing information as a dig against their software, it just happens to be something I have direct access to and can prevent clean data about. The point that I was attempting to make is that Bitcoin Core isn't the only piece of software in the ecosystem with performance problems, given that a large portion of users have Electrum wallets it would be insane not to consider the impact changes will have on the people that charitably run servers for the community. 

By the way, is that an offer to buy my dedicated server some new SSDs?

Scaling up isn't tweaking parameters and ignoring the brickwork falling around your head. You mention that you think the merkle tree can hold an unlimited amount of information, that's all very well so long as people can actually validate the thing. Miners aren't even willing to validate their own blocks at the peril of losing $7000 USD (on two occasions now), so why would anybody else?
