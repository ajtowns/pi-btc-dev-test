They're _not_ phasing out into SPV wallets from what I can say. At
around the 24th of February, there has been a sharp change of the
"current installs" graph of Bitcoin Wallet. That number used to grow at
about 20.000 per month. After that date until now, it just barely moves
horizontal.

My guess is that a large number of users have lost interest after they
lost their money in MtGox. The 24th of February coincides with the
"final" shutdown, according to
