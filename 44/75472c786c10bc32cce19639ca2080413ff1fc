Some practical nits:

- Physical keys are vulnerable to photography-based reproduction attacks.
That gets even worse if you use them to identify to a digital system as you
can leave out the tiresome manual reproduction step.

- The output from computer vision algorithms is notoriously noisy. If you
use that as input for hashing a private key, it may become hard/impossible
to reproduce (also, physical objects may deform over time).
