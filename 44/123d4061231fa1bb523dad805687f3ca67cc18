I don't understand what you're talking about here; if you have no peer
at all you will learn nothing about the Bitcoin network.

Can you clarify?

What mechanism are you referring to specifically?

On our initial connections we do have a preference for nodes we knew
were up recently. This could be made further. That the current
behavior isn't great isn't an argument for making it worse on that
dimension.
