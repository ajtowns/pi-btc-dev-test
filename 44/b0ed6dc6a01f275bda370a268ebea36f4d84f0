Thanks for the update.

I was even unaware of of #2844 : 'The beginnings of a block explorer-style
API for bitcoind.'

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2844

Seems to me like an important piece of work, Im glad it's finally made the
cut.

Firstly, apologies in coming in late to the conversation.  As I am also
working on a REST API for electronic coins.  Some questions:

1. Is there a BIP, or some other doc (e.g. gist), outlining the REST output
e.g. the response format and MIME types.  Or just compile from source?

2. How set in stone is v1 of the the going forward?  PS I support @maaku's
comments re: "/api/v1/" -- tho I guess it is too late for that now.

3. Would there be any support to develop this interface into something that
would be W3C standards compliant, or reviewed by the REST community.  So
for example a context can be provided to self document the terms (something
I've almost completed) and would allow standardization of block explorer
and bitcoind outputs.  Right now every explorer seems to have a different
JSON output.

Great work!  Looking forward to seeing this go live and how it devlops!
