This could get noisy. Clarification that only *development* help is 
appropriate for the list would improve it.

Probably should note that entirely new threads should be new messages, *not* 
merely a reply with a changed topic (as changing the topic does not in fact 
start a new thread).

Threads like this one are off-topic, yet we have no obvious other venue for 
it.. :(

IMO this seems like not only a waste of time, but also futile for anyone not 
exclusively associated with a single company/organization.
