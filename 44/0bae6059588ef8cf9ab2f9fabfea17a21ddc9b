Ok good. We have established it to be a non-trivial cost.
Now, what is the growth complexity of the total cost of the network in
terms of number of connections each hub has to other hubs? And then,
consider a payment channel with many hops in it. The end-to-end users would
have to swallow all the costs of the hubs in the channel.
