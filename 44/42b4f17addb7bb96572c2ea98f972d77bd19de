Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Abnormally Large Tor node accepting only
	Bitcoin traffic

Hey,

There is a potential network exploit going on. In the last three days, a
node (unnamed) came online and is now processing the most traffic out of
any tor node -- and it is mostly plaintext Bitcoin traffic.

Alex Stamos (cc'ed) and I have been discussing on twitter what this could
mean, wanted to raise it to the attention of this group for discussion.

What we know so far:

- Only port 8333 is open
- The node has been up for 3 days, and is doing a lot of bandwidth, mostly
plaintext Bitcoin traffic
- This is probably pretty expensive to run? Alex suggests that the most
expensive server at the company hosting is 299?/mo with 50TB of traffic
