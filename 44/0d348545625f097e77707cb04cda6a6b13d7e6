Hi Erik,


Sorry, you're right - I thought we mentioned m-of-n as a footnote but that was
actually in the earlier pre-MuSig version of our multisig paper.

Threshold signatures -are- mentioned in the BIP which started this thread, though.
At https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki we say

    "Further, by combining Schnorr signatures with Pedersen Secret Sharing,
     it is possible to obtain an interactive threshold signature scheme that
     ensures that signatures can only be produced by arbitrary but predetermined
     sets of signers. For example, k-of-n threshold signatures can be realized
     this way. Furthermore, it is possible to replace the combination of
     participant keys in this scheme with MuSig, though the security of that
     combination still needs analysis. 

and this combination of MuSig and VSS is exactly what is implemented in my code.



Cheers
Andrew

 Never saw what we could unravel in traveling light
 Nor how the trip debrides like a stack of slides
 All we saw was that time is taller than space is wide"
