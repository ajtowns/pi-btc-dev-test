Nobody has pointed out I am "wrong," it is just semantics about the term 
"decider" and I am just essentially repeating things said by others.    
As for the term "troll," that is used primarily used by teenagers to 
deal with people they don't agree with.  Unfortunately the developers 
are often 20-something kids like yourself who have never dealt with a 
large system of diverse stakeholders or anything outside of their 
specific technical areas.

As for your claim that I accused someone of something, I don't know what 
you are talking about.  If you don't like my messages then don't read 
them.  It looks to me like you don't like the idea of the developers 
being questioned about their authority which is understandable as one of 
the people involved in Blocksteam because you want the system to stay 
the way it is.

If you want to moderate the list the go ahead, I can't stop you but I am 
not going to listen to anyone who uses the term "troll."
