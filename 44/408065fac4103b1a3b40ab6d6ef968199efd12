He is just pointing out reality. Decentralization is really just a 
collection of centralized processes. If you ever want to change anything 
someone, somewhere has to make a decision.

Satoshi was the first dictator and he set the consensus rules for his 
version of Bitcoin and that is what people accepted. Those rules did not 
appear by magic nor did they appear via some unexplained 'consensus' 
mechanism. He made decisions and updated the code or accepted updates 
made by others.
