There appears to be common agreement on that.

The only source of some controversy is how to deploy: versionbits versus
IsSuperMajority. I think the versionbits proposal should first have code
out there for longer before we consider it for concrete softforks. Haste-ing
along versionbits because CLTV is wanted would be risky.

As you say, the underlying code has been merged for months in master, and #6351
seems to have had quite some eyes on it already.

It does need to be made sure that the backports are correct, however.
Although the tests do provide some assurance, I think those two pulls
require more review.

After they are merged, a 0.10.3 and 0.11.1 release can be rolled out (with RC
cycle).
