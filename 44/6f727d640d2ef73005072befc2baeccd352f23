Separate from scale, there is utility to a hard-fork to fix wish-list
bugs that cant be reasonably fixed via soft-fork.  The spoonnet
proposal fixes a good number of interesting bugs.  Spoonnet and
several other HF research proposals can be found here
https://bitcoinhardforkresearch.github.io/  Part of the research on HF
is about safe deployment methods which is obviously the other main
consideration.  It seems to me likely that if the HF were to focus on
bug fixes, and not mix in new tradeoffs of security vs scale, it would
more easily reach consensus.
