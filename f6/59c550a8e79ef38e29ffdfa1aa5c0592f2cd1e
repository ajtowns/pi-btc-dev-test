If anyone feels that protecting those running full nodes from bitcoind
eating more and more memory this way is a good idea, I can make a BIP out
of it if that would help.

You are completely right: this problem has nothing to do with the consensus
block size maximum and it has to be solved regardless of what the maximum
is. No BIP is necessary for this. The "doing nothing side" has been working
on this too:
