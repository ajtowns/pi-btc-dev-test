False positives, and if you have more than one peer? false negatives.
(or a rule for what you must keep which is conservative in order to
avoid creating huge storage requirements? but then also has false
negatives).

Yes, minimizing latency in the face of multiple peers.

Otherwise no. And certantly no reason to to implement something simple first.
