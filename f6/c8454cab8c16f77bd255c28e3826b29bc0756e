a) Is there a paper detailing bitcoin traceability issues?
Particularly when using various combinations of the often
advised 'use different address for every transaction', 'wash coins',
and 'use anonymity networks' privacy enhancement methods.

b) People would be nuts to reject tainted coins on the current
chain, or any chain. How many of the bills in your wallet passed
through 'illicit' transactions? How would you feel if your payee's
serial checker bounced yours, possibly forcing you to dispense
with them through other, possibly illicit, means? What about a
total blackball? Who's going to compensate you? How exactly do
you roll that all back? And are you going to KYC and scour the lives
of your every potential customer beforehand? What if someone has
money to burn and blackballs a million notes for fun. A currency of
common global adoption that you can't spend after some thieving
crackdealer bought an onion off your garden stand isn't of much use
to anyone, not even the purists who come up with such ideas.
Specialized currencies in special markets, sure, maybe, all still
fraught with the same dilemmas. But for a global common one? No.
