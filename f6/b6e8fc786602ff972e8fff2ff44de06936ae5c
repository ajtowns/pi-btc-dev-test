Marco points out that if the parent is RBF, this child inherits it, so
we're actually good here.

However, Matt Corallo points out that you can block RBF will a
large-but-lowball tx, as BIP 125 points out:

   will be replaced by a new transaction...:

   3. The replacement transaction pays an absolute fee of at least the sum
      paid by the original transactions.

I understand implementing a single mempool requires these kind of
up-front decisions on which tx is "better", but I wonder about the
consequences of dropping this heuristic?  Peter?

Thanks!
Rusty.
