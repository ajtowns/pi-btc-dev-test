Might be worth looking into the recent RFC?7258: Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack for some guidance on how to write such a social contract.

Re: Gavin, note the language in the foundation bylaws:

Section 2.2 The Corporation shall promote and protect both the decentralized, distributed and private nature of the Bitcoin distributed-digital currency and transaction system as well as individual choice, participation and financial privacy when using such systems.

You might want to do a pull-req to add fungibility and rejection of blacklists to that list; note Adam Back's comments on how fungibility and privacy are inherently linked.
