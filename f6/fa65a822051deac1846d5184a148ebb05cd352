Yes, quite true. And without the ability to search using filters there
is no private restore from backup short of downloading the full chain,
rendering the idea rather pointless.

This is why privacy remains a significant issue. Privacy is an essential
aspect of fungibility. This is a central problem for Bitcoin. The
correlation of addresses within transactions is of course problematic.
Possibly zero knowledge proof will at some point come to the rescue. But
the correlation of addresses via search works against the benefits of
address non-reuse, and the correlation of addresses to IP addresses
works against the use of private addresses.

Solving the latter two problems can go a long way to reducing the impact
of the former. But currently the only solution is to run a full chain
wallet. This is not a viable solution for many scenarios, and getting
less so.

This is not a problem that can be ignored, nor is it unique to Electrum.
The Bloom filter approach was problematic, but that doesn't preclude the
existence of valid solutions.

Well because of presumed relationship in time these are not actually
separated requests. Which is why even the (performance-unrealistic)
option of a distinct Tor route for each independent address request is
*still* problematic.

Introducing truly-random timing variations into the mixnet solutions can
mitigate timing attacks, but yes, this just makes the already
intolerable performance problem much worse.
