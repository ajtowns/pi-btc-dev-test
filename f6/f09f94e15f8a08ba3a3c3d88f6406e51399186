I agree that the historical reasons are irrelevant from an engineering perspective. But they still set a context for the discussion?and might help shed some insight into the motivations behind some of the participants. It?s also good to know these things to counter arguments that start with ?But Satoshi said that??

What?s critically important to note is that several of the assumptions that were being made at the time this limit was decided have turned out wrong?and that these other issues should probably be of greater concern and more highly prioritized in any discussion considering the merits of deploying potentially incompatible consensus rule changes. It seems if these other issues were fixed perhaps no block size limit would be required at all (as was originally hoped).

Bitcoin is a decentralized payment network, and the relationship between utility (block size) and decentralization is empirical. Why the 1MB limit was put in place at the time might be a historically interesting question, but it bears little relevance to the present engineering issues.
