Would be nice to have a secure page at bitcoin.org, though, rathar
than having to go to github - certs from somewhere like Namecheap
should cost you next to nothing.  For those of us too lazy (not
paranoid enough) to bother with GPG, a (secure) page on bitoin.org
with the MD5 hashes of the binaries would be awesome...
