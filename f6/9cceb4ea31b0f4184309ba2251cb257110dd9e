I think this conversation has gone off the rails and is no longer really
appropriate for the list.

But just to be clear to any readers.  Bitcoin Core absolutely does rely on
the impossibility of a hash collision for maintaining consensus.  This
happens in multiple places in the code but in particular we don't check
BIP30 any more since the only way it could get violated is by a hash
collision.
