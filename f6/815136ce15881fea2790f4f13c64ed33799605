This post by Gavin got rejected by the moderators.

Without a doubt this moderation policy is already a disaster. I'm fully
expecting this message to get rejected too, but so you can see it Rusty: so
far in the reject bin there are messages from:

   - Well known uber-troll Gavin Andresen
   - And his partner in crime, Sergio Damian Lerner
   - Someone discussing a bug
   - Someone who wants to discuss CLTV
   - Someone pointing out that censorship of technical discussion is rarely
   a good idea
   - Someone pointing out that censorship of people complaining about
   censorship is also taking place.

WTF?
