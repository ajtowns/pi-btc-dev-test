Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Numerifides - Proposal for Decentralized
	trust/authority on Bitcoin blockchain
Message-ID: <CAEegQfVLWSySWfCbSmGG4V0i6GMpgyUr=86Qzb4YE9s+M5K1gg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I have been working on a proposal called Numerifides which would provide a
general method to register human-readable names and arbitrary data (such as
username->GPG key, domain->IP address, Lightning node Alias-> URI, etc).
Here are the key highlights:

--New transaction type called "numerifides" transactions
--Lock up Bitcoin for a certain amount of time to make the mappings valid,
discourage "namesquatting"
--Transaction puzzle attached to transactions to allow community consensus
revocation of highly contested names or "squatted" name mappings.
--Transactions are RBF so if name is contentious or miners wish to censor,
one honest greedy miner can include the censored user's high-fee
transaction)
--Solves Zooko's triangle of Secure, Decentralized and Human Meaningful

Full working spec is here: https://github.com/tyzbit/numerifides

I'd love feedback and possible enhancements, as I know this early rough
draft does have a lot of room for improvement (I also think it would be
remiss to incentivize filling blocks with data like this, and a possible
change proposed on the lightning-dev list by ZmnSCPxj is a P2WSH defining
the mapping that is gossiped about outside of the Bitcoin network, but I'd
like to hear all comments).

Thank you for your time.
Tyler Hawkins
