You don?t get bitcoin for being a bitcoin developer, and there is no reason to suppose a developer has any more or less bitcoin than anyone else in the industry.

It is certainly the case that a large number of people and organizations who are not developers hold massive amounts of bitcoin (hundred of thousands each, millions in aggregate).
