While the usability of non-RBF transactions tends to be quite poor, there are some legitimate risk-analysis-based reasons why people use them (eg to sell BTC based on a incoming transaction which you will need to convert to fiat, which has low cost if the transaction doesn't confirm), and if people want to overpay on fees to do so, no reason not to let them, including if the merchant is willing to CPFP to do so.

Honestly, I anticipate very low usage of such a flag, which is appropriate, but also strongly support including it. If things turn out differently with merchants reducing the usability of BTC without taking over the CPFP responsibility we could make the option imply receiver-pays-fee, but no reason to overcomplicate it yet.
