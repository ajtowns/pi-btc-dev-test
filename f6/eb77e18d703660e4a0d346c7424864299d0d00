FWIW my replace-by-fee fork does preferential peering with other RBF
nodes to ensure that you'll always be connected to at least some
full-RBF peers. In practice this works very well, and I'm sure a similar
scheme could be used in this situation as well.

Basically, conceptually unless you're connected to peers that advertise
that they relay the new data, you treat the situation as though you're
not connected to any peers at all. No different than if for some reason
none of your peers were advertising NODE_NETWORK.
