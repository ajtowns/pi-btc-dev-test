FWIW, this is something I've been planning to proposed (in a nicer form) for a 
while, tentatively called a "soft hardfork" (or less-seriously a "softserve 
hardfork"). The big piece missing that I've been holding off on publishing it 
as a BIP until complete, is a planned-out defensive reaction for a community 
which wishes to reject the hardfork. I guess I should probably prioritise this 
a bit more now...
