Sufficient for what, specifically?

Remain valid in the case where the depth assumption is "sufficient" to
ensure that a chain split is not possible?

If this was true (which it is not), it would imply that there is no
reason to validate any block deeper than the most recent 25,000.
Presumably this means that people may continuously rely on some
authority (like Bitcoin Core?) to determine the checkpoint for tip-25,000.

They can only avoid this requirement based on the assumption that the
hard fork cannot result in a chain split. This is not the case.

In other words a "buried deployment" is a hard fork that is not likely
to cause a chain split. This is a subjective subcategory of hard fork,
not an independent category - unless maybe you can show that there is
the 25,000 blocks number is an objective threshold.

This is untrue. The "security assumptions" of Bitcoin do not preclude
deep reorganizations.
