Just keep in mind that if it turns out we need to retrofit messages with
length prefixes I fear we will have to restart with new mime-types. The
nature of prefixes being always at the start means this rules out simply
incrementing a protocol version number.

Correcting myself:

> it might be a good idea to apply this to all messages if any.

Of course I only mean the "root" messages, namely PaymentRequest,
Payment, and PaymentACK. The embedded messages don't need length prefixes.
