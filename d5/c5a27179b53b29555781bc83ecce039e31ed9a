Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 0020: URI Scheme
Message-ID: <1327704664.31621.YahooMailNeo@web121003.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

BIP 0020 is the old URI scheme BIPisized.

ATM it is Draft status.

I do not know enough about the discussion back last year to know whether to move it to Accepted status or not. My feelings are that having a re-decision (even if it was accepted last year) is healthy since it makes no sense to have a standard before a standardisation process existed.

For now, it is Draft status until there's a general agreement.
