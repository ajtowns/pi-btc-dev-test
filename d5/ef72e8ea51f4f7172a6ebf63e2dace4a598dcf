I'm hoping that if we start promoting alternative wallets their dev
communities will get larger. Most bitcoinj code is peer reviewed, but
not to the same extent that Bitcoin-Qt is.

We're obviously not going to stop promoting Bitcoin-Qt as well. I
think the distinction should be:

 * Want to get started fast? Grab MultiBit and you'll be under way in
a couple of minutes.
 * Want to help out the Bitcoin network? Leave your computer switched
on all the time and run Bitcoin-Qt instead. It will donate some of
your computers resources to running the Bitcoin system.

The MultiBit interface is OK but all desktop wallets could use some
love from a friendly UI designer.
