Various issues with bitcoin-qt's qmake build system still...

Regressions remaining on bitcoin-qt branch:
- Building without DBus still tries to use dbus symbols (and fails linking)
- No way to disable SSL support for JSON-RPC
- UPnP is no longer built/enabled by default

These weren't quite working in the old makefiles either, but it was a lot
easier to workaround with DEBUGFLAGS:
- No way to specify include path or library names for bdb and boost
  (won't build, since bdb C++ includes aren't default on many OS)
- No way to build with out-of-tree/system cryptopp or json
