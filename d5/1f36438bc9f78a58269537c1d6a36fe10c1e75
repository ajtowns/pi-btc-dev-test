Generally agreed, though for ZMQ it is a bit different than a P2P service.

IMO, ZMQ really wants to be a plug-in that registers some internal
signals.  It wants to capture the precise points where a block was
accepted internally.  PR #4599 tries to lead by example:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4599

A P2P service would be a slightly different sort of plug-in.
