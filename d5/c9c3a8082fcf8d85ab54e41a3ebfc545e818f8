The ease of implementation is not gained if it's maintained optionally.

I agree changing policy defaults is meaningless, but in this case it
is supposed to signal deprecation of the policy option.

I am in favor of having customizable cost (currently tx size but it
has been proposed to also include sigoprate) and reward (currently
feerate). The main problem I see for keep maintaining the code is that
priority is not integrated in the reward function and cannot easily be
with its current functionality unchanged (which slows down other very
necessary improvements in the mempool limits).
