Nor gained anything. So the "lesser" chain maybe can't trust SPV.
But trusting SPV was already a bad idea anyway.

Note that the parent chain is not in any privileged position here either: a 
merged-mined chain could provide the value to the miner he is interested in, 
while he sees nothing of the parent chain. In short, merged mining is pretty 
much unavoidable in any case.

The basic assumption of SPV is that more people will be assisting rather than 
making invalid blocks. That motive doesn't necessarily need to be economic, 
nor do proper validating clients rely on it. The only real assumption behind 
mining is that the majority will not be aiming to reverse transactions with 
valid blocks.

P.S. How about a Zerocoin with no-reward/PoSacrifice merged mining as well as 
(rewarded) Prime POW; maybe with no subsidy halving, to try a new economic 
idea as well ;)
