No, it depends on all of the variables that go into the mining
profitability equation.

Does miner B have access to cheaper electricity than miner A?
Access to more advanced mining hardware, sooner?
Ability to use excess heat generated from mining productively?
Access to inexpensive labor to oversee their operations?
Access to inexpensive capital to finance investment in hardware?

The number of fee-paying transactions a miner can profitably include in
their blocks will certainly eventually be part of that equation (it is
insignificant today), and that's fantastic-- we WANT miners to include lots
of transactions in their blocks.
