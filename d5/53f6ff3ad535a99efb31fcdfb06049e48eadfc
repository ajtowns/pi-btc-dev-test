If you reject a block based on a particular condition, that is BY DEFINITION 
part of the consensus protocol, and NOT a policy. The protocol is literally 
the set of rules by which blocks are determined to be valid or invalid.

Policies are things that can vary node-to-node without affecting the validity 
judgement of blocks.

Then it doesn't solve the actual problems of either miner spam or growth in 
resource requirements, which are the entire purpose of the block size limit.

Anything that consumes more data than necessary to properly convey the 
intended transfer of value (bitcoins) from one entity to another, including 
all data that is not intended for such a purpose.

Putting group X in control of a limit that exists for the sole purpose of 
restricting group X.

It gives miners complete control over the limit. They can make blocks of any 
size (within the current limit), thus triggering the conditions by which your 
proposal would raise the limit further.
