AFAICT, this would mean that in order for a new node to catch up the filter
index (index all historical blocks), they'd either need to: build up a
utxo-set in memory during indexing, or would require a txindex in order to
look up the prev out's script. The first option increases the memory load
during indexing, and the second requires nodes to have a transaction index
(and would also add considerable I/O load). When proceeding from tip, this
doesn't add any additional load assuming that your synchronously index the
block as you validate it, otherwise the utxo set will already have been
updated (the spent scripts removed).

I have a script running to compare the filter sizes assuming the regular
filter switches to include the prev out's script rather than the prev
outpoint itself. The script hasn't yet finished (due to the increased I/O
load to look up the scripts when indexing), but I'll report back once it's
finished.
