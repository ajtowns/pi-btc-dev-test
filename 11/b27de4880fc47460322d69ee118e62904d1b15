What would be the effect of IBLT on the first seen policy? It seems that
if a miner has to broadcast extra data with his blocks because he's
using full RBF and everyone else is using first-seen then his blocks are
at a disadvantage in terms of propagation. That wouldn't make first-seen
a hard consensus rule, but rather one rational miners are likely to
follow. Or is this effect likely to be minimal?
