The question is answered in the original email.

In the short term, the risk of a Fee Event and lack of solid post-Fee-Event
economic plan implies "short term bump" reduces those risks.

It is also true - as noted in [1], a bump does create the danger of long
term moral hazard.

This is why a bump should be accompanied with at least a weak public
commitment to flexcap or a similar long term proposal, as the original
email recommended.  Communicate clearly the conditions for future change,
then iterate as needs and feedback indicate.
