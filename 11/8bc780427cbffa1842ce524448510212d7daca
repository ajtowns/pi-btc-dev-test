Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Roadmap to getting users onto SPV clients

I think Alan's list of 'what should an ideal first client look like' is
right here.

>From the first time user's perspective if they can get up and running
relatively quickly but still have the safety of a deterministic wallet
then they should have a good first user experience. MultiBit is not
there yet, but BIP32 support is on the roadmap.

If we have a 'shopping list' of what we want in a first client then that
gives me (and others) a list of what to focus on implementing.

Also, as BIP32 support is added to clients and codebases then the actual
variant of software to use to access your wallet will become relatively
less important. Combined with a standardised seed -> passphrase
algorithm the user can just type in their long passphrase into any BIP32
compliant software and click/ buzz/ whirr : there is their wallet. We
should have a little logo for HD wallet compliance ! :-)

As Bitcoin's users become more varied there will be a spectrum of how
'involved' they want to be computationally so we should have offerings
to reflect this.
