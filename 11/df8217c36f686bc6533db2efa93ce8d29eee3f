Well it's not going off-topic since the btc folks need now to find a way
to counter the attack

The disk space story is know to be a non issue, because encouraging
people to run nodes while they don't know how to dedicate the right
storage space that is trivial and not expensive to get today is just
stupid, they should not try to run full nodes, and no I tested with non
SSD drives, I was more wondering about cpu and bandwidth use, but did
not notice any impact, just stopped because a repeated sw bug or drive
issue desynched the chain and bitcoin-qt was trying to reload it from
the begining each time, which in my case was taking 10 days despite of
good bandwidth (which would allow me to torrent the entire chain + state
in less than 20 hours), so I stopped after the 3rd crash, setting up a
full node on my servers is still in the todo list (very low priority for
the reasons already explained)

Running a prune node implies first to setup a full node, so the same
problematic applies and then the advantage of pruning is not really
obvious, I don't know what's the strange story about "archival nodes", I
proposed something else

Back to the topic, the conclusion is that this is not difficult at all
for many people to run efficient full nodes, ideally the community
should promote this, seed a torrent with a recent state, implement a
patch to defeat BU plans and have everybody upgrade

But of course this will not happen
