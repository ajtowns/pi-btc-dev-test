Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Closing issues on github
Message-ID: <CAJNQ0ssW4od3tA5vdASEs4KxZ7-UsxEjWT7NSc0dcWEzrkcH9w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This weekend I closed some old github issues that are no longer
reproducible in more recent versions, or needed input from the submitter
but were stalling for months.

I've also closed some issues that deal purely with Wx UI issues like this
one:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/425

I think my statement is valid, that we no longer support the old UI? Or
maybe some people want to take up maintenance of the old UI? I don't think
that has very high priority, and should probably not be in the main project.

Some of the older issues are absolutely still relevant, but 150+ open
issues is not something to be proud of, and I wonder how other open source
projects deal with this without too much stepping on people's toes :-)
