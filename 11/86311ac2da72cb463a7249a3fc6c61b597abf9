This approach needs a filter set with a lower FP rate. It doesn't
depend on having a high FP rate for privacy (which is good, since
counting on filter false positives seems to more or less fail to
deliver actual privacy in any case.)

Larger filters mean a somewhat higher baseline bandwidth, though when
users do not reuse addresses and have more addresses than there are
txouts in the block the gap is narrower.

This is talking about a committed bloom filter. Not a committed UTXO set.
