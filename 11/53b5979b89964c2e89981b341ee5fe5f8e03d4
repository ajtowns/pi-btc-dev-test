This means zero padding on-chain, which would be undesirable.
Rather "at most" and have the consensus implementation do the padding.

Why?

Lower in what endian? Why only that endian? Why only lower? I can see a 
possible use case where one wants to look at only the high bits to ensure 
their transaction is only valid in a block with at least a certain 
difficulty...
