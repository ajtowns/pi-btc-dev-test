It's a small amount by itself, but miners who are aware of Bounty Payout
Transaction will try to include both these transactions (and both are valid
both on SW and non-SW chains by definition of SW being a soft fork).

If you set timelock of BPT to (H+1) then you sort of discourage this
behavior because a miner of block H might be not the same as miner of block
(H+1), thus he cannot grab this bounty for sure.

Still, there is a chance that same miner will mine both blocks, so
game-theoretically it makes sense to insert SAT into your block since your
expected payoff is positive.

So I'm afraid miners will just grab these bounties regardless of segwit
activation.
