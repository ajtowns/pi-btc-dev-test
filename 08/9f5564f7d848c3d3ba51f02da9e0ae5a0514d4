I do agree about splitting off bitcoincl - it's kinda confusing now how
the client behaves as a rpc daemon or UI when no RPC command-line
parameters are present, and as a command-line client otherwise.

I am less sure UI and RPC should be split (though being able to select
both independently from eachother at compile time would be nice). I
often run the UI and switch to RPC calls to inspect some details.
Not sure how common this usage pattern is, though.

The problem is that bitcoin-qt is built using qmake, and the rest using
makefiles... so it's more than just adding an additional makefile.

That said, it seems bitcoin-qt is mature enough to replace wxbitcoin
to me, and would definitely like to see it in mainline. How streamlined
is the process of building bitcoin-qt on windows and osx? Maybe we can
switch everything to qmake (for now, as long as no maintained autotools 
is present)?
