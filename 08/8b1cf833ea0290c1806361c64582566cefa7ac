You can put assignments on the commandline; for example,

qmake "CONFIG+=test" test.pro

Like in plain make, these variables can be used for conditionally
enabling/disabling libraries or other options in the .pro file.

http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qmake-manual.html

(reminds me that I still need to add the USE_UPNP option)

Note that qmake is a pretty simple tool, optimized for conveniently building
Qt applications in a cross-platform way; it in no way compares to
cmake/autotools or another "full" build system. But it's enough for building
bitcoin-qt on the supported target architectures so that's good enough for
me... For "bitcoind" and "bitcoin-wx" you probably want to keep around the
makefile.
