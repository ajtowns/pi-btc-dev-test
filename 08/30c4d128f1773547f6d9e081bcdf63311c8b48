"My preference would be a bip149 proposal that could be merged and
released now, but some people complain that would require more
testing, because *if you deploy bip149 and then sw gets activated pre
nov15, then you want bip149 nodes to use the old service bit for
segwit*, not the new one (you would use that one if it activates post
nov15, so that pre-bip149 nodes don't get confused)."
(emphasis added)

Why not just make sure BIP 149 will never activate unless BIP 141 has
expired unsuccessfully? If BIP 141 should unexpectly activate, then
BIP 149 nodes would notice and act as pre-SegWit nodes indefinitely,
but remain in consensus with BIP 141 nodes.

It might be slightly less convenient for BIP 149 users to upgrade
again, but then at least we could start deploying BIP 149 sooner.
