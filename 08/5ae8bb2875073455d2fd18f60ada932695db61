Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Many-output transactions in the main chain
Message-ID: <CABsx9T0kBPJfdrKYcp0qHxDRdhYYbAwQ7wuwkwUF97rgSDNnKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Somebody has been inserting transactions with lots of outputs into the
main bitcoin block chain:
  http://blockexplorer.com/block/0000000000000305f98ffbe1db8445ce847fb9a924551945b465386c828f136f

Their next step will be creating transactions with thousands of inputs
from those transactions. The result will be lots of excessive disk
space usage.

The fix is this patch:
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/491

Suggestions on the best way to let merchants, miners, and pools know
about the potential problem?
I hate to take time away from the 0.4 release to re-spin 0.3.24 with
the patch, but we may have to.
