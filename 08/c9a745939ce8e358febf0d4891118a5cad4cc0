I know my reply is a long one but please read before you hit send. I 
have 2 proposals: fast BIP102 + slow SWSF and fast SWSF only. I guess no 
one here is arguing for not doing segwit; and it is on the top of my 
wish list. My main argument (maybe also Jeff's) is that segwit is too 
complicated and may not be a viable short term solution (with the 
reasons I listed that I don't want to repeat)

And also I don't agree with you that BIP102 is *strictly* inferior than 
segwit. We never had a complex softfork like segwit, but we did have a 
successful simple hardfork (BIP50), and BIP102 is very simple. (Details 
in my last post. I'm not going to repeat)
