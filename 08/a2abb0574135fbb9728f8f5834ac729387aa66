Is the small number of bitcoin nodes a concern? If yes, why? What kind of attack can the network suffer? And where can we find statistical information about the full nodes running?

I guess the only effective incentive to keep a node running would be financial. A kind of proof of stake would be nice on bitcoin. But I have no idea how to begin with.
