While BIP91 is probably not terribly harmful, because the vast majority of
nodes and users are prepared for it - the hard fork portion of this BIP is
being deployed like an emergency patch or quick bug fix to the system.

Please consider updating the BIP to include some justification for the
urgency of the consensus change, and the reasons for not delaying until a
better engineered solution (spoonet, BIP103, etc.) can be deployed.
