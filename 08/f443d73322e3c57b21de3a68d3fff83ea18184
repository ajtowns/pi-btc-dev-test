Good morning aj,

I am probably wrong, but could solution 2 be simplified by using the below opcodes for aggregated signatures?

OP_ADD_AGG_PUBKEY - Adds a public key for verification of an aggregated signature.

OP_CHECK_AGG_SIG[VERIFY] - Check that the gathered public keys matches the aggregated signature.

Then:

 pubkey1 OP_ADD_AGG_PUBKEY
 OP_IF
   pubkey2 OP_ADD_AGG_PUBKEY
 OP_ELSE
   cond OP_CHECKCOVENANT
 OP_ENDIF
 OP_CHECK_AGG_SIG

(omitting the existence of buckets)

I imagine that aggregated signatures, being linear, would allow pubkey to be aggregated also by adding the pubkey points (but note that I am not a mathematician, I only parrot what better mathematicians say) so OP_ADD_AGG_PUBKEY would not require storing all public keys, just adding them linearly.

The effect is that in the OP_CHECKCOVENANT case, pre-softfork nodes will not actually do any checking.

OP_CHECK_AGG_SIG might accept the signature on the stack (combined signature of pubkey1 and pubkey2 and from other inputs), or the bucket the signature is stored in.

We might even consider using the altstack: no more OP_ADD_AGG_PUBKEY (one less opcode to reserve!), just push pubkeys on the altstack, and OP_CHECK_AGG_SIG would take the entire altstack as all the public keys to be used in aggregated signature checking.

This way, rather than gathering signatures, we gather public keys for aggregate signature checking.  OP_RETURN_TRUE interacts with that by not performing aggregate signature checking at all if we encounter OP_RETURN_TRUE first (which makes sense: old nodes have no idea what OP_RETURN_TRUE is really doing, and would fail to understand all its details).


I am very probably wrong but am willing to learn how to break the above, though.  I am probably making a mistake somewhere.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
