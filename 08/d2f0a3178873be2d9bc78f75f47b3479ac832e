The attack can be easily hidden. And be sure that before today, today,
and after today, very smart people are at their computer planning attacks
on Bitcoin. Exploits must be published and fixed FAST.

Nevertheless, I agree  that, as you say, we must not rush it. Look at the
BIP, find if we missed anything, and let's discuss it.

Not really. Please see the discussion section in our paper.

There is no flaw. You were just reiterating that the solution does not give
us the 51% percent security you thought you had before. We showed that
we're not getting this back, I'm afraid.

Best,
