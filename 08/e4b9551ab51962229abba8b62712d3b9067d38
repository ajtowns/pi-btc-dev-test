Subject: [Bitcoin-development] A suggestion for reducing the size of the
	UTXO database

Actually your assumption is wrong. Bitcoin Wallet (and I think most, if
not all, other bitcoinj based wallets) picks UTXO by age, in order to
maximize priority. So it keeps the number of UTXOs low, though not as
low as if it would always pick *all* UTXOs.
