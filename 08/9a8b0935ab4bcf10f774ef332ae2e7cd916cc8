Assuming t_0 is negligible is wrong in this case. Or, it should be...

So alpha has units of seconds/byte, which lets us indirectly figure out
the bandwidth the blocks are propagating at assuming t_0=0 and all links
are equal. When you realize that P_fork is basically a multiplier on the
bandwidth required to get a block out fast enough, the derivation makes
sense. In any case we get:

alpha = (1/113)*600s/134kBytes = 39.62uS/byte = 24kB/second

Which is atrocious... but when you remember that Bitcoin nodes send
blocks to all peers simultaneously,(1) thus dividing up the bandwidth and
ruining latency you see why. t_0 shouldn't be at all negligible due to
speed of light, but with this low bandwidth it is anyway.

1) To be precise, nodes answer queries for blocks from all peers
simultaneously.

This also indicates that pools haven't taken the simple step of peering
with each other using high-bandwidth nodes with restricted numbers of
peers, which shows you how little attention they are paying to
optimizing profits.  Right now mining pulls in $1.8 million/day, so
that's up to $16k wasted.

However, because miners don't orphan themselves, that $16k loss is born
disproportionately by smaller miners... which also means the 24kB/sec
bandwidth estimate is wrong, and the real number is even worse. In
theory anyway, could just as easily be the case that larger pools have
screwed up relaying still such that p2pool's forwarding wins.
