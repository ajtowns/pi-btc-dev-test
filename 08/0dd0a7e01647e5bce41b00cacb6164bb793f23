Yes I've had a couple other people point that out to me as well and the
logic is sound. Unfortunately that doesn't help solve the actual issue that
mining is currently consolidated within the jurisdiction of a single
political body that is not exactly Bitcoin friendly. I don't know how to
solve that issue aside from pointing it out and hoping miners outside of
China point to different pools and build more farms in smaller countries.
Venezuela for example has cheap electricity and could be a good place to
mine. Iceland too.
