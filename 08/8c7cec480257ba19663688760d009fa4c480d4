I'm not talking about changing the protocol - I'm talking about the 
business relationships between users of Bitcoin.

I would expect a payment processor to inform the merchants of relevant 
double spends that it observes on the network, even if the payment is 
actually successful, so that the merchant can decide for themselves 
whether or not to pursue it out of band.

Mining is a kind of technical fallback that allows the network to 
resolve human misbehavior without human intervention. If nobody ever 
attempted to make a fraudulent payment, we wouldn't need mining at all 
because the signed transaction itself is proof of intention to pay. That 
it exists doesn't suddenly make fraud less fraudulent and mean that 
users who are in a position to pursue out of band recourse shouldn't do 
so.

I agree that there are valid reasons for replacing transactions in the 
mempool, I just think they should be implemented in a way that doesn't 
facilitate fraud.

I'd also like to note that "prima facie" doesn't mean "always", it means 
that "the default assumption, unless proven otherwise."
