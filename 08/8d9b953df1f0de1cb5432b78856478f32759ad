Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Request For Discussion / BIP number -
 Multi-Currency Hierarchy For Use In Multisignature Deterministic Wallets
Message-ID: <5524D347.4040507@maza.club>

I have a potential BIP, "Multi-Currency Hierarchy For Use In
Multisignature Deterministic Wallets." I'm requesting discussion on it,
and possibly assignment of a BIP number.

It's located in this github gist:
