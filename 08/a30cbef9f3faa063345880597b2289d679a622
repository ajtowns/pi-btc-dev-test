The more specific answer (from a user's perspective) is that there is 
unanimous approval within the constraints of the Bitcoin system.  The 
constraint is that your software must be compatible with merchants and 
exchanges for your coins to have value.  Stating "unanimous approval" 
without identifying the constraint is misstating the issue.

As for developers, the consensus on code changes are almost never 100% 
and someone has to make the decision about what is an a acceptable 
consensus.  Most of the cultish answers completely overlook this issue 
even though it is main point of the question.
