It's a bit of a made up term, but when Russel said "pinned" it refers to a child transaction that was made  (i.e. in this case by Alice) and for us to replace our transaction we need to "unpin" it.

However to unpin it, the current bip125 rules require you pay not only the relay of the transactions you're throwing away, but the absolute fee. This is general is cost prohibitive, as even a normalish transaction can be spending $20 in fees. 

Also FWIW this whole idea of T_a and T_ab  is good, but it's also pretty impractical at the moment due to the sheer amount complexity it introduces (i.e. monitoring, seeing which confirms, trying to rebroadcast the missing one in a way that is safe against reorgs, blah blah).

If you use estimatesmartfee you should be able to get estimates all the way to 1008 or something btw

I agree.

This would definitely work for some specific use-case. For instance currently if you do n replacements of a transaction, each time adding an additional output .. you need to pay something like O(n^2) relay fee. If you used a diff instead, you could probably get it to O(n)ish. 

But relay fee (and n) at the moment, mean it's not a big deal at all. The big flaw (imo) in bip125 is that you need to pay the absolute fee from the transactions you are evicting. And that can be from transactions you didn't even generate yourself.  We can already compactly represent the diff  (the new transaction invalidates it)  the debate is more "Should you have to pay the absolute fee or just relay fee for the stuff you invalidate"
