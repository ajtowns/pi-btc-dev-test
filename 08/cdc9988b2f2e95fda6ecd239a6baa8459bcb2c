Pot is used as money, and they do jail people for it, but it doesn't have
the effect to which you refer. It has the opposite effect, partially
because it enriches suppliers.

The 51% attack is a good point, but they would be taking a huge risk.
Ideas don't die, just people.  For example, they got Ross Ulbricht, not DPR.

Government is the group of people that does things that are not acceptable
if anyone else does them, and that is because people cheer for them when
they do those things, rather than pointing out that they are not
acceptable.  The movie "The Deep Web" shows how bitcoin helps to turn this
misfortune around.
