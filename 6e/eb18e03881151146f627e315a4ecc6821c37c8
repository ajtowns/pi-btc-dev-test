Accepted CAs is/should be a property of your *operating system*, not any 
particular software. Anyhow, restricting this further just makes it even more 
unusable. Already there is only 1 or 2 CAs that will provide a gratis 
certificate for personal/small users. If you only allow high-class CAs, I 
imagine that will restrict "no key in the URI" aliases to those who will fork 
over a lot of money.
