There are many colored coin protocols in use. OpenAssets is probably the
most popular one, but it has many critical flaws IMHO.

The protocol is not a work-in-progress, it is already in use, you cannot
change it without breaking stuff.
The doc can be improved, though. There is a lot of fluff but the actual
important stuff gets just few ambiguous sentences.

I hope it does continue to get worked on, though. The lack of response or

The original author, Flavien, have abandoned it, he now does a private
blockchain thing, OpenChain.
There are others who still use OpenAssets, e.g. Nicolas, but the protocol
can't be changed.

There are other colored coin protocols in existence/in development, though.
