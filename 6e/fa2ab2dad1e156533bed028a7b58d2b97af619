I run a number of high speed nodes and while I don't have historical
logs handy over time, I've noticed a drop from about %5-%10 SPV clients
at any one time to closer to %1 (Matt: you have a few TB of logs saved
don't you?)

Also, as I mentioned, just look at the popularity of wallets such as
Mycelium that are not adopting bloom filters, but going with SPV
verification of block headers w/ lookup servers.

Anyway, look at the analogous implementation of NODE_GETUTXO's, which
helpfully has provided the infrastructure for wallets that need bloom
filters to find appropriate nodes to connect too - we certainely aren't
seeing any shortages of nodes for those wallets to use.
