I'd be happy with a sort of BitTorrent like snubbing, and dropping in
extreme cases.
Sharing blacklist decisions would be dangerous. We could even extend the
protocol to include some sort of choking/unchoking in order to warn peers
that we might drop him if he continues to misbehave.

In general I think that we have to be careful in what we consider
misbehaving, it should be really conservative to begin with, and extend the
rules over time. Making them too restrictive might make future development
difficult, not to speak of alternative clients.

Regards,
Chris
