Are we looking at the same list? Because here is the order I added: Bitcoin-Qt, Armory, Electrum and MultiBit. Maybe try CTRL-F5 to force a refresh of your browser.

Also about the descriptions: yeah I know. I think it's better to put this up first and then have everyone submit their own descriptions and screenshots. Otherwise it'll be a nightmare to coordinate until everything is perfect. I did message you on IRC today but maybe you were offline.

I didn't copy paste the Armory description from the website because it really sounds too spammy like a sales pitch. Here I was trying to give an even handed balanced overview of all the clients. For each client I was trying to empaphise a 'theme'. Bitcoin-Qt is stability. Armory is advanced. Electrum is convenient. MultiBit is ease of use.

Hey, looks good! ?I'm glad to see them sorted alphabetically :)

A couple comments: ?I don't think the entries for "wallet security" and "backups" accurately describe Armory. ?Wallet Security should say "Encrypt/Offline" or something to to that effect -- after all, offline wallets are the holy grail feature of the Armory. ?And backups should say something like "One-time Printable" if it fits within the box. ?

Otherwise, I really like the layout and design. ?Although despite the fact I enjoy being first on the list, I think Bitcoin-Qt should still go first. ?It is the "reference" client, and I think it's relevant that it is the "de-facto" client for the majority of users, and the one with the most quality control and stability.
