Would be nice if you could help test (and use?) the pull request for system 
LevelDB support: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2241
Note that you should be careful to tie your port to the specific LevelDB 
version bundled, to avoid any risk of unexpected hardforking bugs or fixes in 
upstream LevelDB.

For the other patches, please try to find a portable solution (if they aren't 
already) and open pull requests on github.

Thanks,

Luke
