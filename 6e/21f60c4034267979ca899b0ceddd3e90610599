Not sure - it could be investigated. I think UPNP is an entirely
userspace-implementable protocol, so in theory it could be done by a
userspace library (even libminiupnp - java is not a requirement on android)

I suspect you mean "I think lots of people do that". I'm not so sure. We
could potentially run an experiment in the Android app to measure how many
users are in a position to contribute back, but just because you have wifi
doesn't mean you can reconfigure it using UPnP. That helps a lot in home
networks, but at the office it doesn't help.

I'm wary of a ton of work being put in to achieve not very much here.
Satoshi's original vision was always that millions of users were supported
by 100,000 or so nodes. I don't think that's unreasonable over the long
term.

Besides, prioritisation isn't very hard. Nodes can just hand clients a
signed timestamp which they remember. When re-connecting, the signed
timestamp is handed back to the node and it gives priority to those with
old timestamps. No state is required on the node side. Signing and checking
can be passed onto the general ECDSA thread pool that works its way through
pending signature operations, they'd be prioritised lower than checking
blocks/broadcasts.
