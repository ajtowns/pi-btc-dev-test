I prefer to make robust arguments; if I can start with accepting that
95% of what my opponents say is true, yet still end up being correct,

My personal opinion is that what Mastercoin has started will turn the

of the underlying ideas come from that team. But there's nothing
surprising about that - when was the last time you used Netscape
Navigator, let alone NCSA Mosaic?
