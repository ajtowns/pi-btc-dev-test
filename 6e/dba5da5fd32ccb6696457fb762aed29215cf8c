By that reasoning, we also shouldn't go to https://coinbase.com or
https://kraken.com to buy any bitcoins? As a MITM can redirect the site
_if_ they obtain the coinbase or kraken certificate.

Obviously, HTTPS is secured under the assumption that certificates are
secure.  

Using the payment protocol simply means paying to a secure endpoint (eg
https://tomasvdw.nl/pay) instead of an address.

So we should not use HTTPS for secure transfer because the
implementation may not be good enough? This incorrectly conflates
implementation with specification. There is nothing stopping a developer
from using a proper implementation.

Currently it is widely used by merchants, but not yet for light clients
_receiving_ money. If it becomes more wide spread,   it offers a range
of advantages as  the bitcoin-address of the URI can and should be
deprecated (made impossible with "h="). A payment address just becomes a
secure endpoint.

This means no more address reuse is possible. Also, it drops the need
for mempool synchronization among non-miners, solely as a "notification"
mechanism. In addition it means light clients know exactly when a
transaction is coming in, so they can efficiently rely on client-side
filtering a small set of blocks, improving their privacy.

In my opinion, the payment protocol is key to scaling.

Sorry, but maybe you  could explain better how secure communication over
HTTPS is "very dangerous"? I think some websites would like to know :)
