The protocol version was bumped when Bloom filtering was added so there's
not much point bumping it again - you have to handle the old clients no
matter what. Nobody brought this up as an issue when the BIP or code was
first written and as you can see from main.cpp, it was done this way to be
consistent with how other version fields are handled:

        if (!vRecv.empty())
            vRecv >> addrFrom >> nNonce;
        if (!vRecv.empty())
            vRecv >> pfrom->strSubVer;
        if (!vRecv.empty())
            vRecv >> pfrom->nStartingHeight;
        if (!vRecv.empty())
            vRecv >> pfrom->fRelayTxes; // set to true after we get the
first filter* message

The existence of the nStartingHeight field for instance depends on the
message length and not anything else.

Anyway, are you really asking for the protocol to be changed to work around
an issue specific to how you wrote your parsing code? This is the first
time anyone has suggested this minor detail is a problem. It doesn't
present any issues for the C++ code or bitcoinj where message objects know
their own length at parse time.
