1. Right now you practically need a unique Bitcoin address per transaction.
2. DNSSEC is on the edge of becoming illegal in the US.
3. Emails aren't merely domains.

I would propose something like resolving foo at bar.net to a SRV lookup for 
_bitcoinaddressresolution._tcp.foo.bar.net, expecting a cert for bar.net, 
making a HTTPS request for /bitcoinaddressresolution?foo at bar.net, and also 
sending an email to foo at bar.net (the usual way) signed with the keys used for 
the transaction. ;)
