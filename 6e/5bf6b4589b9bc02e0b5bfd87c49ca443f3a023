You mean an isolated signing device without memory right? 

An isolated node would still know the transactions substantiating its coins, why would it sign them away to fees ?

In such an attack, the relay rules aren't relevant, and if the attacker can DoS you for 24 hours, it doesn't take a ton of mining power to make the attack extremely likely to succeed.
