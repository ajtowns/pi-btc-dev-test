Big picture/mid-term I think air-gaps and zero-trust ecosystem components
are the only solution.  (zero-trust meaning like real-time auditability, or
type 2/type 3 exchanges based on atomic-swap, trustless escrow etc).

Need a mass-production and air-drop of trezors :)

There is one more problem address-substitution via untrusted network/user
and weak site with 1mil lines of swiss-cheese security app-store.  So some
kind of address authentication TOFU.  Aside from X509 bloatware which could
be extended from payment protocol to do that, I'd argue for a native simple
TOFU format like Alan Reiner's multiplier * base approach (where base is the
TOFU handle).  And/or something like the IBE address proposal (which gives a
bandwidth efficiently SPV queryable way to check if funds received).  Worst
case if weil-pairing gets broken it auto-devolves to the current status
quo.

Btw not to reignite the stealth vs reusable address bike shedding, but
contrarily I was thinking it maybe actually better to try to rebrand address
as "invoice number".  People understand double paying an invoice is not a
good idea.  And if they receive the same invoice twice they'll query it.
