hmm? if the current ask for 1 ounce of gold is 100$, then you need to bid
100$ to get 1 ounce of gold. If tomorrow everyone agree 1ounce of gold
should be worth 200$, then the bid moves accordingly. of course production
changes based on prices. otherwise the economy would not function. if price
of some stuff goes up, more people produce that stuff. in terms of a price
for a transaction and the use of a blockchain, unfortunately there is not a
way to just add computational supply. that's an inherent weakness of how
blockchains are structured. ideally it would be as simple as demanding more
resources as in scaling a webservices with AWS.
