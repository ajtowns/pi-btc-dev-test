Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Wallet nLockTime best practices
Message-ID: <CAJHLa0Md-fnYFHqVhPGizdofm-8Ly6aZxN+u3EVkyNJ4B5BWeg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm inclined to merge https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2340

which sets nLockTime on wallet-created transactions by default.  I
think this is good practice for wallets, long term.
