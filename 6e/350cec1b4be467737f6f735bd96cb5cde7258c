I think the "Kill King Bitcoin - Long Live the King" call is somewhat
inevitable, and we should expect this to happen from time-to-time, now that
the cat is out of the bag.

However, I fully agree with Adam that livenet is probably not the place to
play this game, and I'm also not convinced that testnet is either.

I often wondered if there is any appetite for a no-holds-barred, anything
goes, bitcoin fork that would allow for the kind of valuable
experimentation that Peter R is suggesting? This is a different concept
than an alt-coin because it would be undoubtedly unstable until consensus
is reached - and that is the whole idea. It hopefully would inform future
decisions about what gets rolled into Core. One problem I see with doing
this, is the lack of incentive.
