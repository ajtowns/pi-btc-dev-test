It has come to my attention maintaining the current priority algorithm is not 
even expensive, so I think I'm inclined to NACK using starting priority 
altogether. Since I am the mining maintainer for Core, I believe it's 
reasonable for me to decide on maintenance tradeoffs...

Therefore, my goal in this matter will be to review #6357 in depth to be 
merged, and follow up with #6898 based on the current default policies.

This is a bad idea anyway, since priority is the best metric we have right now 
for ensuring legitimate transactions get mined despite spam attacks.
