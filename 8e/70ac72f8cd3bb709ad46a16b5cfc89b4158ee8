Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: Requiring a miner's signature
	in the block header
Message-ID: <CABT1wWnU9mq-AV_oPSLRNsSj_7r5iXQPspHvPJki0_vUMStgLA@mail.gmail.com>

A similar idea was proposed by Sirer and me as a part of two-phase proof of
work (2P-PoW) [1]. In 2P-PoW the first phase is Bitcoin's standard PoW and
the second phase requires the signature. This way Bitcoin doesn't lose its
mining power (read: security) in one day, but rather it is possible to
gradually switch from the current PoW to the signature-based one, slowly
phasing out the existing hardware and mining datacenters.

For a more general view of nonoutsourceable puzzles you can check out
Miller et al.'s paper [2].
