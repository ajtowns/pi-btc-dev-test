It has been tested in git for almost half a year. This RC is the first binary

It is extremely unlikely that the wallet will eat your coins (always backup
nevertheless), but I can't guarantee there won't be some issue where the wallet
and chain get out of sync and you're forced to redownload the blockchain.
