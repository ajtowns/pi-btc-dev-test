Thanks Peter,

Having tried to write a bug-for-bug compatible code with Satoshi, I can only second that it is rather close to impossible. 

The aim of BIP62 is noble, still it does not feel right for me to increase the complexity of the code with e.g. soft-fork-ready versioning.
Freezing the consensus code, studying its bugs appears more appropriate to me. What we learn could define a hard fork or a better
chain we migrate to as discussed by blockstream.
