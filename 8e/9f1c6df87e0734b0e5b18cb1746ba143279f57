I imagine the BIP16 supporters would say the same?  Isn't that the essence of 
the current impasse?

My suggestion is backward compatible.  You'd only have to make version2 
transactions for version2 addresses; and the join between version1 and 
version2 is not a problem since the version1 source can be detected, and the 
handling of the version2 transaction altered as appropriate (it's only a 
matter of switching from the hash check to running the two scripts as 
normal).
