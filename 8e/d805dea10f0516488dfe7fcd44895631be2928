A mining pool is not a person, a full node is not a miner, and
cooperation is not control.

The entire Bitcoin ecosystem cooperates, that is what consensus means.
Establishing proof of that cooperation is the purpose of Bitcoin.

Decentralization is about keeping control out of the hands of the state
(any entity that would substitute violence for consensus). Nobody has
the power to compel the cooperation of individual miners in a pool. When
state power is applied to a pool operator the miners (people) retain
their vote.
