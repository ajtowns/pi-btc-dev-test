Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 32 HD wallets,
	accounts should be labels not numbers

Can this be amended? I think it makes much more sense to allow people to input labels not numbers at this level.

General category names for different accounts is much more human than numbers, and you can still use incrementing numbers if you prefer.
