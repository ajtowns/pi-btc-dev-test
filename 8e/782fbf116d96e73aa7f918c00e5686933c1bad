You are not going to get a fair fee market if your only form of enforcement is the threat of exclusion.

A more fair fee market will develop if miners start offering quality of service, preferably at multiple tiers. At that point any interference from a block size cap will only be detrimental. In fact it will only highlight what the cap is actually for; to prevent monster blocks. 

Add better QoS tools for miners and extend the cap (when possible) and there's your fee market.

We can do this - we can overcome this obstacle?we can find good solutions to a fee market. Unless someone can come up with another way to pay for the operation of the network, we NEED to do this. What makes anyone think it will be easier to do later rather than now? The longer we wait, the lower block rewards get, the larger the deployed infrastructure, the larger our userbase, the HARDER it will be to solve it. We should solve it now - we will be much better off for it?and so will our users.

Increasing the block size right now will, in all likelihood, delay this effort. I?d much prefer to first let the fee market evolve because it?s a crucial component to the protocol?s design and its security model?and so we can get a better sense for fee economics. Then we might be able to figure out better approaches to block size changes in the future that makes sense economically?perhaps with mechanisms that can dynamically adjust it to reflect resource availability and network load.
