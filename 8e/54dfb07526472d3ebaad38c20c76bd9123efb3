Interestingly, Blockchain's android wallet is based on Android Wallet /
bitcoinj.  So with HD in bitcoinj we would get Multibit, Android Wallet
(Andreas Schildbach's) and remove one roadblock to Blockchain going HD.
Electrum HD seems more or less ready.  So I'm optimistic that we'll see
a pretty fast transition to HD for the majority of the user base.

HD is important for some multisig flows, including the watchdog type
where you want to detect change going back to the wallet.

We have a proposed flow for watchdog type multisig
here:

https://cryptocorp.co/technology.htm

and a reference implementation off the Electrum 2.0 branch.

It actually works just like a regular spend from a UX point of view,
unless the watchdog decides that it needs a second factor for a risky
transaction.  With a risky transaction, the user just gets a
callback or enters an OTP.
