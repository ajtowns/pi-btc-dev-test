I think the main thing you're missing is that there will always be
transactions available to mine simply because demand for blockspace is
effectively unbounded as fees approach 0. Nodes generally have a
static mempool size and dynamic minrelaytxfee nowadays so as
transactions get mined lower fee transactions get accepted into the
mempool. An individual opting to not send a transaction would not make
the blocks smaller simply because there will always be other
transactions available(it would really only have an effect on the
transaction fees needed to get mined).
