I'm providing some perspective and scope-- referencing again your
comment about following actions-- what element of the many dozens of
responses suggests to you that _anyone_ is not being listened to?

While I'm sure its not intended; your selective editing ends up
butchering the meaning---- I pointed out that there have been
disputes, even ones involving regular contributors (and, implicitly,
that I'm not lying by omission in not mentioning that the dispute was
a joke or from someone well known to attack Bitcoin) or-- in other
words, evidence that the disagreement was not less meaningful than
what you're talking about here. That's all, sorry I was unclear again.

Did you see in my message that I invited you to take a look for
examples-- I think they're easily found and you would find it
informative. I really recommend spending some time looking.
