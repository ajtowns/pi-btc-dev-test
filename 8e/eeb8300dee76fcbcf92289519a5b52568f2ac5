I think you can work around this to some extent by "batching" signing
requests.

(Background:

For interactive multisignatures (threshold or not), the protocol is:

   produce secret nonce r, calculate public nonce R=r*G
   everyone shares H(R)
   everyone shares R, checks received values match received hashes
   everyone calculates s=r+H(R',P',m)*p, shares s

For deterministic nonces, you generate r=H(p,m) based on the message
being signed and your private key, so can only start this process when
you start signing, and the sharing rounds mean interactivity.

)

But you don't strictly need deterministic nonces, you just have to never
use the same nonce with a different message. If you arrange to do that
by keeping some state instead, you can calculate nonces in advance:

phase 1:
    produce secret nonces r1..r1024, calculate R1..R1024
    share H(R1)..H(R1024)

phase 2:
    store other parties hashes, eg as H1..H1024
    share R1..R1024

phase 3:
    check received nonces match, ie H(R1)=H1, etc

phase 4:
    request to sign msg m, with nonce n
    if nonce n has already been used, abort
    mark nonce n as having being used
    lookup other signer's nonces n and sum them to get R'
    calculate s = rn + H(R',P',m)*p
    share s

That way you could do phases 1-3 once, and then do 1024 signatures during
the month on whatever your current timetable is.

You could also combine these phases, so when you get a signing request you:

   * receive msg to sign m, n=4; everyone else's R4, H(R5)

   * check  H(R4) = previously received "H(R4)"
   * calculate R4' by summing up your and everyone's R4s
   * bump state to n=5
   * do the signature...

   * send sig=(s,R4), R5, H(R6)

which would let you have an untrusted app that does the coordination and
shares the nonces and nonce-hashes, and getting all the needed air-gapped
communication in a single round. (This is effectively doing phase 3 and
4 for the current signature, phase 2 for the next signature, and phase
1 for the signature after that all in one round of communication)

That seems almost as good as true non-interactivity to me, if your signing
hardware is capable of securely storing (and updating) a few kB of state
(which is probably not quite as easy as it sounds).
