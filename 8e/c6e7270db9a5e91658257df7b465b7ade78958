I prefer not to do anything that requires pools software upgrade or wallet upgrade. So I prefer to keep the dummy marker, and not change the commitment structure as suggested by another post.

For your second suggestion, I think we should keep scriptSig empty as that should be obsoleted. If you want to put something in scriptSig, you should put it in witness instead.

Maybe we could restrict witness to IsPushOnly() scriptPubKey, so miners can?t put garbage to legacy txs. But I think relaxing the witness program size to 73 bytes is enough for any purpose.
