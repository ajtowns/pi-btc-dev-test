Subject: [bitcoin-dev] [BIP-draft] CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY - An opcode for
 relative locktime (Btc Drak)
Message-ID: <CA+1nnrmkEGHY7HwffbQ4sEG_c2EhCbVK64FtGXSERpGdsxoQZA@mail.gmail.com>

Would be wonderful to have this pushed together with CLTV and BIP68.
If BIP68 get pushed in the next fork, this CSV is a no brainer.

Was there a competing RCLTV implementation somewhere that did not depend on
BIP68 for information ? I don't manage to find it.
