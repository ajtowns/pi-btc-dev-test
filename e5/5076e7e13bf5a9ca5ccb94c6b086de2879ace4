There are no logfiles for DNS requests.

I just checked on EC2 and my cellphone internet connection here in Tel
Aviv; both work fine. My best guess is that your DNS resolver locally or
at your ISP is unable to deal with the fact that the second DNS seed
serving the domain testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org happens to be down
right now. Note that some ISP's appear to both run buggy DNS servers,
and redirect traffic meant to go to Google's 8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 DNS
servers to their own servers.

I'd suggest that someone setup an alternate HTTP(S) based DNS seed for
protocol redundency.

Dunno exactly. It appeared to be running fine when I logged into the
machine, but for whatever reason DNS requests just weren't getting
resolved. Restarted and it was ok again.
