Message-ID: <CADToNK93kmXjwSAxj3WcPSYgq2uReVNJSpX1a5M7DMzgjgv5vA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Is there any client or code that currently implements BIP 100? And how will
it be deployed? WIll the initial fork be deployed in the same manner that
the max block size changes are deployed described in the bip?

Thanks
