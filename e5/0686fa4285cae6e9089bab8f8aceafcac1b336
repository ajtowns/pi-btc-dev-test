Besides ASIC-proof being even tehoretically impossible, assuming we had a PoW 
that worked using mere RAM-as-the-ASIC, this would probably not be good in 
the long term for decentralisation, as it is only a matter of time until 
botnets would bankrupt all the legitimate miners out of operation.

Restarting the mining with a new algorithm as a reaction and defence against 
centralised hoarding of mining ASICs (as we are seeing now), would be 
acceptable. It would not necessarily be contentions *to the economy*, as such 
hoarding-miners do not participate in the economy in any meaningful way (they 
do not accept payments from other bitcoin users).
