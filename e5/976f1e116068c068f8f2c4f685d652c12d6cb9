Maybe I am confused but I thought you are using DNSSEC to sign the zones 
so only the domain owner could issue certificates for a zone (or 
corresponding email address).  If you have "example.com" the domain 
owner of the domain would sign zone "joe.example.com" which can 
correspond to the "joe at example.com" email address.  Under this scenario 
you would only have one CA per domain.
