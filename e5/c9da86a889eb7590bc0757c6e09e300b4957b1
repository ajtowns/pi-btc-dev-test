Given that this has a very minimal cost for spammers - just a single satoshi -
I don't think this is worth the risk of making future upgrades more complex as
other posters have brought up.

Secondly, I think we have good reason to think that things like my own TXO
commitments and Bram's related work will make UTXO growth a non-issue in the
future.

So, I'd NACK such a proposal myself.
