Nice work! I can confirm that this dev binary runs smoothly in the 
latest version of Tails, v1.0. Screenshot proof here [1]. When this is 
incorporated into the next release of Bitcoin Core, will this make the 
usual Linux binary compatible, or will there be a special binary just 
for systems running the older Qt?
