I meant to say "I find it hard to understand why a full node that does
initial block
download also must download witnesses when it is going to skip verification
of the witnesses anyway."

I'm referring to the "assumevalid" feature of Bitcoin Core that skips
signature verification up to block X. Or have I misunderstood assumevalid?
