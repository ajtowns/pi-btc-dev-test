One doesn't use this opcode as the sole thing to secure a transaction.
Instead this opcode prevents double spend attacks against
anonymization schemes. The idea is for Alice to give signatures to the
recipients of funds, all signatures being equivalent. To avoid this
from leading to a double-spend, we use a quorum method based on
showing earlier redemptions happened.

Because you can't blind a lamport signature, it isn't. I'm searching
for a place to post the current draft: it's not ready for anything
official yet, but does seem to be of interest. Drop me a (offlist)line
if you have ideas about where I can put  it.
Sincerely,
