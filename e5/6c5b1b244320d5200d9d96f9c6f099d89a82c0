Which is why, as pointed out several times at 30c3 by several renowned
figures, why cryptography has remained squarely outside of mainstream use.
It needs to just work and until you can trust the connection and what the
end point sends you, automatically, it's a big fail and the attack vectors
are many.

a download... </sarcasm>
