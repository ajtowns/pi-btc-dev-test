The main benefit is that you don't need "standard" to solve problem, but
use natural tools in given environment and programming stack. Build a
"standard" on top of URI protocol is a huge limitation, which does not give
any advantage.

We already see issues with dead simple "bitcoin uri" standard, it barely
works in most of bitcoin apps. Think of vague definitions of parameters or
ability to send payment requests over it. HW API would be complicated by an
order of magnitude and I have serious concerns that it will be helpful for
anything. So why complicate things.

the only supported hardware communication layer?

Interprocess communication/libraries/dependencies on Android are not bound
to specific transport anyhow. Such library could be used by any android
app, and the library would implement proper transports for various
supported vendors. USB for Trezor, NFC for something different etc. If the
point is "make life of app developers easier", let's do this and do not
define artifical "standards".
