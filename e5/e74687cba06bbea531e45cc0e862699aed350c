Whoops, I didn't mean to run us down the Quantum Computing debate path. 
I was simply using my experience with QCs as a basis for questioning the
conclusion that ECDLP is so much more robust than RSA/factoring
problems.  It's possible we would simply be jumping from one burning
bridge to another burning bridge by rushing to convert everything to ECC
in the event of a factoring breakthrough.

>From the perspective of quantum computers, it seems those two problems
are essentially the same.  As I said, I remember that one of the
problems is solved by using the solution/circuit for the other.  But I
don't know if this relationship holds outside the realm of QCs.   The
guy who did this presentation said he's not a mathematician and/or
cryptographer, yet he still strongly asserts the superiority of ECDLP. 
I'm not convinced.
