Try paying a consultant if your ego demands that you have a technical
expert to entertain your musing with immediate response.

My response was absolutely relevant.

If you reissue a transaction without respending the prior transactions
coins, you will end up double paying. Only spending the inputs in
question can prevent the prior transaction (itself or in other form)
from going through.

Once you respend the inputs there is no risk of actually losing funds
due to an issue regardless of how you track coins in your higher level
application.
