When considering "too conservative" options, let's not forget that,
say, scheduling 2MB for 2020 doesn't preclude us from deciding that
was too conservative and schedule, say 4MB for 2018 later. The first
hardfork would be "useless", but it would set a "minimum increase"
that would have been useful if the second one never happened.

To be clear, for this concrete case block.nTime would just work just
fine. I just want us to decide on one of the options and uniformly
recommend that options for all cases in BIP99 [just renamed the file,
https://github.com/jtimon/bips/blob/bip-forks/bip-0099.org ].
But, yes, please, let's discuss this in the other thread.
