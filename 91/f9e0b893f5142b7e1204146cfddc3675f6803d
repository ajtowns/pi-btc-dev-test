I also thought about this some time ago. But note that this implies
that forks grow with the same block frequency as the main chain. Thus
the longest chain rule becomes irrelevant, since all chains will have
the same length (in expectancy). Rather, the chain with most work is
the true one.

I am not necessarily advocating it - just putting it out for discussion. While the downside is that it could permanently split the network, the upside is that it could heap additional pressure on miners to follow the BIP148 chain and ensure a minimally disruptive upgrade. This is pure game theory.

MR POWA would mean BIP148 miners would no longer need to ?hold their nerve? as they would be guaranteed a viable chain and rewarded for their early support.
