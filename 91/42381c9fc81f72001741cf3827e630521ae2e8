For the record, I think the idea of the bips repo being a pure publication
platform isn't a good one and doesn't match reality; like it or not by
accepting bips we're putting a stamp of some kind of approval on them.

For example, I suspect I wouldn't be able to get a BIP for a decentralized
assassination market protocol standard into the repository, regardless of
whether or not it was used - it's simply too distastful and controversial for
us to want to merge that. Would you call that rejection censorship?

I have zero issues with us exercising editorial control over what's in the bips
repo; us doing so doesn't in any way prevent other's from publishing elsewhere.
