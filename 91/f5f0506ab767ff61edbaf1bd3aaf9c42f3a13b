Good point. If NG is layered on top of Bitcoin, we'd retain all of Bitcoin
as is. This would confer all the benefits of Bitcoin's retrospective
blocks, as well as add the ability to mint microblocks with low latency in
between. And despite the phrase "the leader," the actual leader in NG is a
key, not a specific node. That makes it possible to deter DDoS attacks by
dynamically migrating where in the network the leader is operating in
response to an attack. Finally, DDoS attacks against miners are already
possible, but they seem rare, and I suspect it's at least partly because of
the success of Matt Corallo's high speed bitcoin relay network. Similar
defenses can apply here.
