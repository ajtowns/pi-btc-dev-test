Then at least you are not using the same word for two different meanings
and you're using stuff more familiar in popular lexicon.
I dont think it's helpful for users if we use the word "blocks".

"Confirmations" in a numeric context isn't correct, though. We're using to it 
because we've been using Bitcoin so long, but to the average person they would 
expect it to mean something more than it is. If not referring to blocks, then 
perhaps "witnessed N times"?

Why not call it "Clearing" for transactions with < 6 confirmations and "Cleared" for >= 6?
?
The round ticker should be enough of an indication of the progress.
