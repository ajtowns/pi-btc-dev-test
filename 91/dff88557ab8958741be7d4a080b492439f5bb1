There are a couple of attack vectors to consider:

* The recipient's machine is compromised
* The sender's machine is compromised

BIP-70 and other ways of having the sender verify the destination on a
second device will help protect against sender compromise.  For a
person-to-person situation, you could verify the address by voice.

For the case where the recipient is compromised, you would want to
verify the address with the recipient's multisig security service.
Extending BIP-70 to allow multiple signatures would be one way to go
about this.  You would at least want to have a web page controlled by
the security service where you can verify addresses.
