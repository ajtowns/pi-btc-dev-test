Hi Andreas / Jeff,

Access to the UTXO set can be done using libcoin (see the coinexplorer example), which also has a rest interface. Access to the UTXO set pr address/script requires indexing of all scripts, which was easy in libcoin as the blockchain is stored in a sqlite database. Integrating this in bitcoind would require setting up and maintaining such an index ad hoc.

Michael
