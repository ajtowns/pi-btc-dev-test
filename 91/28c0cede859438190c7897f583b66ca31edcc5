Dear Luke,

thanks for your prompt response.

That's a useful reminder.

Even when you don't reuse your address, by considering the amounts in
a transaction, it is often easy to identify what is the main amount
and what is the residual. e.g. "oh, he spent $1.99 worth of bitcoin
out of his big bitcoin address, so the $1.99 is being paid, and the
rest is still the same person", and so trace identities. By using
power-of-two buckets (based on the binary expansion of the amount), it
becomes harder to do amount analysis. Sometimes, buckets are joined or
split, but that still doesn't help much identify how several buckets
combine into one transaction. As for transaction fees ? indeed, they
should probably be paid in separate small-bucket transactions. I don't
see any particular difficulty about it.

There is nothing urgent indeed. Nevertheless, I fear that the current
usage pattern is too easily traceable, and that tweaks such as the one
I'm proposing could make amount-based tracing much harder.

Thanks for your hard work!
