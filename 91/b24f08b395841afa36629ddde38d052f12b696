I definitely think this is a case that should be addressed better than
at present.

To consider a concrete use case, imagine I wish to be able to give my
friends and acquaintances a paper business card with a QR code on it,
that they can use to make payments to me.  I don't own a domain or any
kind of X.509 certificate and I don't run an HTTP server.  I don't
feel comfortable with a solution that requires me to trust a third
party to complete the payments.

At the moment, I can give them a business card with a Bitcoin address.
Being able to give out a business card with a stealth address would be
a major advance.
