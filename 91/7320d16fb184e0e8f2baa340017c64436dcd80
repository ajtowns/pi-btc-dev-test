Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP151 protocol incompatibility
Message-ID: <ba422d5e-8e96-3475-2a29-80d89fd67322@voskuil.org>

The BIP151 proposal states:

> This proposal is backward compatible. Non-supporting peers will ignore
the encinit messages.

This statement is incorrect. Sending content that existing nodes do not
expect is clearly an incompatibility. An implementation that ignores
invalid content leaves itself wide open to DOS attacks. The version
handshake must be complete before the protocol level can be determined.
While it may be desirable for this change to precede the version
handshake it cannot be described as backward compatible.
