May I remind you that by far, most of that investment is not in the Bitcoin Core software.

It is made to things building on top of the network/protocol, under the assumption that nothing really stupid will happen and the network will not go down etc.

This implies a level of trust in the node software to maintain consensus, but doesn't necessarily mean that all rough corners have been dealt with regarding implementation.

(but this is exactly the kind of argument I'm trying to avoid getting pulled into)
