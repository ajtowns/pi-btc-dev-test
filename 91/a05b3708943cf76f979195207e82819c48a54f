It looks as if you entirely missed my point. I'm The Decider for *code issues* regarding Bitcoin Core. Consensus issues should not be considered part of that, they span multiple implementations.

So I'm *not* the decider for anything that concerns the behavior of the global consensus, and I cannot be, as I have explained in the previous post, and as Sipa explained in his.

Speaking of process, let me remind you that there is a BIP processs: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki 

If you think it's not clear enough, which may explain why you did not even attempt to follow it for your block size increase, feel free to make improvements.
