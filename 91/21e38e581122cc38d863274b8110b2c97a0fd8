Which is better IMO. I can't imagine anyone writing down a long Base58
encoded string.

Not true, BIP39 supports 12/18/24 words (= 128/192/256 bits of entropy).

This is nice addition, indeed. But we needed to limit the data as
possible in order not to increase the number of words needed to be noted
down.

It has a detection. Not correction though.

True, but having one or two solid options are better than having
gazillions of possible options.

> - BIP 39 wallet implementors can use their own word lists, breaking cross wallet compatibility.

True, but they are encouraged to use the list provided. Possibility to
outsource KDF outside of your "standard" breaks much more compatibility
than this.
