I joined the list when Bitcoin was already in the 10-billions of market 
capitalization, and it actually really surprised me how low the traffic is here 
given the importance of Bitcoin.

So as a random stranger to the project, I would vote against that if I was 
allowed to. There really should be *more* discussion here, and splitting the 
list up won't help with that.
