Thanks Wladimir!

My long term vision for bitcoin-core was always a more user friendly
UI without loosing the security and privacy features bitcoin-core offers
.
However, it has shown that this is relatively hard to achieve. Its
unclear to me, what role wallets (and related UIs) will play in the
future of bitcoin. I think it needs several years until something like
bitcoin can be used to "pay for every coffee in the world" [1].
But I'm happy to explore this path!

That was and is also the reason why I'm often focus on non-UI-related
changes that keep bitcoin healthy and form a more defined role for the U
I.

Short words to myself:
I'm a senior software developer, 35 years old, living in Switzerland
(UTC+1).

Thanks for the trust and I try to give my best to maintain and improve
the GUI.
