Communication between the merchant and buyer would be needed in this case.

I'd say that would be not unreasonable if something is to be refunded after
a year or more. After all, people may have moved, bank accounts changed,
even outside the bitcoin world.

It should probably not be accepted to set a very low expiration time for
the refund address, like <3 months, as it's as bad as not providing a
refund address at all and brings back all the pre-BIP70 confusion.
