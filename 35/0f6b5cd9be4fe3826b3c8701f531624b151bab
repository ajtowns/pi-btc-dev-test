I don't think there's an official definition of "SPV proof." I wasn't
trying to make a argument "from definition" (that would be fallacious!).
Rather I suspected that we had different concepts in mind and wanted to
check.

That said, I do think that the definition I gave matches how the term is
used in the Satoshi whitepaper, and the way in which SPV clients like
BitcoinJ work. "Best chain" is typically taken to mean the most-work,
*valid* chain. Without invoking moon math or assumptions of honest peers
and jamming-free networks, the only way to know a chain is valid is to
witness the each and every block. SPV nodes on the other hand, simply
trust that the most-work chain is a valid chain, based on economic
arguments about the opportunity cost of mining invalid blocks. These SPV
nodes use block headers as proofs to determine the most-work block
connected to the genesis block or most recent checkpoint. So yes,
operationally at least this is what the community seems to mean by "SPV
proof".

Now regarding your use case:

This linear scan of block headers is what I would prefer to avoid. By
using back-links you make it have log(N) space usage.
