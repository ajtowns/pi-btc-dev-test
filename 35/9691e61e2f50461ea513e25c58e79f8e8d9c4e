For some reason my mail client is being thick and not responding
on-list, sorry about that...

If you are using a self-signed cert to do any kind of important data
transfer you are just being stupid.  Here I am assuming your computer
isnt actually compromised, but only the network is, which I think is a
fairly good assumption.

No, DNSSEC is very well done, this thread is specifically about the
security implications of using DNSSEC for Bitcoin address communication.
IMO it is not a good idea, as for it to be secure against a coffee-shop
network MITMer you have to implement a full resolver with root trust
anchors and knowledge of root servers in Bitcoin, which does not seem
like a good idea.

I totally agree, however I don't think DNS-based resolving is a good
idea here.  HTTPS does have several advantages over a DNSSEC-based
solution without any significant drawbacks that I can see.
