This means the organization needs the consent of six individuals in order to sign a transaction: the president, the CFO, and any four of the board members. A 6-of-9 multisig would not accomplish the same policy, as then any six board members could successfully sign a transaction without the consent of the president or CFO. Of course the multi-signature scheme could be expanded to allow for hierarchical threshold topologies, or Shamir's Secret Sharing can be used to distribute keys at the second level (and further, if desired).

Depends on your definition of "can." Bitcoin's scripting language is awesome, but it's mostly useless due to the requirement that scripts match one of a select few "standard" templates in order to be allowed to propagate across the network and be mined into blocks. I really hate IsStandard and wish it would die.
