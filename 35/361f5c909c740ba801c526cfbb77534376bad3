As for how you can do that, on stock gnupg:

    gpg --send-key 934023AE18144354

Or possibly:

    gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --send-key 934023AE18144354

If your gpg.conf doesn't have a keyserver set.

Note that if you add a new subkey (as well as other changes to your key)
you need to resend your key to the keyservers or people won't be able to
verify your signatures.


Disclaimer: OpenPGP kinda sucks. Deal with it.
