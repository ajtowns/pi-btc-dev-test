Paul,

I'm right here, are you having a conversation with me or are you on a stage talking to an audience?

> FYI that document is nearly two years old, and although it is still overwhelmingly accurate, new optimizations allow us (I think) to push the waiting period to several weeks and the total ACK counting period up to several months.

What does that have to do with my question? The counting period, if I understood correctly, is something miners do, not full nodes.

Also, if the document is old and/or outdated, do you happen to have a link to a more update-to-date version of the spec? It would be helpful for review.

Right, for [DC#0] and [DC#1], but for [DC#2] an [DC#3] you marked it as "Yes" without substantiating why you did so.

And that is not how P2SH works.

How is that an answer to my question?

What does "[DC#2] and [DC#3] would certainly have an interest in understanding what is going on" mean?

In P2SH, all upgraded nodes will reject invalid P2SH transactions, period.

What exactly would [DC#2] and [DC#3] nodes do when faced with an invalid WT^ transaction ? invalid in the sense that it contains funds which miners are stealing?

Again, in P2SH miners cannot steal funds, because all full nodes have a fully automatic enforcement policy.

Kind regards,
Greg Slepak
