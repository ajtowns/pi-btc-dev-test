Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Warning message when running wallet in
	Windows XP (or drop support?)
Message-ID: <CA+s+GJDdENtqQt1f+L5htuuyPxUxsq0prLQFBLirTjJz0nG1gw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Today I noticed that even my bank is warning people to not do internet
banking with Windows XP.

If it is no longer secure enough for online banking it's CERTAINLY not
secure enough to run a wallet (for a node only it would be ok-ish as they
have no keys to protect).
Any opinions on what to do here? Just warn and allow the user to continue?
Redirect them to a 'Windows XP is dangerous' message on bitcoin.org?
(Microsoft uses http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-support-help)

The drawback of dropping XP support completely would be that a lot of
computers (especially in China and Russia etc) are still running XP, so
this could cause the network to lose nodes.

If you're maintainer of other wallet software: how are you handling this?
Are you going to drop XP support completely? If so, starting from when?

Regards,
Wladimir
