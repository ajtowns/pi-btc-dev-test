For ordinary transactions which are not performing interesting smart
contracts that particular is better addressed via canonical encoding,
which is immediately available and doesn't have the associated costs
(new pubkey type adoption, 20%-30% UTXO size increase, need for nodes
to fixup txid references, etc.).

Please, as I said up-thread: this is good and importantstuff to work
on, but it shouldn't be oversold.
