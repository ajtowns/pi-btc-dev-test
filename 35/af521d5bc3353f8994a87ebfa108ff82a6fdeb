Documentation and code can have different licenses, the sole existence of 
various documentation licenses attests to that point.
Shipping your docs under a separate licence has never been a problem before, 
so you don't have to worry that you can't ship documentation with code.

That said, I wrote my suggestion in reply to Luke's BIP2 revival which is a 
more formal suggestion of a solution. Maybe you can ACK that one instead?

Last, in preparation of acceptance of BIP2 I changed the licence of my BIP to 
be dual-licensed.  Now its also available under a Creative Commons license.

Have a nice day!
