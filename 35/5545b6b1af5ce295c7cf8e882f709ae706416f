Those clarifications are what I needed to hear. For some reason I started
thinking about this last night and wanted to bring it up just in case it
would help, but def. not necessary. Will get back to more low hanging fruit
in the UI/UX as I get to know the project more.

Gregory: "But there doesn't have to be and shouldn't just be one
network transport
for Bitcoin."
is there a formal abstraction for a Transport layer? I suppose if there
isn't it'll be there when needed.

Thanks!
