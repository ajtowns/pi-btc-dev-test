It's a problem with the mailing list software, not your setup. BitPay could
disable the phishing protections but that seems like a poor solution. The
only real fix is to send from a non @bitpay.com email address. Gmail or
Hotmail will work, I think. Yahoo won't: they enforce the same strict
policies than bitpay does.
