In many iterations of editing the wordlist we made our best to pick
words which are easy to remember, still "neutral". Unfortunately it's
almost impossible to exclude some words which may together create
negative co-notations.

Thankfully we removed all racist and religious words so I believe all
three authors mentioned in the BIP are safe against fundamentalist
bitcoin users :-).
