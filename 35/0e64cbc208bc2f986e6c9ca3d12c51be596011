Hi Bazyli,

I actually do my main development on Mac OSX, so it surprises me to hear - I build Xcode projects with libcoin daily on Mac OSX and linux, on Windows it is agreeable more of a fight to build. QT is really not needed, I kept it there for BitcoinQT, that was once part of the tree too, will remove it as the qt part got split out.

Building clean on Mac requires OpenSSL, BDB and Boost - all can be installed using homebrew, also remember to use the latest cmake, and a normal cmake xcode call: cmake -GXcode should do the job. Otherwise pls send me the debug output. 

A few quick notes for building stuff there:
 - try with coinexplorer, it is the base code I am using - it splits out the wallet from the server, nice if you e.g. want to build a webcoin like server.
 - The wallet parts from bitcoind I don't use personally, so if you have problems with these I need to have a closer look.

Also note that as the first version of libcoin was a direct refactorization of bitcoin, the current one add a lot of different features and handles things quite differently - you can e.g. lookup any unspent output by script (bitcoin address) in milliseconds (nice for web wallets).

Finally: 

> 	Because of the templates that bitcoind is actually using that's not gonna work ever. That's why BitcoinKit is a separate dynamic library that's compiled with gcc (or at least llvm pretending to be gcc ;P)

As I mentioned it also compiles on Linux (gcc) - gcc is quite savvy when it comes to templates - I agree that the template stuff from Database.h is quite involved, but as I mentioned before try with coinexplorer.

- I will try to do a from scratch recompilation to see if I experience similar issues...

Also - if you are good at creating frameworks on Mac OSX using cmake, help would be appreciated! I think that libcoin by defaults build using shared libs, this configurable from ccmake using the dynamic library option.

Thanks,

Michael
