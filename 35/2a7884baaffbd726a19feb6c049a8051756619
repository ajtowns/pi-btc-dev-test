Let's assume bitcoin has scaled up to 2000 tx/s. We all want this, 
right? https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability. Block size is 500 MB. 
CPU, network and archival blockchain storage seem to solvable.

Let's say SatoshiDice-like systems are doing informational transactions 
that produce unspendable outputs, because they can and users are paying 
for it anyway (proved in real life). 400 unspendable outputs per second 
would be realistic.

This would be bloating UTXO data at a speed of 52 GB/year. That's a very 
big memory leak. And this is just the unspendable outputs.

Bitcoin cannot scale up until such dust output spamming is discouraged 
at the protocol level.
