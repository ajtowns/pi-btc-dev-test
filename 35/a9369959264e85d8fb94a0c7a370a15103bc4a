Hi Ron,

FYI your mail is being spamfoldered due to Yahoo's DMARC policy and the
brokenness of the SF.net mailing list software. I would not expect to get
replies reliably whilst this is the case. I think we should move away from
SF.net for hosting mailing lists personally, because it's this list that's
at fault not Yahoo, but until then you may wish to send to the list with a
different email address.

As to your question,

assert() should have *no* side effects, that is the problem.

Back in 2010 most code was still being written by Satoshi so perhaps you
should ask him. Regardless, it's very common for professional codebases to
require assertions be enabled. For example the entire Google C++ codebase
uses always-on assertions that have side effects liberally: it's convenient
and safe, when you have the guarantee the code will always run, and the
performance benefits of compiling out assertions are usually non-existent.

So for this reason I think Bitcoin Core currently will fail to build if
assertions are disabled, and that seems OK to me.
