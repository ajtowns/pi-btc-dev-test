Well, I guess "hurting" the network is perhaps a bit dramatic. There are
already lots of ways the download process can go wrong and take days. Using
the torrent is much faster. But my understanding is that this will slow
down the bootstrap process for some people yes. Remote peers won't try and
download in parallel or anything like that.
