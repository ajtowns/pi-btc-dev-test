I apologize, you are correct, I should not have used the word "real". 

However, if you look at section 3 of the RFC, the first hierarchal level (which in http is used to describe hosts) can be any "authority", not necessarily a hostname.

So, you could use tx, block, address, etc. as the authority for their paths.

The bitcoin: thing leads to additional code to mutate it into a proper URI before passing it to URL parsing. And I think it would be fine to include the type looking up. For example:
