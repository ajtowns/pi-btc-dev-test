Even if it's new and has not received any feedback, I think my solution to
op_maturity is quite clean.
But anyway, yes, the non-relative cltv is much simpler in design and
doesn't have to wait for the other. On the other hand, I would upgrade it
to absolute cltv like you suggested and take the current height as a
parameter to verifyScript instead of using the nLockTime as reference.
If we know we're going to use it for rcltv/op_maturity, better put add soon
rather than later, specially if that will give us a more powerful cltv.
If we don't want that height param, we can leave it out of for op_maturity
too, but that's the wingle decision about rcltv/maturity that affects cltv
so better solve that first.
