Getting OT...

For a while I've wanted to combine one of these mnemonic code generators
with an NLP engine to do something like output a short story as the
passphrase, even a humorous onem with the key encoded in the story
itself (remember the gist of the story and that's sufficient to
reconstruct the key).

Also, obligatory link about the failures of unsanitized word lists:

It can really backfire to get one of these things wrong.
