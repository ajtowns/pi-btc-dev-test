I'm sorry for the distraction with the mailing list problems.

Taking an ecosystem view, the miners are important, so are all the other
participants who rely on it and  invest time, effort and energy to make
Bitcoin work and work well.

I am in contact with Primavera and it would appear that the Cyberport is
available for use on October 14 and 15 (Wed/Thursday).

Last November, this was where the Global Bitcoin Summit (Hong Kong)
<http://www.cyberport.hk/en/about_cyberport/our_5_centres/collaboration_centre/collaboration_news/2146>
was hosted with the participation of many of China's leading
Bitcoin-related companies. There is a meeting now in Shanghai.

It would be an honour to host a more technical meeting to discuss BIP100,
101 et al. should be interest to do so.
