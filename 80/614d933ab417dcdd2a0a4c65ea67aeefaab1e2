Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Merge avoidance and P2P connection encryption
Message-ID: <CANEZrP1gDxcKO8z4hgM9BJU6-+Ft0oaiCZjqjN4MxGEJCgs5Ng@mail.gmail.com>

I wrote an article intended for a broad/non-developer audience on a few
Bitcoin privacy topics:

- P2P connection encryption
- Address re-use/payment protocol
- CoinJoin and merge avoidance

I don't think there's anything much new here for people who were involved
with the BIP70 design discussions, but it may prove a useful resource when
talking about privacy features in the payment protocol. Specifically the
ability to request multiple outputs and submit multiple transactions that
satisfy them. The article elaborates on how to use that feature to achieve
some useful privacy outcomes.

I also analyze what using SSL for P2P connections would buy us and what it
wouldn't.
