The discussion was about what each state means, not the thresholds
exactly.  I agree that can be set later.

I agree that miners should apply the rule from the start in their own
blocks.


*defined*
Miners set bit
Miners apply rule to their own blocks
If 75% of blocks of last 2016 have bit set, goto tentative


*tentative*
Miners set bit
Miners apply rule to their own blocks
Miners enforce rule in blocks with bit set (reject invalid blocks)
If 95% of blocks of last 2016 have bit set, goto locked-in


*locked-in*

Point of no return
Miners set bit
Miners apply rule to their own blocks
Miners enforce rule in blocks with bit set (reject invalid blocks)
After 2016 blocks goto activated


*activated*

Miners don't set bit
Reject any block that has the bit set for 10080 blocks (10 diff periods)
Reject blocks that don't follow new rule

The advantage of enforcing the rule when 75% is reached (but only for
blocks with the bit set) is that miners get early notification that they
have implemented the rule incorrectly.    They might produce blocks that
they think are fine, but which aren't.
