I think I can solve the debate and give everyone what they want.

Some people want BIP65, others do not.

We can roll out 65 in a clever way, such that Greg/PeterT can get it, but
Mike and Peter R don't need to have it (both versions can run alongside
each other). Even better, people can switch back and forth between versions
as much as they like.

How might this work? Well, paradoxically, we could do this by *imposing
additional constraints* on transaction validation, such that transactions
made a very specific certain way will always look valid to non-CLTVers, but
for CLTVers they will not be valid unless the CLTV rules are followed. The
obvious concern is that non-CLTV people might receive invalid payments.
However, their software is already set up to request payments in a non-CLTV
way, so, luckily, this is actually not a problem at all! SPV clients can
elect to only connect to nodes which are non-CLTV.

Problem solved!

I am happy to have solved this problem for you all, and ended this discord
harmoniously. If we all put our heads together, these words of founding
father Aretha Franklin will ring true: "there's nothing we can't overcome".
