I think this would solve one of the other issues I raised about the green
address idea .... you can have some kind of trust aggregator sign the
transactions. Merchants like MtGox that send would create a transaction,
export it, upload it to the trusted authority which can just check IP
address or something to verify it's really coming from MtGox, then sign it
and broadcast it.
