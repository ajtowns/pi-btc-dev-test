Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal to allow users to configure the maximum
 block weight based on a support threshold

Instead of block thresholds, use utxo bits to coordinate size changes
(larger and smaller should be allowed).

There is no reason for miners to be involved in a decision to change this
aspects of the protocol.   Plenty of other ways to coordinate.

Otherwise someone can make it seem to a miner like 99pct of nodes are ready
for a larger weight.... even though that's false.
