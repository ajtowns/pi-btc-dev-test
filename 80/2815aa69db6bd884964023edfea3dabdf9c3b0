Removal of isStandard() would be even better/more flexible.

A whitelist of low risk opcodes seems like a reasonable compromise.

My thoughts behind these two BIPs are that they are a smaller change that
adds functionality required for a particular use-case (and some others).

Changing the entire philosophy behind isStandard() is a much bigger change
than just adding one new type.
