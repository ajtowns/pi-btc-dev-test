Come on, this is only sent over the line at connection time at most
once. No need to overdesign a scheme here.

Anyhow, if we like to bike-shed so much:
- UUIDs are 16 bytes -- most human-recognizable strings are shorter.
And they're ugly to use as well.
- OIDs need central and hierarchical coordination, just what we're
trying to avoid.
