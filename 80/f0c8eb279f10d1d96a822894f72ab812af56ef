When you say "running exclusively on Tor", what do you mean exactly?
Do you also connect or allow connections through hidden services?

I made outbound connections through Tor exit points the only way to
connect to Bitcoin, and increased the number of allowed outbound
connection in order to get more meaningful values.

Lately, I could see unusual behaviour at:

* 2014-11-28 13:14 UTC
* 2014-11-25 07:32 UTC
* 2014-11-24 13:06 UTC

Anything I should look into?

I think this issue is more important than it seems.

Firstly, when running Tor-only, there are still attack vectors which
make use of the DoS protection deficiencies.

Secondly, if we tell people not to connect directly if they want
privacy, how do we ensure that these indirect methods will not come
with implications for their privacy?

Best regards,

Isidor
