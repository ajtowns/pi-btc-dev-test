Subject: [bitcoin-dev] [patch] Switching Bitcoin Core to sqlite db
Message-ID: <CADm_WcaLQzigsdmFR43JqiCYJVpmqkhVDc8GiVG=UN+Z1zg7+w@mail.gmail.com>

Here is the beginnings of an implementation to replace leveldb with sqlite:
https://github.com/jgarzik/bitcoin/tree/2015_sqlite

It builds, but still needs work before passing tests.

It was noted that leveldb is unmaintained, and this is part of researching
alternatives that are maintained and reliable.
