Hello,

newbie here, thanks for patience.

I start 0.5.0 without wallet.dat. It creates 100 new keys. I then 
encrypt them. It should be now bug free and totally secure, so I back 
the wallet up. I then click "new address", it doesn't use the old 2-100 
addresses, instead generates a new batch, because it assumes the old 
ones are leaked, but in fact they are not. I receive funds to my new 2nd 
address (which is now not backed up). I lose the new wallet. Restore 
from backup. Bitcoins lost forever?

Sorry if false alarm, thanks.
