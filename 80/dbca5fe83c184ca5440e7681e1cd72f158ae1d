Sounds plausible, except SPV protocols would need to include this coinbase
txn if it's going to help SPV clients. (Until a softfork is activated, SPV
clients should not rely on this encoding, since until that time the results
can be fabricated by individual miners.)

Hm, when you mention Sybil attack, I don't quite follow.

When a client relies on any report of a mempool [*], this is already
outside the realm of locally-verifiable SPV information, so they are
already susceptible to the service making false claims. If that's
acceptable (and in many cases it may be) then this whole mechanism is moot,
because the client can ask the service for fee statistics for past blocks.

This is interesting for me, because I had previously believed fees were
fairly static presently, and also because I like hearing about real life
wallet implementations.

So if this "SPV Fee Stats" feature were added, a wallet might rely on an
API for timely stats (aka "block height < 1") then verify that the API
isn't lying after doing SPV verification of fee stats for confirmed blocks.

That makes sense, although there's no SPV equivalent for exchange data.
