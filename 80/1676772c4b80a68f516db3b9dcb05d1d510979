The use case is that you could burn the node implementation + block data +
a live operating system on a read-only medium. This could be set in stone
for a long time.

There would be no consensus code to keep up to date with protocol
developments, because it doesn't take active part in it.

I don't think it would be terribly useful right now, but it could be useful
when nodes that host all history become rare. It'd allow distributing
'pieces of history' in a self-contained form.

Yes, it would be nice to at least be able to express it, if it doesn't make
the protocol too finicky.

That makes sense.

In general, if you want a block 50 from the tip, it would be best to
request it from a node that only serves the last N (N>~50) blocks, and not
a history node that could use the same bandwidth to serve earlier, rarer
blocks to others.
