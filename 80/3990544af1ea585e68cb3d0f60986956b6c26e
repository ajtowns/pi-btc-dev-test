That is a great presentation, thanks for sharing that!

Though I question the validity of the claim that ECC is so much more
secure than RSA (with appropriate keysizes).  My experience from
studying quantum computing is that Factoring and DLP are intimately
related, such that a break of one is likely to break the other.  In
fact, I seem to remember that QCs use an efficient DLP-solving circuit
to "shortcut" the factoring problem.  But it's been a long time since I
looked at it, so I don't remember for sure.   Also, it's not clear
whether that relationship exists outside the scope of QCs.

It's still a good presentation, but they're pushing ECC pretty hard as
the answer to the cryptopocalypse, and I'm not convinced that's a real
answer.
