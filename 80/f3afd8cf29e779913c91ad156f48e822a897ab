Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Block size possible solution - to set minimum size
Message-ID: <CALNn0ZZ5gY6R7gzpLpbNnFecAz35ZqaLx_RNPxx=SoJTAdHDXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
As I understand the main problem of the fork Core<->XT is possibility
of double spending:
-I run XT and spend my coins
-it is written in 8mb block
-Core does not accept this block
-I run Core and spend my coins again
-it is written in 1mb block
-but XT accepts this block too
so
-in the XT blockchain both blocks [8] and [1] contain my coins

I thought that possible solution can be to set minimum block size
i.e.
2016: 1mb <= blockSize < 2mb
2017: 2mb <= blockSize < 3mb
2018: 3mb <= blockSize < 4mb
etc

Free space could be filled with zeroes and compressed.

That's all, just an idea.
