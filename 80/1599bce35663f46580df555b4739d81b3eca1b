I think it would be ideal if someone wanted to take up wxBitcoin. Maybe after 
backporting to wx 2.8...

That being said, I have no interest, as I hate wx, and prefer Qt in general ;)

Please be careful to avoid the centralization mindset. There is no "main 
project"; there is bitcoind, wxBitcoin, Bitcoin-Qt, MultiBit, and many other 
non-functional clients, which should be given equal footing (before 
considering their differences). There shouldn't be given any special treatment 
to bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt just because "Gavin et al" happen to maintain it.

KDE literally just closed a bug of mine that I reported in 2002, because the 
component with the bug hasn't been part of KDE since 2008.
