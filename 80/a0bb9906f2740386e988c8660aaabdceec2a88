Actually,  I'm not sure if your solution works,  because it relies on
broadcasting a tx to the network that isn't valid.   I believe that the
first tx in your proposal will be rejected and thus you'll need to exchange
the tx's offline.

However,  third-parties could pretty easily and conveniently host a service
for this kind of exchange.
