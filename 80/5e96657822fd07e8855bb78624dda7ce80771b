Hi everyone,

I have some agreements and disagreements.

I agree with Zmn:

1. That the sidechain's header is fully defined by the bits of data
included in mainchain headers. These bits include "h*" (some hash that
is either of the header itself or side:hashMerkleRoot), something that
forces these hashes into a DAG-like structure (in Zmn's case, it is a
full hashPrevBlock, whereas for us it is just a tiny integer).
2. That "miner-voting" (for lack of better phrase) accomplishes the same
task as any SPV Proof of any kind.
3. That sidechains basically need to be merged-mined; to do otherwise,
there are marginal costs but really no marginal benefits.

However:

1. I think it is a mistake for SHOM ("Sidechain Headers on Mainchain")
to "unify merged-mining and the WT^ validity voting". This causes the
SHOM to regress to mere extension blocks, and they therefore take on
many of the negative properties of extension blocks.

I don't think that this is true. 51% miner-group can pay bribes to
themselves, and orphan any block or txn that disagrees with them.

I also don't think that there is any meaningful difference between "what
the economic majority wants" and "what the miners do". To me it is a
blindingly obvious fact: miners are paid more, only if they increase the
value of { exchange_rate * ([x>=0] + txn_fees) }. This only increases if
Bitcoin is expected to be more objectively useful, and if its users
treasure its use sufficiently to warrant the payment of high tx fees.

When miners disagree with, for example, the bitcoin-dev mailing list,
this is because miners are attempting to guess what the economic
majority wants, and, in making this earnest attempt, miners believe that
the bitcoin-dev interest is different from the economic majority interest.

Obviously, I don't expect to change any minds on this list. After all,
(since no one dares oppose the economic majority), it is a smart
strategy to pretend that the economic majority always agrees with you.
And it is extra smart to avoid examining that belief too carefully.

I agree with most of this, but I think in proof of work and proof of
stake the security guarantee is more reasonable.. In SHOM, there is no
reason to believe that the the quantity "total amount of money available
for withdrawal in a given time" will always be smaller than "sum of 288
bribes".

As long as some critical mass of investors exist, there is no difference
between short and long term profits. It is impossible for an investor to
act in a way that affects the long term, but does not immediately also
affect the short term.

Some documentation is here:

I don't think this makes any sense, because it implies that the value of
288 block's worth of mainchain BTC transaction fees should always be
worth more than the entire market capitalization of Bitcoin.

Specifically, in this case, the error it introduces is that someone
could get around the fixed value by just using multiple sidechains. Then
the miners would just attack all the sidechains simultaneously. (And
these smaller sidechains would themselves have much smaller fees.)

Sergio likes this idea, but I think that this attitude represents a lack
of faith in the design. Either the design works or it does not. Either
the federation works or it does not.

This is already the case in what we have done...the only way to
guarantee that all clients report the same WT^ is if they are all
running softforks of the first version.

This is why I do not want ultra-easy, completely-permissionless creation
of sidechains. Miners (and therefore, users) may NOT desire the EXPECTED
behavior of the sidechain.

Yes, see above.
