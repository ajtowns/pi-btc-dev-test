FYI:

This is an issue I filed related to adding secp256k1 into Web Crypto API
which will be implemented natively in (some) web browsers.

If there is any feedback from crypto implementers, please feel free to add
comments to this thread:

--- Comment #2 from Myron Davis <myrond at gmail.com> ---
Could this be looked at again?

Last response was waiting for feedback from crypto implementors.

Currently secp256k1 is supported in the following SSL/TLS libraries now
Botan
NSS
openssl
LibreSSL
PolarSSL
JSSE

The three other curves are all all have parameters which do not define how
they
were generated.  secp256k1 curve has some great advantages in faster
signature
verification and how the values were determined for the curve.  (i.e. not
random).

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4492

The curve has had a lot of eyes on it with lots of hardware and software
supporting this curve.

With discovery of backdoor's in NIST's random number generator
(https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the_strange_sto.html ) I
would
like to see a determined parameter curve instead of a "random" curve option.

Thanks
