Can you update it so that it only applies to transactions with version
number 3 and higher.  Changing the meaning of a field is exactly what the
version numbers are for.

You could even decode version 3 transactions like that.

Version 3 transactions have a sequence number of 0xFFFFFFFF and the
sequence number field is re-purposed for relative lock time.

This means that legacy transactions that have already been signed but have
a locktime in the future will still be able to enter the blockchain
(without having to wait significantly longer than expected).
