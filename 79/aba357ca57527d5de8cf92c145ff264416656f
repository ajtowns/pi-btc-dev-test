I just said it exists. I don't expect anyone to promote or merge it.

I suspect because they haven't figured out how. Take it or leave it.

This is a step in that direction, at least, by providing the mode as input.
Since 0.4 is moving to Qt, perhaps moving GetMinFee to QtScript is 
appropriate.

Again, take it or leave it, but in the meantime you're asking for trouble from 
users who feel they're being forced to pay more than they have to. Or perhaps 
rather than trouble, that decision will increase awareness of other clients 
that don't try to control the users. That could be good too.
