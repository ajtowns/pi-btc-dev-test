No, I think one of the fundamental problems with the Foundation is it tries
to represent everybody's interests. The interests of exchanges are not
necessarily the same as end-users or miners, for example.

But it would make sense for exchanges (for example) to get together and
come to consensus on whatever issues are important to them, like the recent
consensus and then statement from "the Chinese miners" regarding the block
size issue.
