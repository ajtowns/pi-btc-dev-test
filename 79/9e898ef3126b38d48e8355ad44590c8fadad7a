No, I'm afraid it has significant flaws. The two chief flaws are (1)
there is absolutely no reason to include asset tagging information if it
is not validated - that just bloats the block chain, and (2) you
shouldn't be using fixed increments for share sizes either. It's not
future-proof as the minimum output size changes based on the minimum fee
(currently 540 satoshis, not 5,400, and it will float in the near
future). And needing a capital of 54 btc for a million shares is totally
unacceptable.

Flavien, I know that I've seen you on the Bitcoin-X mailing list, where
these issues have been mostly worked out:

Have you seen the padded order-based coloring scheme worked out here?
