It was implemented in the waylaying client with the merge of Bitcoin-Qt for drag and drop, and just recently for system URI handling in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/70f55355e29c8e45b607e782c5d76609d23cc858. However the version on the wiki armed as BIP 20 has a ton of extraneous crap in it's number encoding which is not implemented in Bitcoin-Qt since it was explicitly voted against at the time the spec was being discussed. If that stuff were removed, I would agree that it is final.

It's been Final (even according to BIP 1 standards) since late January 2011. 
The only change recently is assigning it a BIP number for formality.

Once P2SH is deployed, it will probably make good sense to revisit the URI 
Scheme for revision, and eventually move BIP 20 to Replaced/Superceded status.
