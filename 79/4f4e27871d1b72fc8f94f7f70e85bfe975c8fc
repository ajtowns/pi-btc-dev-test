Would that really be the case though? If it takes 5% to find a block, but it contains 5% more transactions would that not mean it?s the same? That would argue against the change if not for the fact that the blocks will be bigger for the next difficulty period.

I guess that could make the difficulty fluctuate a bit depending on the amount of transactions and the fees being paid. Would it really matter in the long run though? Since it?s the same amount of miners, doesn?t that just mean it?s just the number that is lower, not the actual investment needed to mine the blocks? Not sure if this would open up some forms of attacks on the system for someone willing to lose money though?


Very good feedback though, thanks a lot :)
