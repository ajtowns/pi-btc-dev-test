I agree that these are critical and I'd love to help, especially on #2 and
#3.  #3 will, by necessity, include a thorough review of the code, which
may uncover latent issues.

I think that for #2 it would also be good to publish a "Best security
practices" document to try and educate the user base.

That is understandable.  However, something to think about later is that
multi-signature coins can help with #2, even with compromised end-user
machines.
