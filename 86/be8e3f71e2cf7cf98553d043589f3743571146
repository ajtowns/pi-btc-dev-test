In fact I considered only requiring an increase in fee rate, based on the
theory that if absolute fee went down, the transaction must be smaller and thus
miners could overall earn more from the additional transactions they could fit
into their block. But to do that properly requires considering whether or not
that's actually true in the particular state the mempool as a whole happens to
be in, so I ditched that idea early on for the much simpler criteria of both a
feerate and absolute fee increase.
