Go away.

Mike specifically mentioned the idea of using Tor addresses, which are
authenticated. In addition this mechanism to create a backbone
*automatically* is exactly as decentralized as Bitcoin mining itself is.
It has nothing to do with Google.

I suggested the mechanism myself for slightly different reasons, and if
you know me, you'd know I'm the first to jump on anyone pushing
centralization.
