No, I said there was no chance it'd be accepted "due to a number of
BIP-level issues in addition to debate about the patch itself. For
instance, Gavin has never given any details about testing; at minimum
we'd need a BIP16 style quality assurance document. We also frown on
writing software with building expiration dates, let alone expiration
dates that trigger non-deterministically. (Note how my recently merged
CLTV considered the year 2038 problem to avoid needing a hard fork at
that date)"

Of course no further review was done - issues were identified and they
didn't get fixed. Why would we do further review on something that was
broken whose author wasn't interested in fixing even non-controversial
and obvious problems?

The process is to do review, fix issues identified, and repeat until all
issues are fixed.
