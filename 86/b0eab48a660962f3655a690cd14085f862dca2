As Peter said, "much" should be quantified.

Remember that there is a statistical distribution here, what is the probability
of how many seconds per headers?

Sounds like you are changing economics and requiring miners to have even better
network connections. This is not a thing to do lightly and it probably a bad
idea.

I understand Pieter Wuille is working on letting Bitcoin propagate and make use
of pure block headers, a step towards SPV and partial UTXO mode.

Orphan measurement would be very useful for a lot of reasons, how about you
think about that first? It wouldn't have the potential data rate issues either
and should be a very simple change. Just set some threshold relative to the
height of the best block where you will not further propagate and orphan
block(header) and prior to that limit do so freely. I believe the change would
be 100% compatible with the P2P protocol as it is based on inventories.
