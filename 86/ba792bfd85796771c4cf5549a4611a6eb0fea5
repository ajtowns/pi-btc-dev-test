Yes, that was my point.

Or maybe because they place control of the "true chain" in the hands of
those selecting the checkpoints? It's not a great leap for the parties
distributing the checkpoints to become the central authority.

I recommend users of our node validate the full chain without
checkpoints and from that chain select their own checkpoints and place
them into config. From that point forward they can apply the
optimization. Checkpoints should never be hardcoded into the source.

I find "buried softfork" a curious name as you are using it. You seem to
be implying that this type of change is itself a softfork as opposed to
a hardfork that changes the activation of a softfork. It was my
understanding that the term referred to the 3 softforks that were being
"buried", or the proposal, but not the burial itself.

Nevertheless, this proposal shouldn't have "that problem" because it is
clearly neither a security feature nor an optimization. That is the
first issue that needs to be addressed.
