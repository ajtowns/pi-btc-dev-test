It isn't securable. It is running on the honor system exclusively. It will
be attacked, it will fail, losses will be had, the attackers will walk away
with embarrassingly large sums.

trusted (as you suggest with your "accountable parties").

But the check means nothing at all to you since no information which you
can learn from doing so can be trusted for use in decision making of any
kind, so why do it? Unless you pay for hosting of that particular node
which you test, you have no reason to care for any reason other than simple
statistics.

The claims I made is based on simple economic analysis - if *to be able to
attack* first requires effort and risk that exceed the payoff, you're
unlikely to try. Being legally accountable and identified in advance and
having to build reputation before being trusted with attack-worthy sums is
strongly discouraging.
