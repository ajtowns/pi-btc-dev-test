Not much has changed besides internal workings, right?
Though perhaps that's still significant enough for 0.8.

Amir seems to be more and more absent these days, so it might be nice to setup 
a successor failsafe in the event that he cannot be reached. It would be a 
shame for the BIP process to fall apart merely because we can't get numbers 
assigned.

But more important to the success of BIP today, I think, is encouraging wider 
community participation. The stratum mining mess seems to be a direct result 
of lack of participation in the GBT BIP process (resulting in it not being as 
ideal as some pools desire) and lack of any peer review/contribution toward 
the stratum protocol. What can we do to increase awareness of BIP and 
encourage more collaboration?
