The problem of UTXO in principal scales with the block size limit. Thus it should be fixed BEFORE you consider increasing the block size limit. Otherwise you just kick the can down the road, making it bigger.

Problem is the skewed incentive structure. Rational miners will always include dust output with fees, because the eternal cost of UTXO is payed by the network and future miners, not the current/individual miner.

You could delegate the decision to the user with a rule like:

if (output<fee):
 limit lifetime of the UTXO to 10 years.
if (output>fee):
 unlimited lifetime

Then, when a user creates a transaction, he can decide whether he wants to have limited or unlimited lifetime. The rationale for limiting the lifetime for (output<fee) transactions is that they may have no inherent economic incentive to be spend.
