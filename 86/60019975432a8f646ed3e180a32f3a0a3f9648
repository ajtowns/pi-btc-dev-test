My current scripts use OP_IF and OP_NOTIF only after OP_EQUAL, except
for one place where they use OP_EQUAL ... OP_EQUAL... OP_ADD OP_IF
(where the two OP_EQUALs are comparing against different hashes, so only
0 or 1 of the two OP_EQUAL can return 1).

So there's no effect either way on the c-lightning implementation, at
least.

Thanks!
Rusty.
