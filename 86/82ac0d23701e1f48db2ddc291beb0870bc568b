I'll point out that getting a BIP for a feature is *not* a hard
requirement for deployment. I'd encourage you to go write up your BIP
document, give it a non-numerical name for ease of reference, and lobby
wallet vendors to implement it.

While I'll refrain from commenting on whether or not I think the feature
itself is a good idea, I really don't want people to get the impression
that we're gatekeepers for how people choose use Bitcoin.
