2015-10-08 Meeting Conclusions:

Ecosystem Warnings & Alerts:
There is a Bitcoin ecosystem threat with the potential to cause millions of
dollars in losses that needs higher visibility. It's not a Bitcoin Core /
Bitcoin network issue but most Javascript-based Bitcoin software is
affected. The issue, documented here
https://github.com/feross/buffer/pull/81, is about common, critical,
Javascript code that is broken and may cause the generation of incorrect
pubkeys (among other issues). If Javascript is part of your implementation,
you should read the referenced pull request.
