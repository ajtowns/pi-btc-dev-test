Using the good old saying; results in the past are no indication of the 
future.
I see a logic error in your thinking.

Your assumption that time is a better indicator is false. Naturally time 
itself is universal, but blocks are known by wallets too. Its just as good.

This assumption of yours leans heavily on block mining times, and that is
not guaranteed in the future.  Imagine one day half the miners dropping and 
blocks take much longer for a week or so.  Your assumptions just broke the 
mempool.
