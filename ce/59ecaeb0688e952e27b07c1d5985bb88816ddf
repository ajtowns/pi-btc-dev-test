I'm sorry you think it's unhelpful. It is nonetheless the best that can be
done within the constraints of the current Bitcoin protocol.

It's absent for the same reason it's absent for all the other protocol
BIPs: the ability to use a trusted third party is always present and a
possible answer for any problem in Bitcoin. So I figured it didn't need
stating.

How about adding the following sentence:

"If the above constraints are insufficient for your use case, you can
alternatively query a block explorer or other trusted third party to obtain
the same information".

Would that make the BIP clearer?
