I'm all for funding of Bitcoin development, but I suggest talking to Gavin
to find out what efforts would be the biggest win right now. I don't see
why separating wallet code from the main Bitcoin process would increase
node count, as the cost of running the node is almost all in keeping up
with transaction traffic and time spent in the wallet is likely to dominate
only for large merchants or exchanges.

That said, you can already do this today - just run an SPV wallet like
bitcoinj connected to your personal node. The wallet code in bitcoind won't
be used for anything.

There are lots of things that can be done, but the best way to approach
this is to get tightly written technical requirements from people in the
know, and then contract with developers. Bounty style development has the
risk of uncoordinated development that duplicates work and puts pressure on
Gavin or other maintainers to accept shoddy code due to the "first past the
post" winning criteria. Finding developers you trust and contracting with
them for well specified improvements minimises risk for everyone.
