Hi Greg,

The safest way to ensure everyone's protection to make sure *no one can do
anything*. Then we will ALL be safe ;).

>If so, please leave, you are compromising Bitcoin's security.

Ok, let's calm down.

>If I design a car that has a button that randomly causes the brakes to
give out if pressed, is that a good idea? Can I justify pushing for such a
"feature" just because it's "opt-in"?

It would be more like "should we allow a car on the road if we know
statistically that our brakes give out in every 1/100,000,000 cars"? There
is security risks with everything in life -- we need to quantify the risk
to see if it is worth taking. I think Paul has been pretty upfront about
the risks of his model. I think you did a good job of demonstrating it in
the email I cited too.

>It is how *insecure* systems are designed.

By your account bitcoin is already insecure then -- it allows anyone can
spend outputs that can be claimed by miners.

>Sure, happy to, as soon as I have it written up in detail.

I look forward to this!
