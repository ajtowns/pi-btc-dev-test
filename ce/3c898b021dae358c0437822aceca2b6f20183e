A personal attack had no place in the technical discussion, I moved it out.



Initially I asked him to please avoid personal attacks, but I thought better 
of it and edited my reply to just "ehm...".


The moderators failed to catch his aggressive tone while moderating my post 
(see archives) for being too aggressive.

I'm sure this message will also not be allowed through. I would not even blame 
the moderators since this, and Peters, messages were both off-topic.

I thank you for todays talks, it makes me certain of the thing I said this 
weekend on Reddit that this list is not a suitable place for all the different 
stakeholders to talk on a level playing field.

If any of you agree, please urge the approach that we replace the entire 
moderation team with a new one. This will be the least painful solution for 
everyone in the ecosystem.

Thanks again.
