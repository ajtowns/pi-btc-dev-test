Did you self-assigned a bip number?

Anyway, from your document:

"The existing (2015) Big Data analysis market is valued at around
$125bn according to market

research firm IDC. As the Bitcoin block chain replaces existing
payment systems and attracts

millions or hundreds of millions of users, the intrinsic value of the
data in the block chain

will increase and be attractive to data analytics businesses and block
chain start-ups."

Without even entering about details related to technical feasibility,
do you realize that you are proposing Bitcoin to become the most
orwellian money ever?
That this is the opposite of what many proposals and designs like
coinjoin try to achieve?

I think (hope?) that this idea doesn't have any chance of being
accepted by the Bitcoin community.
