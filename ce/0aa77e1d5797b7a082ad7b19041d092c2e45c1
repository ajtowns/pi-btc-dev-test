Yes, but then they should not be sponsors.

There's a very good reason why Wikipedia does not have advertisements. That is, the fear of advertisers influence on the neutral content. It is inevitably a corrupting influence. I want a good fun conference like the hackathon we just held.

Personally, i really don't mind sponsored speakers. If they have 
somewhat relevant topics they keep the event from becoming a "circlejerk".
for example i would really like to hear about payments innovation 
outside bitcoin.
