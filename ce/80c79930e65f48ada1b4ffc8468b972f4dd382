I'd like to garner consensus on whether anyone else thinks it desirable to
have a flag option for bitcoin to punish blocks for not including
transactions. I notice there are already pro-miner options, such as the
restricting the relaying of free transactions, and so including an option
to restrict relaying of blocks from "stingy" miners to balance against the
current bias, so that the default bitcoin client can be run as much
pro-miner as pro-non-miner.
