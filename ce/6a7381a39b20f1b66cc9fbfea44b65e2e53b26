Well, even in a centralized scheme you can have more users, more nodes and
more miners. Just having more does not mean that the system isn't
centralized, for example we can point to many centralized services such as
PayPal that have trillions of users.

Nobody claimed that moving to smaller blocks would "solve everything wrong
with Bitcoin".

Why not? That's exactly the sort of change that would be useful to do so,
in tandem with some forms of campaigning.

I am confused here; is that idea operating under an assumption (or rule)
like "we shouldn't count aggregate transactions as representing multiple
other transactions from other users" or something? I have seen this idea in
a few places, and it would be useful to get a fix on where it's coming
from. Does this belief extend to P2SH and multisig...?
