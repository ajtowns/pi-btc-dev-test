Here at the dark wallet conf there seems yo be rough consensus that replacement for fee bumping is a good thing and should be supported; I was talking to Taylor from hive specifically yesterday. The code is trivial on the node side of things and doesn't need consent of anymore than a small minority, and coinjoin forces wallets to handle double spends well anyway. I haven't heard anyone caring about zeroconf safety.

I'll be proposing it for "formal" inclusion in our wallet best practices guidelines.


Also fwiw apparently libbitcoin already implements a memory limited mempool and Amir is open to the idea of it using the satoshi consensus critical code for block validity. (therefor fairly safe mining) I wouldn't be surprised if libbitcoin based nodes start getting usage, and with a limited mempool it is very DoS attack safe for them to relay replacements regardless of miner support.
