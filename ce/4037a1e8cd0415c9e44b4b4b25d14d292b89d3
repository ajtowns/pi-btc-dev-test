Please be aware that your emails are being spamfoldered by Gmail. This is
because Yahoo has enabled DMARC enforcement for mail sent from Yahoo and
that renders it incompatible with Sourceforge mailing lists.

There are two fixes:

1) Don't use Yahoo.

2) The real fix which is, we should stop using Sourceforge mailing list
software

Fundamentally all Yahoo is saying with their policy is that rewriting of
mails sent from their service is not allowed. This is a highly reasonable
policy, akin to forbidding SSL MITM attacks, but for email.

There are several ways to be compatible with this policy: unfortunately
sf.net doesn't do any of them.
