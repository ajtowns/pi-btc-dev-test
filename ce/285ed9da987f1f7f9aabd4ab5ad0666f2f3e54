I'm curious whether my Non-Blocking network stack (BitDroid) isn't better
suited for detecting and tracking available peers. I have implemented
several benchmarks, including a simple peer counter listener, which would
have to be adapted to fit the DNS needs (open and check if a real peer is
listening). Being non-blocking it can open several hundreds of connections
to check reachability of the peers and at the same time keep a pool of peers
connected to listen for address broadcasts, with minimal overhead (single
thread, close to no context switches).

Just an idea :-)

Regards,
Chris
