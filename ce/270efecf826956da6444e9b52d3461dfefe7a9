One of the reasons I initiated the (now stalled) PayFile project was in
anticipation of this problem:

At some point if you want to actually download and validate the full block
chain from scratch, you will have to start paying for it I'm sure.

In the meantime:

   1. Getting headers-first implemented and rolled out everywhere would
   reduce the amount of redundant downloading and hopefully reduce transmit
   traffic network-wide.
   2. Implementing chain pruning would allow people to control upload
   bandwidth consumption by reducing the amount of disk storage they allow.
