If each "block" is really 512 blocks in sequence, then each "slot" is more
likely to be hit.  It effectively reduces the number of blocks by the
minimum run lengths.

ECC seemed cooler though.

Interesting too.

That's true.  Scaling up the transactions per second increases the chance
of data lost.

With side/tree chains, the odds of data loss in the less important chains
increases (though they are by definition lower value chains)
