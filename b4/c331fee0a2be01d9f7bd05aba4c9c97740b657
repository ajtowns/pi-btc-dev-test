Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Improvement Proposal
Message-ID: <CAKcm3BxdnuoFwc_Af3thKB32nPH7g5vgQsGu+1+L3D2472uYRg@mail.gmail.com>

Improvement Proposal

To allow users devices  (including mobile and/or IoT devices). to connect
and some how participate in the same BTC bock chain network without mining.

The incentive for this participants can be a lottery schema, running in
"parallel to mining in the same network" and in the block-chain.
Rewarding some lucky participant user (and/or miner?) randomly every
specific period of time.

Participants will pay the price on each connection round.
