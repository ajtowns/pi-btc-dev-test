Only if the peer is at the protocol level that allows the message:

compact blocks:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/protocol.h#L217-L242

fee filter:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/protocol.h#L211-L216

send headers:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/protocol.h#L204-L210

filters:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/protocol.h#L170-L196

had indicated they wouldn't support it, see, eg BIP 152's handshake. Not
sure why you consider this backwards incompatible, as I would say it's
pretty clearly allowing old nodes to communicate just fine.

No, it is not the same as BIP152. Control messages apart from BIP151 are
not sent until *after* the version is negotiated.

I assume that BIP151 is different in this manner because it has a desire
to negotiate encryption before any other communications, including version.
