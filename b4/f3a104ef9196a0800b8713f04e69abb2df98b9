Subject: [Bitcoin-development] snailmail bitcoin client
Message-ID: <CABipEAv2x+zLN8GD=hojZfj2CKP0qot+ZjFS=MjAyAoc8AkNvw@mail.gmail.com>

Here is a business idea:
customers send you a bitcoin transaction printed on paper.
You scan the transaction and broadcast it to the network.
Your fee could be the greater of some minimum or like 0.01% of the
transaction value.
The fee could be sent as just another paper transaction, it could even just
be cash.

You could expand into a snailmail based email or publishing platform.
Customers send you a letter.
You make the letter available in one or more of the following forms:
1. as a single webpage
2. sent via email to a specified address
3. in a data dump along with all open letters received that day / week /
month / year / or decade.
