I have expanded the BIP so that it additionally applies to BIP32 master seeds of sizes 128, 256, and 512 bits.

The most significant change versus the previous version is how the coefficients of the polynomials are constructed. Previously they were SHA-256 digests. Now they are SHA-512 digests, modulo a prime number that is selected depending on the size of the secret.
