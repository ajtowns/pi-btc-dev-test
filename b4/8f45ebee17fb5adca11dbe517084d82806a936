Hi slush,

Thank you for your new proposal; it seems to be a compromise.

@Christophe Biocca:
If the wordlist becomes part of the standard, then we will run into
problems of collisions once users ask for wordlists in every language.

IMO the right approach is to implement checksums that do not depend
on the wordlist (eg the 'brute force' method, Hash(mnemonic||1) mod 2^k 
== 0 )
this would also allow us to implement sipa's variable stretching proposal.

I understand this is not possible because of the computational
requirements of devices such as trezor.

I am leaning toward considering these devices as a nonstandard case,
instead of enforcing a given wordlist in the standard.

Thomas
