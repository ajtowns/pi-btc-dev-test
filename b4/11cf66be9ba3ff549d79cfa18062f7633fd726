I ran into this problem while auditing Litecoin actually: the tools to
audit that a set of git patches/merges actually match upstream (or
downstream for litecoin) don't really exist yet. In this case manually
checking that individual files matched would have probably worked, but
it'd be good to automate the process.

I can't say I've looked into any of this in detail, but you're right to
bring up the issue.
