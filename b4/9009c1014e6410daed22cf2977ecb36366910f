That is effectively what segwit does, upto engineering minutia and
compatibility details.

Segwit does not serialize transactions in to a data structure where
signatures are separated from the rest of the transaction data; this
is a misunderstanding.  The "segregated" refers to them being excluded
from the TXID.   The serialization of segwit on the p2p network in
transactions and in blocks encodes the witness field inside the
transactions, immediately prior to the nlocktime field.
