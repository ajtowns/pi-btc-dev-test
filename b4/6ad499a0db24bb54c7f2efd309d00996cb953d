The merchant wants to include a fee to ensure the transaction is 
confirmed which is dependent on the fee per kilobyte, but they don't 
want to pay unexpectedly high fees. So what about including a 
min_fee_per_kilobyte and a max_fee in PaymentDetails describing what 
fees the merchant will pay.  The sender would be expected to respect the 
min_fee_per_kilobyte but if the result exceeds max_fee the sender would 
be agreeing to pay the extra fee (exterior fees).  The sender might also 
agree to pay fees in excess of min_fee_per_kilobyte.

The sender would deduct the interior or merchant fees from the first output.

The UI could show the payment "price" which would match the sum of 
original outputs.  It would show the merchant fees (interior) and sender 
fees (exterior) if there are any.  The UI should always show fees so 
users learn to expect them for all transactions.

This should allow the merchant to pay fees in most cases while not 
having to pay excessive fees if the sender wants to use some large 
transaction.  If max_fee is 0 the sender would be expected to pay all fees.
