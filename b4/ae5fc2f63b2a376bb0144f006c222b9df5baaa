It is analog to getting assigned a random part (based on IP) of the hashspace and then only verify transactions within this fraction.

But, there is in fact a subtle difference: If anyone can choose to verify at random, you will see lazy implementations where random means none, and as it is random you cannot, from the outside, judge if a node is taking part in the validation work or if it just benefitting from others announcements. In the hash space part, you can monitor peers and see if they did not tell you about a failed validation and then disconnect from them as they are either malicious or lazy.

Besides from that, I like a setup where we scream about failed verifications, but keep a low profile on things that actually verifies...
