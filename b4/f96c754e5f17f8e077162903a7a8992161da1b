Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Barry Silbert segwit agreement
Message-ID: <CAEgR2PFGaTn8tqC8fMG9-9E31LauX2erUirx_6vURNrXSgYzLw@mail.gmail.com>

I couldn't agree more. It would require however for the Devs to throw their
weight behind this with a lot of momentum. Spoonnet has been under
development for quite some time now. Counter offering SegWit plus Spoonnet
12-24 months later would be a very progressive stance that I think would
catch the interest of large swaths of the community. I'd be curious to hear
Johnson's opinion on this. How much more testing would his proposal require?
