Given the Sourceforge list server exploded and unsubscribed the majority of
the old list, we decided to move forward with the planned list move in
roughly 50 minutes from now.  9pm UTC or 2pm PDT this list will be
permanently shut down with auto-reject on all posts.

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev
Please subscribe to the new list.  It will be opened for posts shortly
after 9pm UTC after the final archive import.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting
Do not panic if your post does not immediately reach the new list.  Your
first post to the new list may be delayed by 5+ minutes due to greylisting.

Please chat in Freenode #bitcoin-dev if you have any questions or concerns.
