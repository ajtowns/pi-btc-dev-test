A new message can be added to the p2p relay network, similar to tx and alert 
broadcasts, that allow miners to publish/update their policy URI signed by the 
key in question. Counter-DDoS rules could decline to relay or store URIs for 
keys that haven't been published in - or achieved statistical significance in 
- the last N blocks.
