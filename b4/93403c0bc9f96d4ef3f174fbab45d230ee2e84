Alex,

With all due respect, right now the biggest challenge facing Bitcoin is not technical but political. I would love to see this list go back to technical discussions, but unfortunately, until this political stuff is resolved, even technical discussion is purely philosophical as there?s little chance of actually making good progress on consensus?which in a space where everything depends on consensus pretty much makes everything else moot.

However the sheer volume of email and proportion of discussion that is more philosophical than technical has rendered this list almost unusable for its primary purpose of technical discussion related to Bitcoin development.  Many of us share the blame for letting the discourse run off topic to such a degree, and we hope that an appeal for individual self restraint will allow this list to return to a higher signal-to-noise ratio.

Although such a debate may be worthwhile it should be taken to another forum for discussion.  Every email you send is received by hundreds of developers who value their time as much as you value yours.  If your intended audience isn't really the majority of them, perhaps private communication would be more appropriate.
