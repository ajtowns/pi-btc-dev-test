On MSG_MEMTX:  The current version has a much higher Just Works value.

On empty "inv":  It is generally better to do something
unconditionally, than have a response generated only under certain
conditions.

And Alan is correct to note that unknown messages are ignored
(intentionally, for expansion).  However, unconditionally returning a
response has little to do with feature probing/discovery.  It is
simply a clear, deterministic indication that processing is complete,
for each invocation.
