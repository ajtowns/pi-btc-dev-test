getinfo does a bunch of stuff; with 0.9 you will be able to use
getbestblockhash instead.

If you just want to see if bitcoind is responding to RPC requests, then
'help getinfo' would do the trick without acquiring any locks.

RE: running into the maximum-of-4-keepalive-requests : simple workaround is
to run with -rpcthreads=11 (or however many keepalive connections you need
to support).  I agree that the rpc code should be smarter; making the last
rpc thread ignore keepalive and always disconnecting should be a fairly
simple patch, and "patches welcome."
