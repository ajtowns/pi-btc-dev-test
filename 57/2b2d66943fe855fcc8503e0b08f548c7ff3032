I'm rather perplexed about this proposal. What exactly is wrong with
the existing BIPs process? I mean, it seems to me anyone can publish a
BIP pretty easily in the BIPs repository. There doesnt seems to be any
real barrier to entry whatsoever. I know there have been all manner of
aspersions, but having just written two BIPs there was no friction at
all.

Whether the ecosystem adopts a BIP is another question of course, but
that's out of scope of the BIPs project anyhow. Take BIP101
controversial as it gets, but it's there. Whether Bitcoin implementers
implement it is another kettle of fish and a matter for each project
to decide. It's absolutely NOT the realm of the BIPs project itself.
Bitcoin Core does not make any consensus critical changes with a BIP.
Where one seeks to establish certain standards, say for privacy, a BIP
would be appropriate so the ecosystem can harmonise methodology across
the board.

The status of a BIP is not really determined by anyone, it's by
adoption - that's where consensus happens. There's a little legroom
around this but I'm not entirely sure what you are trying to solve.
Yes the process is loose, but is it broken? There have been a flood of
BIPs added recently with zero bureaucracy or friction.

BIP0001 is the BIP that defines the BIP process. Interestingly enough
the only BIP that might be controversial is in fact a BIP to change
the way BIPs are handled!

So I'd really prefer to start this conversation with a breakdown of
what you think is broken first before tackling what may or may not
need fixing. I would be very cautious bringing "administrative"
burdens to the process or evicting common sense from the proceedings.
Much of the debates around consensus building seem to negate the
importance of common sense and the simple fact that "it's obvious when
you see it".

I'm sure there can be improvements, but for me personally, I need to
see what is broken before I can make any judgement on a potential way
forward, and if it's not broken, we should leave it alone.
