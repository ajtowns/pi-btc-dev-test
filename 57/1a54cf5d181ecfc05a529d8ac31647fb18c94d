Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Miners are struggling with blocks far smaller
 than 750KB blocks and resorting to SPV mining

That's not a valid conclusion. Just because you observe a miner producing
empty blocks doesn't mean he is SPV mining.

There can be many reasons for mining on an empty block even after having
fully verified the previous block. And therefore these reasons would be
completely independent of block size. You cannot conclude that miners are
struggling with a certain block size.

For example, there are reasons rooted in the mining hardware and mining
software itself, which have nothing to do with the node software, in
particular not with block propagation, verification or transaction
selection. See also https://github.com/BlockheaderNonce2/bitcoin/wiki where
this was warned about. The effect can be expected to become more pronounced
in the future.
