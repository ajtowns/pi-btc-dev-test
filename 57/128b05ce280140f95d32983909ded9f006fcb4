Thank you for your reply Andreas,

I can assure you that I have many motivations for activating SegWit.

Before studding ASICBOOST I wanted to activate SegWit as it is a wonderful upgrade for Bitcoin. It seems to me that virtually the entire Bitcoin Ecosystem agrees with me.  Except for around 67% of the mining hash-rate who very conspicuously refuse to signal for it?s activation. 

So, I started searching for the motivations of such a large amount of the mining hash-rate holding a position that isn?t at-all represented in the wider Bitcoin Community. My study of ASICBOOST lead to a ?bingo? moment:  If one assumes that the 67% of the hash rate that refuse to signal for SegWit are using ASICBOOST. The entire picture of this political stalemate became much more understandable.

This only strengthened my resolve to activate SegWit: not only is SegWit great, it partially mitigates a very serious security vulnerability.

This is why I call into question why you would suggest:

?This proposal is unnecessarily conflating two contentious issues and will attract criticism of self serving motivation.?

1. I am not conflating the issues.  I would argue that very fact that SegWit has not been activated yet is directly because of CVE-2017-9230.
2. I have no reason to believe that SegWit is contentious, except for the attackers who it would frustrate.
3. I have no negative responses to my endeavours to get ASICBOOST as regarded as a legitimate security vulnerability.  This would suggest that it is not contentious in the wider technical community.

If SegWit is NOT contentious within the technical community and it is NOT contentious to regard CVE-2017-9230 as a credible security vulnerability. Then using it as partial security fix for a security vulnerability SHOULD NOT be contentious.

If you believe that SegWit is contentious within the technical community.  Or you believe CVE-2017-9230 should not be regarded as a credible security vulnerability. Then I would logically agree with you that we should separate the issues so that we may gain consensus. However, I just don?t see this as the case.

Cameron.
