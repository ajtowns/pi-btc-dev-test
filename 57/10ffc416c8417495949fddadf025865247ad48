I stand with satoshi here.  No need to add more stuff to the network
protocol, a well-connected node can easily monitor the miners(/network)
for double-spends and alert whoever may need to know that the
transaction should not be accepted.  True, not everyone has the
resources to try to implement this, however the number of people who
have the resources to implement a Bitcoin storefront and not implement
this (vs those who will/do use a payment processor who handles such
things), I would think, are fairly small.
Additionally, keep in mind that many storefronts don't need to care if a
transaction confirms in 10 seconds or 1 hour.  Only digital goods and
physical purchases could benefit from such speed increases.

This is exactly what I've been suggesting this whole time.
