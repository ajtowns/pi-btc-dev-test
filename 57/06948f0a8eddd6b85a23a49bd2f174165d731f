This has been discussed many times before; there are *severe* downsides to
making it possible for transactions to become invalid after the fact.

Perhaps one or two bits can be used to specify an exponent; a large range seems more useful than high precision. For instance a merchant doesn't care if the customer pays within 10:00:00 minutes or 10:00:01 minutes and you wouldn't care if your address is valid 50 years or 50 years and 3 minutes. This point may be mute if minute level resolution is not practical.

Note that "large range" is a requirement driven by the fact that expiry times
will inevitably be specified absolutely, not relatively: when the range runs
out you need to upgrade the standard. Better to use another character and use a
range that won't run out any time soon.

This wouldn't create a need for more checksum space.
