Pieter, you either misunderstood or misquoted Gavin here.
The tradeoffs Gavin talks about are about trusting your own node or using a 
centralized system (as the two extremes in a spectrum).

Your answer talks about something completely different. Not sure how your 
answer fits in this conversation, although, you do seem to use these 
misunderstandings often to push your own position in a way that to the naive 
reader it sounds like others agree with you.  Please try to be more concise 
and on-topic.
