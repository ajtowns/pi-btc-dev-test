I think our common goal should be to standardize DNS records holding
Bitcoin addresses, because they are going to be used by both Netki and
Electrum.

You and Ricardo may find it useful to have other types of lookups, such
as Namecoin, and that's fine with me, but I do not want that to slow
down or stall the current standardisation effort, because Namecoin
lookups are clearly not an option for lightweight wallets. That is what
I meant by 'not part of the standard'; let's work on what we have in
common :)
