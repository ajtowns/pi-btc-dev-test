Interesting project, Kristov. Two more ideas for fuzzing bitcoin txs:
- random bit flipping from valid txs
- random tx script generators:
  - from a grammar
  - from a stochastic grammar
  - from a random sequence of opcodes

I've made some really small experiments on fuzzing in the past [1][2], and
I'm interested in helping out.

Best,
Manuel
