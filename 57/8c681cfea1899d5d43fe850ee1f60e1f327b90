I see.

But is it really necessary to soft fork over this issue?  Why not just make
it a relay rule?  Miners are already incentivized to modify transactions to
drop excess witness data and/or prioritize (versions of) transactions based
on their cost.  If a miner wants to mine a block with excess witness data,
it is mostly their own loss.
