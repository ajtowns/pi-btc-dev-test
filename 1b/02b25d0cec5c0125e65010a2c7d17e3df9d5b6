yes, sorry, I mean the domain name corresponding to the TXT record.
it's called 'alias' in the context of OpenAlias.

What do you mean by "under some new roots" ?

If I believe Netki, there is enough people who want to have a Bitcoin
address stored in DNS, for at least one company to thrive. :)

All I am proposing is a new usage for these already existing DNS
records; not only to receive BTC, but also to sign requests with them.

Heh, pastebin + base64 encoding the PR could work. However, it might
violate their ToS. More seriously, there might be some legal issues for
a company willing to provide that kind of service.

Re QR codes: 150 bytes, using base43 encoding, is not too bad.
