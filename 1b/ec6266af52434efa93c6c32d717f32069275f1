Subject: [bitcoin-dev] bitcoin-dev list etiquette
Message-ID: <CAPWm=eVr9CHPzTvDZC5T9k0jc6gqorXxvNB39dV5ZBcxKAugow@mail.gmail.com>

This is a message that I wrote and had hoped that all the core devs would
sign on to, but I failed to finish organizing it.  So I'll just say it from
myself.

There has been a valuable discussion over the last several months regarding
a hard fork with respect to block size.  However the sheer volume of email
and proportion of discussion that is more philosophical than technical has
rendered this list almost unusable for its primary purpose of technical
discussion related to Bitcoin development.  Many of us share the blame for
letting the discourse run off topic to such a degree, and we hope that an
appeal for individual self restraint will allow this list to return to a
higher signal-to-noise ratio.
-Please consider the degree to which any email you send is related to
technical development before sending it.
-Please consider how many emails you are sending to this list regarding the
same topic.
This list is not appropriate for an endless back and forth debate on the
philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin.  Although such a debate may be
worthwhile it should be taken to another forum for discussion.  Every email
you send is received by hundreds of developers who value their time as much
as you value yours.  If your intended audience isn't really the majority of
them, perhaps private communication would be more appropriate.

Thanks,
Alex
