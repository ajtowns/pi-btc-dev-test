It is also vulnerable to miners fiddling with timestamps in a way that could prevent or delay activation - for example by only advancing the block timestamp by 1 second you would never meet the threshold (although this would come a the penalty of hiking the difficulty dramatically).

If there are miners that start doing 1 second timestamp advances, it would be
simpler (and probably safer) to require a minimum block time spacing of say
30 seconds or 1 minute, and orphan blocks that are too close in time and more
than say an hour behind real-time.

I cannot picture any realistic scenario in which an attempt to block activation
in this way is in anything other than a very expensive temper tantrum for any
miners foolish enough to attempt it.

It *might* be a delay tactic as a 'nuclear option' attack vector for a mining
cabal to run up the difficulty so high as to make it impractical to mine any
new blocks after the adjustment, but there are plenty of altcoins that have
hardforked and gotten along just fine after the same kind of thing due to
profit-switching pools.
