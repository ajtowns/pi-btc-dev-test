One thought I had reading through this exchange: I think the general
public is becoming more aware of the "hacker with a long range
antenna" sort of attack, since credit cards are getting microchips
that can be scanned. There's a few videos I've seen of white hat
hackers demonstrating how a suitcase-sized apparatus carried by
someone walking down the street can scan and make charges on cards in
people's pockets as the attacker brushes past. Hence RFID-blocking
sleeves/wallets are on the market, such that your smart credit card
can't make a purchase while its in your wallet. Is a RFID-blocking
wallet also NFC-blocking? Irregardless of whatever "future cash" you
choose to carry (be it credit card or bitcoin card/coin/cash), perhaps
its the wallet/purse that needs an upgrade, to ensure your money
doesn't spend itself while its in your pocket, but you can easily
remove it and spend it conveniently?
