A segwit supporting server would be required to support relaying segwit
transactions, although a non-segwit server could at least inform a wallet
of segwit txns observed, even if it doesn't relay all information necessary
to validate.

Non segwit servers and wallets would continue operations as if nothing had
occurred.
If this means essentially that a soft fork deployment of SegWit will
require SPV wallet servers to change their logic (or risk not being able to
send payments) then it does seem to me that a hard fork to deploy this non
controversial change is not only cleaner (on the data structure side) but
safer in terms of the potential to affect the user experience.
