I think it would be great to have more nonce space with less merkle
calculation; keeping track of all possible versions of a block already
takes real RAM, real computation. Being able to change one bit in the
header and send out a new block for checking would ease our pool server
work by a real amount, somewhat on the work generation side, but also on
the checking old work side; we'll have a lot fewer unique transaction /
coinbase sets to hold on to for checking when we get back a solution.
