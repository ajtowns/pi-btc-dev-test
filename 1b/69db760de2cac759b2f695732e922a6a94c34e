Anticipating ongoing hashrate rise shows that you have not yet thought about moving outside of the current greed model, a model wherein mining will consume all available resources within the colony's objective just to spread as far as possible with each new miner bringing diminishing individual returns and shortening the life of Earth for no additional gain. Greed model := bacteria.

Subject: Re: [bitcoin-dev] Selfish Mining Prevention

I discussed this more at bitcointalk:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4998410.0

The attacks I'm interested in preventing are not only selfish mining
and collusion, but also more subtle attacks like block withholding,
and in general anything that aims to drive out the competition in
order to increase hashrate fraction. I also scrapped the idea of
changing the block subsidies, and I am only focuses on fees.

You can read more about the motivation and details in the bitcointalk
thread, but my proposal in short would be to add the concept of
"reserve fees". When a user makes a transaction, for each txout
script, they can add parameters that specify the fraction of the total
fee that is held in "reserve" and the time it is held in "reserve"
(can set a limit of 2016 blocks). This "reserve" part of the fee will
be paid to miners if the hashrate rises. So if hashrate is currently h
and peak hashrate (from past year) is p, then for each period (1 day),
a new hashrate is calculated h1, and if h1 > h, then the fraction
(h1-h)/p from the reserve fees created in the past 2016 blocks will be
released to miners for that period (spread out over the 144 blocks in
that period). And this will keep happening as long as hashrate keeps
rising, until the "contract" expires, and the leftover part can be
used by the owner of the unspent output, but it can only be used for
paying fees, not as inputs for future transactions (to save on block
space).

This should incentivize miners to not drive out the competition, since
if they do, there will be less of these reserve fees given to miners.
Yes in the end the miners will get all the fees, but with rising
hashrate they get an unconditional subsidy that does not require
transactions, thus more space for transactions with fees.

I can make a formal BIP and pull request, but I need to know if there
is interest in this. Now fees don't play such a large part of the
block reward, but they will get more important, and this change
wouldn't force anything (would be voluntary by each user), just miners
have to agree to it with a soft fork (so they don't spend from the
anyone-can-spend outputs used for reserve fees). Resource requirements
for validation are quite small I believe.
