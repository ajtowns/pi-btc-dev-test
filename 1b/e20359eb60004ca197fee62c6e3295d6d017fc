I'm not suggesting removing the anti-DoS protections.  I'm suggesting that
replaced transaction require a fee increase of at least the min-fee-rate
times the size of all the transactions being ejected (in addition to the
other proposed requirements).

Just ask rhavar.  It happens regularly.

Not many wallets let you spend unconfirmed outputs that you didn't create.

The problem is with institutional wallets sweeping incoming payments.  It
seems that in practice they are happy to sweep unconfirmed outputs.

Setting all of the above aside for a moment.  We need to understand that
rational miners are going to prefer to transactions with higher package fee
rates regardless of whatever your personal preferred RBF policy is.  If we
do not bring the RBF policy to alignment with what is economically
rational, then miners are going to change their own policies anyways,
probably all in slightly different ways.  It behooves everyone to develop a
reasonable standard RBF policy, that is still robust against possible DoS
vectors, and aligns with miner incentives, so that all participants know
what behaviour they can reasonably expect.  It is simply a bonus that this
change in RBF policy also partially mitigates the problem of pinned
transactions.
