Hi Mike,

Thanks! I believe it is better to keep the current discussion on
bitcoin-dev, though.

I would love to work with Netki. However, it's not clear to me what they
are selling. OpenAlias is an open standard, not a company. In contrast,
Netki have very long Terms of Service, that do not help understand what
part of their solution is open-source, and what is the product. They
surely know about OpenAlias, it would be nice to hear what they think
about it.

What I propose does not rely on email. Please read again.
I am proposing an alternative way to sign BIP70 requests. This is
independent from the communication channel used to send/receive them.

Hardly anyone uses email certificates today, so I don't think it would
affect a lot of users. In contrast, it would increase the security of
all users who don't use email certs, because they may receive a payment
request signed by an email cert.

If your email account is hacked and someone else gets a certificate in
your name, you'd be unable to *know* about it, because they would use a
different CA.

That does not look so... not until (1) BIP70 wallets integrate with
https://crt.sh, (2) you convince that service to index email certs (3)
you convince all CAs to report all email certs they issue to crt.sh.

Good luck with that!

Again, that olution is for email only. We both agree that this is
solving yesterdays problems, so there's no need to discuss that.
