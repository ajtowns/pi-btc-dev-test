Mark,

That's a great development. Virtualbox has less requirements with regard to
specific CPU flags, KVM is really slow without hw virtualization whereas
Virtualbox is usable on older CPUs.

It also means I can do gitian builds together with other running virtualbox
instances. KVM and Virtualbox don't play along well.
