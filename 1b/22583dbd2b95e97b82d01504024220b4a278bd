I like this idea a lot.

To add: I think it is a bug and security risk if pooled-solo or (current
pooled miners) do not add randomness to their extraNonce2 (like 128-bits of
it).  For privacy and to avoid various hostile-pre-mining attacks it should
be done this way.  Lack of the self-chosen challenge field is the reason
Satoshi's first year mining is marked (plus forgetting to reset the
counter).  (Bitcoind I believe considered the direct miners key as defense
enough as a stand in for self-chosen challenge, which has a few problems).

The base counter I think is only 32-bits, the extranonce2 itself being
random can be incremented while still looking random.  But incrementing
extranonce directy while initializing it to 0 is not good (per previous
mining extranone marked coins bug - is that even fixed?)

(You dont want to  reveal the miners power in his pool shares, if the full
counter is revealed with no randomness it also reveals how many iterations
he can do since the block start).
