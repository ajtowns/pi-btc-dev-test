Although not having to download the whole blockchain to operate a
trust-less full node is theoretically possible it is not clear that
they will work in practice or would be accepted, and we certainly
don't have that now.
So I don't think future potential theoretical scalability improvements
are solid arguments in favor of supporting proof of publication now.

My point is that this seems relevant to competing mining policies in general.

I understand that proof of publication is not the same thing as
regular timestamping, but requiring permanent storage in the
blockchain is not the only way you can implement proof of publication.
Mark Friedenbach proposes this:

Store hashes, or a hash root, and soft-fork that blocks are only
accepted if (a) the data tree is provided, or (b) sufficient work is
built on it and/or sufficient time has passed

This way full nodes can ignore the published data until is sufficiently buried.

The attacker was of course economically irrational in my previous
example for which you didn't have any complain. So I think we can
agree that a merged mined separated chain is more secure than a
non-merged mined separated chain and that attacking a merged mined
chain is not free.
By not being clear on this you're indirectly promoting non-merged
mined altchains as a better option than merged mined altchains, which
is what I don't think is responsible on your part.

I agree that we disagree on additional non-validated data in the main
chain vs merged mined chains as the best way to implement additional
features.
But please, you don't need to spread and maintain existing myths about
merged mining to make your case. If you insist on doing it I will
start to think that the honesty of your arguments is not something
important to you, and you just prefer to try to get people on your
side by any means, which would be very disappointing.
