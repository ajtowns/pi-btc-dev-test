So if I leave my window open while I'm out and there's some cash on my
desk, visible from the street, then every passer by now has a
custodial relationship with me?

Your example of a malicious software update seems more akin to a theft
like that (which is clearly not a custodial relationship) rather than
a true custodial relationship.
