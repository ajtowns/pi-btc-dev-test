There could not be a worse timing than this for those in China (3-4am), 
Japan/Korea (4-5am), and Australia (3-6am depends on which part of the 
country). Maybe we have no dev in this part of the planet? Is there any 
chance to review the timing in a weekly or monthly basis (also with a 
doodle vote?)

Will there be any agenda published before the meetings? If I'm really 
interested in the topics, I'll have some reasons to get up in the middle 
of the night.
