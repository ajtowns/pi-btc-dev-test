Bah, I don?t know if you?re just trolling me, Hector?but I?ll give you the benefit of the doubt and act like you aren?t.

We already have much more efficient, far more scalable systems that allow this kind of cooperation you speak of without the inconveniences of blockchains and such. These incidents do, fortunately, present some of the better sides of humanity?but?the design of the network *broke* - and for reasons that are now well understood to be only worsened by larger blocks. These incidents are *not supposed to happen* - and if they do, it means we?ve botched something up and need to fix it. And by fix it, I mean fix the protocol so that given our best understanding of things in the present we can significantly reduce the potential for its occurrence in the future.

The correct incentives here were not due to people potentially losing a lot of money. The incentives here were well-intentioned altruism. Some miners lost money as a result of these actions?and they didn?t put up a fight. if you want to design a system around the assumption that this is how all such incidents will be resolved, please don?t spoil this for the rest of us.

They were both caused by consensus disagreement that directly or indirectly were brought about by bigger blocks. There is *strong* evidence?and a great deal of theory explaining it?that links larger blocks with the propensity for consensus forks that require manual intervention.

The very model upon which the security of the system is based *broke*?as in, we were only able to recover because a few individuals deliberately manipulated the consensus rules to fix it manually. Shouldn?t we more highly prioritize fixing the issues that can lead to these incidents than trying to increase throughput? Increasing block size cannot possibly make these forking tendencies better?but it very well could make them worse.

This debate has forgotten the current and future users of Bitcoin. Most of them think the hit to node count in the short term preferable to making it expensive and competitive to transact.

The incentives of Bitcoin remain, so everyone's decentralised decision throughout the system, from miners, merchants and users, will continue to act according to those incentives.
