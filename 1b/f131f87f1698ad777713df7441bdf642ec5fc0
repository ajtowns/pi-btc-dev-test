Hi Alan,

What you describe in the ultimate blockchain compression I have already
coded the authenticated datastructure part of in libcoin
(https://github.com/libcoin/libcoin) - next step is to include a p2pool
style mining, where a parallel chain serves several purposes:
1. to validate the root hash at a higher frequency than the 10 min
2. to enable distributed mining, easily (part of libcoind)
3. to utilize the soft fork by defining the root hash in coinbase blocks
as v3 and once we cross the limit all blocks are v3.

I will have a closer look at you bitcoin talk post to see how well my
approach and ideas fit to yours.

Michael
