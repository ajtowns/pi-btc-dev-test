Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Multi-hash mining with Bitcoin holder voting
Message-ID: <CAGNXQMQObxgi1Tg-o=TvC3FKVg5GOQFzBnsuZTy1g0hSDPEbiA@mail.gmail.com>

Further to recent posts to this list concerning mining with more than one
hash function, Adam Perlow and me have a (longish) proposal/analysis on
combining multi-hash with bitcoin stake voting on what the mix of hashes
should be. Two novelties are:

* Targeting a ratio of blocks mined under each hash function, in a similar
way to difficulty targeting.
* Analysis of voting on this ratio in terms of "voting on a simplex", using
extant research to choose a good method of doing so.

One point about mining under multiple hashes is that it offers existing
miners a way back in after a contentious hard fork. Shame to waste all that
hardware?
