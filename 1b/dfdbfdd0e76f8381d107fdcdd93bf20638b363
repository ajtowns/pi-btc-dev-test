In that sense, no but they help people understand the system (e.g. so
they don't go look at implementations and confuse that the activations
they expect are simply not there); and they aid other implementations
in understanding what other people have already analyzed and concluded
was safe. You could certainly get an analysis wrong for one of these
things.
