Hey,

I heard there is a fuzzer in the works? Where can I find more details of this? I'm going to write one for libbitcoin, but if one already exists then I'd rather build on and use that.

Something simple like:
- Set previous block hash, set current target
- Start hashing
- Connect and send to specified host (i.e localhost)

That way I can force re-organisations and stress the blockchain algorithm. Should be trivial for me to build, but worth asking anyway :)

Thanks
