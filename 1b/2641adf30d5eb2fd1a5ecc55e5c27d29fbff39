Yes; I appreciate that.  It's the very point I'm making.  A node can choose 
what work to do, and should have a way of forwarding the results of that work 
to other nodes.  Transaction verifification is the main one.

Once a negative-announce message exists, it wouldn't be hard to have the other 
two you need as well: positive-announce and neutral-announce.  At present we 
have only neutral-announce.  However, as the need for super nodes and 
distributed verification gets bigger, having the forwarder able to offer an 
opinion on the quality of a transaction seems ideal to me.  Dishonesty will 
get you isolated pretty quickly if you use positive-announce and negative-
announce to lie.

The problem with this is that it requires a web of trust as well as a web of 
connections.  The only way to gain an advantage from this classified 
forwarding is if you have some way of assigning enough trust so that you can 
forward a classified transaction _without_ checking it yourself.  That doesn't 
sound like an easy problem though.
