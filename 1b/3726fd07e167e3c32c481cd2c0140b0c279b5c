Why would there be an iteration count? The payer would handle that,
wouldn't they?

If the use case is:  I give the Foundation a "here's where to pay my
salary" PaymentRequest, maybe with several Outputs each having a different
xpubkey, then it seems to me the Foundation's wallet software should take
care of iterating.

(either saving state, so it knows it used xpubkey+10 last month and should
use xpubkey+11 this month, or maybe it knows I'm paid monthly and just uses
xpubkey+(number_of_months_from_date_in_original_payment_request).
