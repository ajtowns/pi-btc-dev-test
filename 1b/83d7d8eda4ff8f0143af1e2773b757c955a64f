Pieter, what's actually happening is that the bitcoin-core release has
become a Schelling point in the consensus game:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling_point

Due to the strong incentives for consensus, everyone is looking for an
obvious reference point that they think everyone else will also pick, even
though the point itself isn't critical, only that everyone agree on
whatever point is picked. Like it or not, the bitcoin-core release, and by
extension it's committers have a great degree of influence over what the
community as a whole decides to do. If core screws things up badly enough,
yes, the community will settle on some other focal point for consensus, but
the cost and risk of doing so is high, so there is indeed unavoidable moral
hazard for whoever has control over any such focus point.
