Hi Peter,
We reported this as CVE-2017-12842, although it may have been known by
developers before us.
There are hundreds of SPV wallets out there, without even considering other
more sensitive systems relying on SPV proofs.
As I said we, at RSK, discovered this problem in 2017. For RSK it's very
important this is fixed because our SPV bridge uses SPV proofs.
I urge all people participating in this mailing list and the rest of the
Bitcoin community to work on this issue for the security and clean-design
of Bitcoin.

My suggestion is to use in the version bits 4 bits indicating the tree
depth (-1), as a soft-fork, so
00=1 depth,
0F = 16 depth (maximum 64K transactions). Very clean.

The other option is to ban transaction with size lower or equal to 64.

Best regards,
 Sergio.
