If you decide to implement this in an existing or new bitcoinj based
wallet, then I'm happy to give you pointers on how to do it. Making
one-off, cross platform app specific wallets is pretty easy these days. For
2-of-3 dispute mediation transactions they'd start out being kind of
specialist so asking people to move money from their general spending
wallet into dispute mediation app isn't unthinkable. Eventually general
purpose wallets would integrate protocol, UI ideas and maybe code.

At least, that's how I'd do it.
