Subject: [Bitcoin-development] SPV client in pure JavaScript?
Message-ID: <B4D8D241-E758-4806-8B12-C9A78BF1470B@grabhive.com>

To those of you in the know about modern browser tech:

Does it seem at all conceivable that an SPV wallet could be built entirely in JavaScript? And if indeed it is within the realm of the possible, how would such a thing be safely distributed for use? Would a signed Chrome Plugin be an ideal vehicle?
