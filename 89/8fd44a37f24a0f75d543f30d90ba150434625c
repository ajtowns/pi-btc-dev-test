Actually, I have to think about this merge-mining thing a bit more. I'm
starting to think it's better to do without merge-mining at all. As I
explained in the forum post, the parent will put the hashes of its children
headers as transactions inside its blocks. Thus parents will have an
incentive to validate the children not by merge mining, but by collecting
fees from the children for putting those transactions inside (fees that can
be spent at the children chains). So, ya no merge mining needed for my
proposal. But I will think about it a bit more :)
