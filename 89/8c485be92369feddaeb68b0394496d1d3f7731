Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Reusable addresses
Message-ID: <20140116234811.168530@gmx.com>

I'm very pleased that my old idea is getting some traction and that I have been appropriately credited!
I also think the term "reusable addresses" is preferable to anything to do with "stealth" for the reasons mentioned.

You should note that the privacy guarantees they provide are not that strong but their limitations have been adequately discussed elsewhere.

On an unrelated note - I'd like to solicit some help in restoring access to my Bytecoin account on http://bitcointalk.org/

Cheers!
