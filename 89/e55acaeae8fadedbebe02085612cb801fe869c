Emphasis on "likely", at best. Forcing you adversary to rely on uncertain statistics is a huge improvement over the status quo. Secondly your example is of a new block; the more general concern is determining where a given transaction originated. In the best of circumstances determining the origin of a few hundred bytes of days interspersed in dozens of kB/s of buffered data streams is very difficult and expensive even without padding and/or random delay features.

Again, I've spoken to people like Jacob Applebaum about this who have a solid understanding of what the NSA is actually capable of, and they've confirmed the above. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

Of course, that's not to say we shouldn't cost-benefit analysis the implementation; not using straight OpenSSL for this is a wise decision. Hence the suggestion of using the existing and tested Tor support to encrypt by default.
