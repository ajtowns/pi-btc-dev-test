And again, you dodge the question...

It's not that I don't remember, it's that for all your "reasons" I can
always say one of these:

1) This could only be an indirect consequence of rising fees (people will
move to a competitive system, cheap transactions will become unreliable,
etc).
2) This problem will appear with other sizes too and it needs to be solved
permanently no matter what (dumb mempool design, true scalability, etc)

Whatever, even suggesting you may want to just spread fud and that's why
you don't respond directly to the questions made you respond directly to
the question: you answered with "[]".
I just give up trying that people worried about a non-increase in the short
term answer to me that question. I will internally think that they just
want to spread fud, but not vey vocal about it.
It's just seems strange to me that you don't want to prove to me that's not
the case when it is so easy to do so: just answer the d@#/&m question.

I'm not so sure, people keep talking about the need to scale the system by
increasing the consensus maximum...
But I'm happy that, indeed, many (possibly most?) people understand this.

I disagree with this.
In any case, how can future demand be easier to predict than software
development times?
