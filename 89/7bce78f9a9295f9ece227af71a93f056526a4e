Yes.

Not so? but what you're actually seeing is that difficult change is
relative to the prior block's difficulty. E.g. if the penultimate
block in the difficulty cycle is under the special rule the difficulty
change will be relative to 1.

(I had intentionally avoided triggering that test case when adding the
timewarp attack to the testnet chain in case we had wanted to fix it
prior to testnet3's release? I guess I should have added it sooner in
order to catch the bitcoinj misbehavior!)
