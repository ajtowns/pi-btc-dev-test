This is a reminder that many languages still require translation coverage.
 See this page to see the percentage of strings translated into a given
language.  The 0.9.2 release candidate is currently scheduled for May 13th
with translations accepted for the release for at least a week after that.

Even if you do not speak other languages, you can help by pointing other
people who do at this page.
