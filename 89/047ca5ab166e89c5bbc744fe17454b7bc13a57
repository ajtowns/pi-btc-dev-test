Yes; I know that.  I'm saying that it would make it easier for SPV (and other 
lightweight clients) for that matter.

I don't think that's thinking big enough.  What I imagine is that making it 
easier and easier to store a partial blockchain would result in lower demand 
on full nodes.

I might run a client that has only fetched blocks that contain transactions 
needed to verify my balances, right back to the genesis block.  That will be 
some small subset of the block chain and will take me very little resource to 
maintain.  I join the network and am my client is willing to verify based on 
information I have, or supply (by REST or bitcoin protocol) blocks.  Imagine 
then that everyone with a wallet were doing this.  The blockchain would be 
distributed massively.  Obviously the miners would still be keeping the entire 
chain, but we'd have a lot more nodes in the network, each contributing a 
little bit and so reducing the load on the full nodes.

Almost; because you can go and ask someone else the same question, it's pretty 
easy to check if you're being lied to.  Also, it's far easier to maintain a 
headers-only block chain.  When you fetch your relevant block subset, you can 
easily see that they are real blocks in your headers-only blockchain; and so 
it's pretty much impossible to lie to "give me the block containing 
transaction X".
