I think there is nothing wrong with having a numeric memo field, which
is effectively what this is.  Structured rather than unstructured
data.

For example, Amazon will indicate that you're getting x% off by shopping at amazon, but all that number really means is x% off MSRP. In reality, every website has the same price. I have no doubt that merchants would put similarly meaningless and/or misleading data in this field.
