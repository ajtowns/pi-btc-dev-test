Ideally yes, but it will take some time to make a new signature system.
I could also propose a URI scheme that will work with a future implementation but be compatible with the current one explaining its limitations (ex: sigversion=1 to use the current system, default value is sigversion=2 which won't work until a new system is developped).

Ok,thx for your answer, I actually agree with you up until the last sentence. (if not I wouldn't propose this URI scheme :-)
