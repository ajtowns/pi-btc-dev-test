Hi,

Sorry the late response. Going back to the original message:

I am not completely sure what you mean by 'account' and 'mutisig activity'.
You seem to imply
that the same set of extended public keys will be used in more that one
wallet, which it is
not required (and certainly not recommended) by BIP45.

According to BIP45, a singing party, in order to generate a wallet address,
needs the extended public keys of all the other parties, so each party will
be able to see the transaction history of the wallet they are sharing, but
if the party has other wallets with other copayers the xpub should be
completely different.
