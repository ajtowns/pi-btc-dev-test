The next logical step may be for us to offer a public instance of these graphs; I'd be happy to work with you to set one up.

I agree that it would be awesome to offer these types of stats with the installer; unfortunately the route I've taken has dependencies on several other other pieces of software to do all the heavy lifting of stats aggregation and chart rendering. I'm assuming that you would not want to build any of that processing into Bitcoin Core itself; would you be opposed to packaging other software along with the installer?
