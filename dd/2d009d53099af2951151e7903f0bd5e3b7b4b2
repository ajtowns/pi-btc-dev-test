I see your point, but gmaxwell accurately guesses below that when I'm
talking about inflation, I'm including the inflation of the alt too.
With tree-chains that's particularly obvious as the scheme doesn't try
to privilege one chain over another beyond parent-child relationships.


Incidentally, I understand that the pegged chains are meant to be
merge-mined. To me this seems problematic and cheap to attack. Consider
a merge-mined zerocoin sidechain: Can you profit from depositing some
coins, taking them out again, then reorging the zerocoin chain to undo
that withdrawl on the zerocoin side, and performing it all over again?
It'd be easy to drain the pegging pool that way, and with merge-mining
there's no inherent cost to you to do so. Not unique to zerocoin either
of course, just in that case who actually double-spent is unknowable.

Well I'll certainly raid 2-way pegging for ideas. :) I think the big
difference between the two is how I'd like to see tree-chains reduce
dependence on miner validation - ideally miners wouldn't validate at all
if the efficiency can be regained with ZK-SNARKS or something. Dropping
validation from mining could also avoid the problem of how in Bitcoin
there is no explicit mechanism that actually forces miners to validate
the chain. Not unlike gmaxwell's "firedrill" ideas, you would be able to
"firedrill" clients at any point by just mining some invalid garage.

(not to say miners would certainly not do validation - you still want to
be able to pay them transaction fees, but in that case they're doing the
validation only for themselves)

Yup, and in the tree-chains model, every single chain is, from that
perspective, an altcoin.
