Rather than re-enable OP_LEFT, a NOP could be re-purposed in a soft fork.

OP_DUP OP_HASH160 [pubKeyHash[:LEN_PARAM]] [LEN_PARAM] OP_LEFTEQUALVERIFY
OP_DROP OP_CHECKSIG

A B L OP_LEFTEQUALVERIFY checks if the leftmost L bytes of A and B match.
If not, then the script immediately fails.  If either array is less than L
bytes or if there are fewer than 3 values on the stack, then it also fails.

The OP_DROP is needed as the new opcode must count as a NOP for legacy
nodes.

A change like this would only cause a once-off improvement in efficiency,
so it is less likely to be worth the effort.

It also requires most clients to be updated to support the new address
system.

A different BIP could be added for that.

An alternative way to add new opcodes is to use a different script engine
like with P2SH.
