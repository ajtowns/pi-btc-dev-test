To be clear, full-RBF is a change that broadens what the P2P network
relays - transactions previously not relayed are now relayed. Under no
circumstance will full-RBF result in transactions *not* being relayed
that previously were relayed. This makes the P2P network more useful
rather than less, as it gives a predictable and uniform method to get
transactions to a wider variety of miners with a wider variety of
policies.

Note how even if no miners ever supported full-RBF, supporting full-RBF
on relay nodes would still be useful to users as it provides an easy and
cost-effective mechanism to rebroadcast transactions. In fact,
supporting full-RBF by default and disabling it if getblocktemplate is
called would be reasonable, if more than a bit of a hack!

In any case, my pull-req lets you set -fullrbfactivationtime=0 as a
simple and easy way to disable full-RBF functionality. Miners and relay
nodes who choose not to support it can easily do so, similar to how
OP_RETURN transactions can be disabled with -datacarrier=0
