I think it's not a horrible idea to just add a field into the transaction
metadata for N_SIG_OPS in the script_sig

It is much simpler in implementation if the concern is complexity (once a
transaction goes above N_SIG_OPS it could be considered invalid, number
computed must be equal). It wouldn't even need to be stored permanently as
it can be pruned easily and recomputed later (hashes would protect against
buggy complicated sig counting code).

Furthermore, it would differentiate a branch with different counts well.
