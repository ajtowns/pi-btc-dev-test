I've noticed this same behavior with 0.5 release candidates.  I remember
seeing it with 0.4 also, so I think it's not a regression.  I haven't yet
pinned down the cause.  It would be nice to fix; especially for those
downloading the blockchain for the first time.

 Also, where can I find the number of connections using new Bitcoin-QT?

Hover over the signal icon in the lower right corner.  The icon looks like
a cellphone signal indicator.  The number of connections is displayed in a
tooltip.
