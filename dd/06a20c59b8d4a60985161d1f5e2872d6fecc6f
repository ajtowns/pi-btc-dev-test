Subject: [bitcoin-dev] "Subsidy fraud" ?
Message-ID: <2770009.yIOdKLpzfC@1337h4x0r>

Pieter Wuille mentions "subsidy fraud" in his recent talk:

I was unable to google what this is, and the Bitcoin Wiki also does not seem 
to explain it.

If this is a well-known problem, perhaps it would be a good idea to explain it 
somewhere?
