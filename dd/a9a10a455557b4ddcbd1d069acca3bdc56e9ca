Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal: Disable digests on bitcoin-dev
Message-ID: <CAEz79PoGiQc7yJckwEacNtEP_OSMUr3+yyHQTM0UgKBuRzFhfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I think we should agree to disable the ability to subscribe with digests on
bitcoin-dev list.  I think digests were from an earlier era of Internet
history.  Digests are inconvenient for everyone because replies have the
problem of breaking threads.    These days people should be setting mail
filters to separate list mail from other mail.  I think digests are really
not a net-positive for the community so we should just turn off the ability
to do it.

Any objections?
