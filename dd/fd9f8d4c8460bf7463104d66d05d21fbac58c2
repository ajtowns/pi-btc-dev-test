Great post, Peter.

4) By fixing the problem (or possibly just "fixing" the problem) are
we encouraging/legitimising blockchain use-cases other than BTC value
transfer? Should we?

I don't think it would encourage non-value-transfer usage more
because, as you noted, many such use cases are valuable enough that
people are willing to pay much higher transaction fees in order to
have their data timestamped. I think it's more an issue of the block
space / transaction fee market since the cost of making a transaction
is directly borne by users, as opposed to the cost of the UTXO set
which may not be borne by them if they don't run a full node.

I'm of the opinion that if the world decides that Bitcoin is more
valuable as a trustworthy generalized timestamping mechanism than as a
value transfer system, protocol developers shouldn't try to steer the
ship against the wind. As more people and use cases enter the
ecosystem, the most valuable ones ought to survive - I hope that this
market will be fostered by the developers.
