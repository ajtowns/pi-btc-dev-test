Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Can this tx be formed?
Message-ID: <CABOyFfqKJx2RJ+urZoO2zbdQ1YNXOvA=b9HQZ4j2R-ETTR0Tbg@mail.gmail.com>

Say Alice signs and broadcasts a tx with input Ai, with SIGHASH_SINGLE
to Ao and SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY
Bob signs and broadcasts a tx with input Bi, with SIGHASH_SINGLE to Bo
and SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY

Can Carol complete the tx so that it is valid to be published in the chain?
It only has to make Ai + Bi + Ci + F = Ao + Bo + Co
but it all must be contained in a single transaction.
