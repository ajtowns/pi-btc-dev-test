When flushwallet is disabled, the wallet is not flushed (written to
disk in a self-contained state) periodically. This means that there's
a larger chance that the wallet database is in inconsistent state when
the process stops unexpectedly. This can happen either due to a crash,
or an external cause such as the power turning off unexpectedly.

With the wallet in non-self-contained state, the next time that you
start bitcoind BerkeleyDB will have to process log files. There is a
non-zero chance that this will fail and manual recovery is needed.

As the wallet is usually critical, it is unwise to disable that option.
