Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Sign / Verify message against SegWit P2SH addresses.
Message-ID: <CAAUFj10gEPBS3nTZ6aJn4UazhcJKPni6_pYGWwOs+QNeDo9NaA@mail.gmail.com>

I know there are posts, and an issue opened against it, but is there anyone
writing a BIP for Sign / Verify message against a SegWit address?

I realize it is not a feature in wide use, but I think it still serves an
important purpose, such as when proof of assets are requested.
