On further reflection, I'm not sure I understand this use case of the
payment protocol.  Since a PaymentRequest currently contains the
Outputs that specify the addresses to send to, reusing a
PaymentRequest like this without using stealth addresses implies
address reuse.

(Granted there are alternative solutions to stealth addresses, such as
a BIP32-style derivation.)
