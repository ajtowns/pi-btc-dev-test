I see the huge amount of sweat and love that went into core and it actually hurts to see that most is expended in friction and lack of a vision for the software architecture.

To be concrete, this was my plan if dealing with the Core code base:

1) I'd consider the separation of networking and storage as suggested for a future extended libconsensus low priority, as their design should be (are) dominated by the need of the consensus logic only.

2) create an API to the consensus+networking+storage service that is not at the C++ language level but some scaleable cross-platform remoting, like eg. ZeroMQ.
This API should be minimal and simple, assuming that one fully trusts the node answering it. This API would unlock user land development by distinct teams with diverse technologies.

3) move the wallet, QT and RPC and other backward compatibility stuff (if e.g. there is some mining support) in-top of the new API and into distinct source code repositories.

I got quickly frustrated when I was only able to get through very few things (i.e. moving core structure serialization classes to a separate unit not called main). Working on Bitcoin has an added layer of frustration that goes beyond most open source projects: even though we're clearly in userland working at the application layer, a good layered protocol design is still lacking. We have no standards process separate from what basically amount to updates to one specific reference implementation. And we all need to agree on any major change, since a blockchain that is easily forked in contentious ways pretty much defeats its own purpose.

Several people have poured themselves passionately into the reference codebase, most of whom did it (at least initially) purely as unpaid volunteers. There's a lot of love that's gone into this. But it's become pretty clear that the modularization is no longer merely a matter of good engineering - it is essential to resolving serious political challenges.

It's too easy to let ego and habit dictate one's preferences rather than rational engineering considerations.

Specifically, we need a consensus layer that doesn't try to specify networking, storage, wallets, UI, etc. Let different people improve upon these things independently in their own implementations. What matters is that we all converge on a common history and state. At the same time, let's open up more competition on all these other things that are separate from the consensus layer.
