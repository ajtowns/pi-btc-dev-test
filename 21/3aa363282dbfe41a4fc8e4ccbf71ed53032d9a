This isn?t necessarily true. Every miner has its own mining policy. If they choose to delay including transactions proportional to their fee + first seen, then you create a time based fee market. Want quick confirmation? Pay a high fee. Don?t care that much? Pay a low fee (and anywhere in between). This market would work just fine even if block capacity was unbounded.
