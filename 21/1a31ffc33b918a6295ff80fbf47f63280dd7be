Since it seems unlikely that we'll be able to ship an integrated stats / monitoring feature in the short term, I went ahead and set up a public Statoshi instance and threw a nicer interface on top of it.

http://statoshi.info

You can also view the raw Graphite stats at http://statoshi.info:8080/

If there are any metrics that you think would be helpful for development or monitoring purposes, just let me know and I'll take a shot at adding them.
