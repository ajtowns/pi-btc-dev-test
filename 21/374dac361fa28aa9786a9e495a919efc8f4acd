I understand that you are in favor of a "guided decentralization" and you are most happily invited to follow this path. I don't want to be on it. I want total decentralisation of bitcoin and many other parts of the current system.

I specifically asked you to stop misrepresenting - I?m NOT in favor of guided decentralization, I never said anything like that. *THIS* is the problem?you?re reading intentions into others that simply are NOT there. If you don?t really understand something, ask.

I want complete decentralization - but for practical reasons, which should be obvious, we cannot start at this point. Bitcoin came into existence because Satoshi wrote a whitepaper and implemented the idea - and it was his rules. There was no voting, no committee, no proof-of-work, no nothing?it was a complete dictatorship in the beginning.

Interestingly enough in the end we will probably have a winner - determined by the price - so I am looking forward to the outcome. It is just the time so make some bets, which I embrace.

Bitcoin is not going to vanish or break from this. It is just forking. One fork will come stronger out of this. You just have to choose a side and live with it, if you loose it all. But that is the story of bitcoin since the beginning. If you ask me, you fear the choice, not the change.

Again, misrepresentation - ?you fear the choice, not the change? - why should anyone ask *you* what I fear? Why don?t you ask *me*?

For better or worse, it is *very hard* to change the rules?and this is exactly what imbues Bitcoin with one of its most powerful attributes: very well-defined settlement guarantees that cannot be suddenly altered nor reversed by anyone.

If even fairly uncontroversial soft forks have caused problems, can you imagine the kinds of potential problems that a hard fork over some highly polarizing issue might raise? Do you really think people are going to want to cooperate?!?
> >

Other people might want feature X, others feature Y?and we can argue the merits of this or that to death?but the fact remains that we have NEVER attempted any hard forking change?not even with a simple, totally uncontroversial no-brainer improvement that would not risk any sort of ill-will that could hamper remedies were it not to go as smoothly as we like. *THIS* is the fundamental problem - the whole bigger block thing is a minor issue by comparison?it could be any controversial change, really.

This is what attempting a hard fork mechanism that?s NEVER been done before in such a politically divisive environment basically amounts to?but it?s even worse. We?re basically risking the entire air force (not just one plane) over an argument regarding how many seats a plane should have that we?ve never flown before.
> >

Don?t we owe it to them to at least test out the system on a far less controversial, far less divisive change first to make sure we can even deploy it without things breaking? I don?t even care about the merits regarding bigger blocks vs. smaller blocks at this point, to be quite honest - that?s such a petty thing compared to what I?m talking about here. If we attempt a novel hard-forking mechanism that?s NEVER been attempted before (and which as many have pointed out is potentially fraught with serious problems) on such a politically divisive, polarizing issue, the result is each side will refuse to cooperate with the other out of spite?and can easily lead to a war, tanking the value of everyone?s assets on both chains. All so we can process 8 times the number of transactions we currently do? Even if it were 100 times, we wouldn?t even come close to touching big payment processors like Visa. It?s hard to imagine a protocol improvement that?s worth the risk.
> >

And different people obviously have different priorities and preferences as to which of these changes would be best to do first. This whole XT thing is essentially giving *one* proposal special treatment above those that others have proposed. Many of us have only held back from doing this out of our belief that goodwill amongst network participants is more important than trying to push some pet feature some of us want.
