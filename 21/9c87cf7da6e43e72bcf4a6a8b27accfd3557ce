I'll go further: whatever people have commented here and elsewhere about
this feature (myself included) are personal opinions on the feature itself,
in the hope you take the concerns into account.

These comments are not a judgement on whether this should be accepted as a
BIP. Specifically, the BIP editor should accept a BIP even if he personally
dislikes the ideas in it, when the criteria are satisfied.

Beyond that, having a BIP accepted does not mean wallets have to implement
it. That's up to the individual wallet authors/maintainers.
