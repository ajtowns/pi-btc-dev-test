I'd argue that at the point where there's consistently more transactions 
than the network can handle, there are two significant risks. Firstly, 
that people don't care enough to pay the transaction fees required to 
get their transaction prioritised over another's, and secondly that as 
transactions start outright failing (which will happen with enough 
transactions backlogged) the network is considered unreliable, the 
currency illiquid, and there's a virtual "bank rush" to get into a more 
usable currency.

I understand the desire to use current demand to model future, however I 
feel there's a lack of understanding of just how inadequate the main 
chain is as a global clearance network. My go-to example for this is 
CHIPS (US-only, inter-bank only clearance) which already handles 
slightly over 3 transactions per second on average across a year 
(https://www.theclearinghouse.org/~/media/tch/pay%20co/chips/reports%20and%20guides/chips%20volume%20through%20may%202015.pdf?la=en). 
If Bitcoin is to be used across a wider portion of the world's 
population, and/or beyond clearance between financial institutions, it 
needs larger blocks. This is not about handling the several orders of 
magnitude more transactions that would be required to replace credit 
cards or cash, but simply to enabling other technologies to perform that 
scaling.

Also, and I'm aware most on this list do understand the situation better 
than this, I find it immensely frustrating to see people suggesting that 
Greece or other large groups should adopt Bitcoin, while there's clearly 
inadequate support (on chain or off) to do so.
