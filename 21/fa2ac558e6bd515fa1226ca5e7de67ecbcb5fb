I've spend some time looking at the Datacoin code, and I've come to the 
conclusion the next copycatcoin I release will have an explicit 'data' 
field with something like 169 bytes (a bakers dozen squared), which will 
add 1 byte to each transaction if unused, and provide a small, but usable
data field for proof of publication. As a new coin, I can also do a
hardfork that increases the data size limit much easier if there is a
compelling reason to make it bigger.

I think this will prove to be a much more reliable infrastructure for 
proof of publication than various hacks to overcome 40 byte limits with
Bitcoin.

I am disclosing this here so the bitcoin 1% has plenty of time to evaluate
the market risk they face from the 40 byte limit, and put some pressure to
implement some of the alternatives Todd proposes.
