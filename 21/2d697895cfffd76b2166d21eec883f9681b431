My vision is a strong _decentralized_ system, which is:

  a) too important to close,

  b) able to provide adequate response to governments, like EFF or Google do.

Having a substantial attack surface and, at the same time, not having significant power is the worst fighting strategy.

It's the "Peter Todd vs 10 cops" scenario.


>The inability to see another option is the inability to understand what Satoshi created.

So your closing remark is basically, "you're too stupid to understand"?

I'll take it.
