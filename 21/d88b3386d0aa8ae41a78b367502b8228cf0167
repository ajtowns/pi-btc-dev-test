Thanks Mark.
Ok next obvious question (apologies for all of these but it seems you are
the authority on Lightning here). Is the Lightning system limited in the
number of hops there can be in the payment channel? I am looking at the
initial Lightning slides presented in February and it looks like the
locktime decrements by 1-day along each hop. So the more hops there are the
longer my bitcoins are potentially locked up for?
