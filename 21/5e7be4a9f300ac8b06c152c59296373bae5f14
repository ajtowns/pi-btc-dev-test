It would be a privacy leak to request only the specific timestamps, but I 
suppose many wallets lack even basic privacy to begin with.

To address the bounds issue, I have specified that when from/to don't have an 
exact record, that the previous/next (respectively) is provided.

Hopefully this addresses both concerns?

That's what the "timedelta" field solves, no?
If you want one value per day, you'd put 86400.

Is it not sufficient for the server to specify this in the description of the 
given currency-pair feed?
