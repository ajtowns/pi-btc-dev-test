So, because the [mnemonic]->[bip32 root] is just hashing, you've
effectively made your "mnemonic sentence" into a brainwallet? Since every
mnemonic sentence can now lead to a bip32 root, and only the client that
created the mnemonic can verify the mnemonic passes its checksum (assuming
all clients use different wordlists, the only client that can help you if
you fat-finger the sentence is the client that created it)?
