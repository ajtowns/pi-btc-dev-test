No, even if bitcoin crashes to 1 usd you don't need to change back to
BTC, you can keep the existing-accounting-tools friendly micro. That's
the whole point, having "one true only unit change". You would only
need to change it if there was a sub-satoshi hardfork, which doesn't
seem necessary anytime soon.

We shouldn't make any assumptions about the future price of bitcoin to
make the decision.

This sounds very US-centric to me. Aren't you thinking in usd?

It won't look like an expensive holiday to, say, someone used to Viet
Nam Dong (VND), Uzbekistani Som (UZS) or Mongolian Tugrik (MNT).

"People seem to like mBTC" is just an ad populum fallacy: millions of
flies can actually be wrong. Also you haven't showed them micros,
maybe they like it too.

So the only valid argument I've heard in favor of mBTC so far is "some
wallets/services are doing it wrong already".
