The argument that optional fields can be omitted is not applicable to 
required fields, you are correct. That should be rather obvious because 
required fields are not optional fields.

Probably a tiny bit more complex as the current format assumes a lot more.

You may have misread my email because there was no argument made towards 
complexity. The argument was towards flexibility.

Please consider that I'm not going to search for something based on a vague 
reference like that, if you want to convince me you could you at least 
provide a URL?
You want me to see the value of your idea, I think you should at least 
provide the argument. Isn't that fair?

Thanks for your email Peter, would love you to put a bit more time into 
understanding flexible transactions and we can have a proper discussion 
about it.
