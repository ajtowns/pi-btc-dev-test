Companies can have a Cert with their name via CAcert. It requires some work though to get assured as an organisation.
Did you already think about what CA is to be trusted or do users need to do that. The least good decision in my POV would be to accept OS/browser built in CAs only.

In the companies register and therefore certificate it's something like "Singh Food GmbH". That's probably good enough to prevent shenanigans. Even if there's a virus on your phone, it can't really replace the cert with a random stolen one, otherwise your meal could show up like "IronCore Steel Inc" or something that's obviously bogus. It'd have to be an incredibly smart virus that knew how to substitute one name for a different one, from a large library of stolen identities, such that the swap seemed plausible. That sounds very hard, certainly too hard to bother with for stealing restaurant fees.

But eventually the corrupt waiter will be discovered and then someone will have proof of what they did. It's FAR more likely they'd just strip the signature entirely and try to convince you the restaurant doesn't use BIP70 at all.

That is, if you say you want a cert for "Shamrock Irish Pub, Wollishofen, Zurich, CH" then it either sends a postcard to that address with a code to check ownership of the address, or it checks ownership of the place on Google Maps (which does the same postcard trick but for free!).
