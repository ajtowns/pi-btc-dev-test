Hi Juan


  >  I tend to believe more in Moore?s law, Butters' Law of Photonics and Kryder?s Law all has been verified for many years and support that 32 MB in 2020 are possible and equals or less than 1 MB in 2010.



  Protocol development, especially one in control of people's money cannot be based on beliefs. Do you have actual data to show significant increases in desktop CPU, memory and bandwidth?


All empirical evidence points to the opposite.

Intel has been struggling to eek out 5-10% gains for each generation of its CPUs. The growth of the total blockchain size at 1MB alone is much faster than this.

CPU Core counts have also been stagnant for a decade.

Disk Space growth has also been slowing and with the trend towards SSDs, available disk space in a typical PC has turned negative sharply.

Luv

Alphonse,



Even when several of the experts involved in the document you refer has my respect and admiration, I do not agree with some of their conclusions some of their estimations are not accurate other changed like Bootstrap Time, Cost per Confirmed Transaction they consider a network of 450,000,00 GH and today is 3.594.236.966 GH, the energy consumption per GH is old, the cost of electricity is wrong even when the document was made and is hard to find any parameter used that is valid for an analysis today.



Again with all respect to the experts involved in that analysis is not valid today.



I tend to believe more in Moore?s law, Butters' Law of Photonics and Kryder?s Law all has been verified for many years and support that 32 MB in 2020 are possible and equals or less than 1 MB in 2010.



Again may be is not possible Johnson Lau and LukeJr invested a significant amount of time investigating ways to do a safe HF, and may be not possible to do a safe HF today but from processing power, bandwidth and storage is totally valid and Wang Chung proposal has solid grounds.



Regards



Juan

Juan,



I suggest you take a look at this paper: http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf  It may help you form opinions based in science rather than what appears to be nothing more than a hunch.  It shows that even 4MB is unsafe.  SegWit provides up to this limit.

8MB is most definitely not safe today.



Whether it is unsafe or impossible is the topic, since Wang Chun proposed making the block size limit 32MiB.





Wang Chun,

Can you specify what meeting you are talking about?  You seem to have not replied on that point.  Who were the participants and what was the purpose of this meeting?

Alphonse,



In my opinion if 1MB limit was ok in 2010, 8MB limit is ok on 2016 and 32MB limit valid in next halving, from network, storage and CPU perspective or 1MB was too high in 2010 what is possible or 1MB is to low today.



If is unsafe or impossible to raise the blocksize is a different topic.

Juan

What meeting are you referring to?  Who were the participants?



Removing the limit but relying on the p2p protocol is not really a true 32MiB limit, but a limit of whatever transport methods provide.  This can lead to differing consensus if alternative layers for relaying are used.  What you seem to be asking for is an unbound block size (or at least determined by whatever miners produce).  This has the possibility (and even likelihood) of removing many participants from the network, including many small miners.



32MB in less than 3 years also appears to be far beyond limits of safety which are known to exist far sooner, and we cannot expect hardware and networking layers to improve by those amounts in that time.



It also seems like it would be much better to wait until SegWit activates in order to truly measure the effects on the network from this increased capacity before committing to any additional increases.

I've proposed this hard fork approach last year in Hong Kong Consensus
but immediately rejected by coredevs at that meeting, after more than
one year it seems that lots of people haven't heard of it. So I would
post this here again for comment.

The basic idea is, as many of us agree, hard fork is risky and should
be well prepared. We need a long time to deploy it.

Despite spam tx on the network, the block capacity is approaching its
limit, and we must think ahead. Shall we code a patch right now, to
remove the block size limit of 1MB, but not activate it until far in
the future. I would propose to remove the 1MB limit at the next block
halving in spring 2020, only limit the block size to 32MiB which is
the maximum size the current p2p protocol allows. This patch must be
in the immediate next release of Bitcoin Core.

With this patch in core's next release, Bitcoin works just as before,
no fork will ever occur, until spring 2020. But everyone knows there
will be a fork scheduled. Third party services, libraries, wallets and
exchanges will have enough time to prepare for it over the next three
years.

We don't yet have an agreement on how to increase the block size
limit. There have been many proposals over the past years, like
BIP100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 148, 248, BU, and so
on. These hard fork proposals, with this patch already in Core's
release, they all become soft fork. We'll have enough time to discuss
all these proposals and decide which one to go. Take an example, if we
choose to fork to only 2MB, since 32MiB already scheduled, reduce it
from 32MiB to 2MB will be a soft fork.

Anyway, we must code something right now, before it becomes too late.
