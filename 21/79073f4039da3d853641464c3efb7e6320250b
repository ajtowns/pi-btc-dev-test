Do it. Someone will scream harm. The loudest voices screaming how it would
be harmful are doing the most harm.

The only way to know is build it, and test it. If the network breaks, then
it is better we find out sooner rather than later.

My only suggestion is call it 'bitstake' or something to clearly differentiate
it from Bitcoin. This also might be an interesting application of the side
chains concept Peter Todd has discussed.

I would like to create a Bitcoin branch that provides a sandboxed testbed for researching the best PoS implementations. In the years to come, perhaps circumstances might arise, such as shifting of user opinion as to whether PoS should be moved from the prohibited list to the hard-fork list.
