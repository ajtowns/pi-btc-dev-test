You have to specify what you mean by "PoS" - there's dozens of variations.
Equally, existing pure PoS schemes probably don't make sense as a "bolt-on"
add-on, as once you introduce PoW to it you should design something that uses
the capabilities of both systems.

FWIW, I've heard that the Ethereum guys are leaning towards abandoning pure PoS
and are now trying to design a PoW + staking system instead.

To be clear, you mean such a scheme would protect the multi-billion dollar
investments non-malicious miners have made in SHA256^2 hardware by ensuring it
remains useful, right?

Note that if those PoS blocks are *pure* PoS, you'll create a significant risk
of double-spend attacks, as there's zero inherent cost to creating a pure-PoS
block. Such blocks can't be relied on for confirmations; even "slasher" schemes
have significant problems with sybil attacks.

The scaling problem is one of scalability; PoS does nothing to improve
scalability (though many in the ETH community have been making dishonest
statements to the contrary).

As a sidechain yes, but in what you propose above the extra blocks wouldn't
contain transactions that non-PoS-aware nodes could understand in a
backwards-compatible way.


All the above aside, I don't think it's inherently wrong to look at adding PoS
block *approval* mechanisms, where a block isn't considered valid without some
kind of coin owner approval. While pure-PoS is fundamentally broken in a
decentralized setting, it may be possible to mitigate the reasons it's broken
with PoW and get a system that has a stronger security model than PoW alone.

FWIW there's some early discussions by myself and others about this type of
approach on the #bitcoin-wizards IRC channels, IIRC from around 2014 or so.
