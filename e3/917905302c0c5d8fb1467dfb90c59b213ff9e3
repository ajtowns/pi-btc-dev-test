You missed one key point - information transmitted across networks is
not slowed down on a per-bit basis, its (largely) slowed down on a
per-packet basis! You have some 1400+ bytes to work with before you
notice the increase in information in relay cost. Of course this only
applies if you are talking about long-haul links (across oceans, between
countries, etc), if you're talking about short links it is a per-byte
cost, but your time is probably negligible for anything but VERY large
blocks.

Very fast is an understatement. My point was that it is literally always
a single packet, and a very small packet, at that.

I think you missed it, this mail was not about the relay network. Let's
ignore the relay network entirely for now. Several miners have nodes
well distributed all over the globe which peer either directly with
other miners in the area, or just connect to a ton of nodes, probably
hitting other miners. The cost to transmit from their pool server to
their relay server is one packet, always. They pre-relay everything
they're gonna include, so, at max, they might have to pick between a few
pre-relayed blocks (what, like, 2/5 bits?). From there, you assume they
are transmitting to a node in the same DC, or at least very close (say,
local within AWS-US-East/maybe between AWS-US-East and somewhere in
NYC), where transmitting even 100MB is really fast.
