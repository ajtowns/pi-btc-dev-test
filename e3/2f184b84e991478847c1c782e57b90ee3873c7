	higher

To add some information about the relevance of this:

During December 2017 there were roughly 210.000 Omni Layer transactions,
with more than 12.000 transactions on peak days, and the numbers are
growing.

I assume there is a similar number of Counterparty transactions, which
most likely benefit from additional payload space, too.
