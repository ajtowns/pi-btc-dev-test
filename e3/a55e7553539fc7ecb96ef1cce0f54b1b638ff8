Hello,

It is hard for me to come out disagreeing with Maxwell, however in this case I feel I must.

As many may remember, there was quite some controversy about the BIP16 vs BIP 17 split; the main argument for BIP16 was the urgency of P2SH, and how this was the already ?tested and proven to work? solution.

I was one of the man hold-out supporters of BIP17, not for any clear reason (I now have a much better technical understanding of the Bitcoin technical details, as we all do); But because it was the ?more elegant? solution.  I knew from other fields of engineering that elegant solutions very often better deal with the ?unknown, unknowns?.  I also didn?t agree with Gavin?s ?the sky is falling? sense of urgency.

However, of-course the community got behind BIP16, it was activated, fortunately, without any signifiant incident.

I did learn that in Bitcoin there is something more valuable than technical elegance: that is community buy-in. On the technical side, the engineers need to make sure the solutions are viable: however on the community side we need to make sure that the good solutions are adopted in a reasonable timeframe.

It is both my empirical view and heart-felt belief that the wider Bitcoin Community wants SegWit quickly. In this case the sacrifice of some technical elegance and correctness for expediency is prudent!

It is my unfortunate view that Maxwell is missing the political forest for the technical trees.  Not only is SegWit a technical solution to technical problems; it has come to represent, by the larger Bitcoin Community, a political solution to the conflict that we are waist-deep in every, single, day.

BIP 148 is out terms of peace.  The Bitcoin Community is tired-to-death of this war and wants a resolution swiftly. BIP 148 proves a outlet, and in Maxwell words: ?...almost guarantees at a minor level of disruption.?.

I am willing to go through this minor level of disruption, as the daily disruption from the ?scaling debate war?; in my personal online life, is far greater.

SegWit is a exceptional feat of engineering, it solves and mitigates so many small and highly subtle issues within Bitcoin; yet still managed to be simple enough successfully reviewed: now the community is clearly calling for a quick activation of the ?viable? technical choice.

If you/we are going to provide any engineering solution to activating SegWit, then Swiftness should be the 1st priority after viability.

BIP 148 is both Swift and Viable.

Cameron.
