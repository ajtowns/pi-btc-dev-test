Yes, the terminology is creating a lot of confusion. I would be happy to
contribute to a discourse that helps to clear up the ambiguities and
cringeworthiness of current "standardized terminology".
Robert Keagen developed a perspective on psychological development [1] and
it appears to me that Stage 2 and 3 (miner, cash, network upgrade, ...) is
discussing with Stage 4 (hash power, settlement, fork, ...).

"Miner" is not wrong, just not helpful if you try to gauge the deeper
complexities of Bitcoin. Likewise, "money" is not wrong if you explain it
to a child, while credit and debt is much more useful if you want to gauge
the deeper complexities of economics.

still, any form forking has dilutive effect on existing BTC holders.


Not at all, I sleep sound and anticipate any such event as an ugly scrip
dividend.

Regards
Martin
