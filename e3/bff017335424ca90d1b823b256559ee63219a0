I'll interpret the question as "why is the Bitcoin Core software still <1.0.0". Bitcoin the currency doesn't have a version, the block/transaction versions are at v3/v1 respectively, and the highest network protocol version is 70011. 

Mostly because we don't use the numbers as a signaling mechanism. They just count up, every half year.

Otherwise, one'd have to ask hard questions like 'is the software mature enough to be called 1.0.0', which would lead to long arguments, all of which would eventually lead to nothing more than potentially increasing a number. We're horribly stressed-out as is.
