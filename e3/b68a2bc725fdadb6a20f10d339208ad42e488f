I don't think encouraging mining more transactions is a good idea since 
it would promote inefficient transaction patterns. It's more efficient 
to send transactions with a high number of outputs/inputs instead of 
creating long transaction chains as some services do.

You might consider incentivizing miners to mine blocks that reduce the 
UTXO set size the most, or some other metric that promotes efficient 
uses of the blockchain.
