Well I think regularly scheduled IRC meetings are a good idea, as for some
smaller decisions quick brainstorming tends to work better than long e-mail
threads.

But indeed big and important decisions should be posted on the mailing list
too.

Agreed in that we don't need a "number allocation king". But some rules for
the numbering can be good to keep sanity. What about very simply "everyone
that wants to create a BIP picks the next available number and reserves
that page on the Wiki?".

I'm not sure about a full feature freeze. I agree it could be wise not do
any more changes of the scale of ultraprune before 0.9, to give some
stability to fix the kinks in the current version.
