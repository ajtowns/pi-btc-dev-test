Of course: do we apply this rule to all pubkeys passed to
CHECKMULTISIG (my preference...), or just the ones that are otherwise
checked?

This will likely make existing outputs hard to spend as well (I don't
have numbers), are we okay with that? We probably can't make this a
consensus rule, as it may make existing P2SH outputs/addresses
unspendable.
