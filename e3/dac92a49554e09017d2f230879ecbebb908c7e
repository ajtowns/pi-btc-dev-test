No objections from me, I've already looked at the code a few times and did
some testing here and there, looks good for merging.

Yep, that'd be great.

Fully agreed about payment protocol, autotools and Qt5 build.

I'm still not very excited about coin control (and last time I looked at
the code, it has an issue that it introduced statefulness into the wallet
model - a bane for concurrency. But that may be resolved?) . Anyway, many
people seem to want that so it's fine with me, given that the issues are
fixed.
