That makes sense. But it's hard to translate when you just see the same
string twice and don't know the context where it will be used.

No, I just use copy and paste.

Sorry, forgot there was a compiler flag for this. No need to split this
up. As long as there is no explanation or description for each string I
think it's easier to translate whole sentences.

Perfect. This will prevent a lot of confusion. Thanks!
