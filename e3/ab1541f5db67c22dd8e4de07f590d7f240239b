Thank you a lot for doing this test!

Two questions:

1) A node is typically connected to many nodes that would all in parallel
download said block. In your test you measured how fast new blocks that
presumably are being uploaded in parallel to all those other nodes are being
uploaded? Or did you download blocks while those nodes were basically idle?

2) What is your percentage of the very slow connections?

Specifically this is an attempt to prove or disprove the common statement that 1MB blocks were only suitable slower internet connections in 2009 when Bitcoin launched, and that connection speeds have improved to the point of obviously supporting larger blocks.

If the bar for suitability is placed at taking only 1% of the block time (6 seconds) to upload one block to one peer, then 69% of the network fails for 20MB blocks. For comparison, only 10% fail this metric for 1MB blocks.
