For merchant purposes, I believe URI's containing a static pubkeyhash-address
are only a temporary solution until more elaborate solutions that deal with
all concerns appear (tagging transactions, feedback to the merchant, making
the receiver responsible for inclusion, certificates that a payment was
accepted, authentication, ...). I believe static addresses are too limited
for this purpose, and we shouldn't be trying to extend them with too many
features.

There have been discussions about more dynamic approaches (such as HTTP
communication to negotiate an address) here, and I've written my own
proposal as well (https://gist.github.com/1237788). The details are not
really relevant at this time, but these dynamic approaches seem a much
better way of dealing with what you're trying to add to the bitcoin URI
system now.

My 2 cents: keep bitcoin URI's simple for now.
