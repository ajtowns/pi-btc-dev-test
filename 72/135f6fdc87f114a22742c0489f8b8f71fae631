Well let's see.  All else being equal, if everybody uses difficulty to 
buy big blocks during retarget interval 0, blocks and therefore money 
issuance is slower during that interval.  Then, the retargeting causes 
it to be faster during interval 1.  Subsidy got shifted from the 
calendar period corresponding to interval 0, to interval 1.

If you change the reward, you can lower the time-frame of the effect to 
the order of a single block interval, but there is still an effect.

These schemes do not avoid the need for a hard cap, and there are new 
rules for the size of the allowed adjustment, in addition to the main 
rule relating difficulty to block size.  So it seems they generally have 
more complexity than the other blocksize schemes being considered.
