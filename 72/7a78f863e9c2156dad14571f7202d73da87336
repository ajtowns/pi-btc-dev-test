Subject: [bitcoin-dev] push tx fuzzing
Message-ID: <CAGH37S+daPddzwo1bJ0sPs3RfLOE63TPkCrc-X6qhNw7nu6=Xg@mail.gmail.com>

I am interested in finding or writing a fuzzer for push tx APIs. I did not
find one after a brief search. Has anyone found otherwise, or is she in the
process of writing one?

If not, what features would people recommend for a new push tx fuzzer?

Endpoints I would like to test include:

https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/pushtx/

https://insight.bitpay.com/tx/send

https://blockchain.info/pushtx

https://coinb.in/#broadcast

https://btc.blockr.io/tx/push

https://chain.localbitcoins.com/tx/send


The fuzzer should be able to send random data, invalid characters, etc. but
also fuzz particular aspects of the transaction format such as malformed
P2SH and P2PKH transactions, fields such as lock time, size, # inputs,
version number, vin size, etc. It should also be able to fuzz a variety of
valid and invalid script formats using odd op codes, changing the order of
op codes, etc.


If anyone has recommendations about how such a fuzzer should be structured,
please let me know.


Finally, if you are interested in collaborating, please contact me via
private message.


Thanks!

Kristov
