It's not entirely trivial as you have to make sure you're editing on the
0.9 branch not the master branch, but can be done like this:

- Go to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.9.0/doc/release-notes.md
- Click "edit"
- Make your changes and add a commit message describing the change, usually
something like 'doc: Add missing foowidget to release notes'.
