Oh come on. Immediately increasing to 8 MB while miners currently don't
even seem to bother validating blocks?

Or a future where miners are even more centralized than now, which avoids
all problems relay and propagation speed has?

Lightning does not require a hard fork, except that larger blocks would be
very useful for its bulk settlements.

As I have said a dozen times now: sidechains are a mechanism for
experimentation. Maybe through them we will discover technology that allows
better on-chain and/or off-chain scalability, but people moving their coins
to a sidechain has far worse security tradeoffs than just increasing the
Bitcoin blockchain.

Ok, here is a proposal I was working on. I'd like to have had more time,
but I agree a direction/plan are needed to align expectations for the
future:  https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6.

And I think that the reason that so many people care about this suddenly is
because of a fear that somehow the current block size "won't be enough".
Bitcoin has utility at any block size, and perhaps more at some values for
it than others. Talking about "not enough" is acknowledging that we really
believe the block size should scale to demand, while it is the other way
around.
