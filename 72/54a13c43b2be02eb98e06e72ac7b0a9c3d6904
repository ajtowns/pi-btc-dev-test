This is discussion about transactions which are not in the chain yet.

The double spending transaction is not stored? which is, in fact, the
problem which creates these huge chain. When a transaction depending
on the doublespend is received we do not know its parent (because we
dropped it because it was a rule violation) so we keep it around as an
orphan hoping its parent arrives.

The software could maintain a cache of rejected txids to consult for
orphan txn's parents, but it would need to be dropped any time there
is a reorg so I don't know how useful it would be.
