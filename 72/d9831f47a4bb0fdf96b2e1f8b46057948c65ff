Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 151 use of HMAC_SHA512
Message-ID: <87h9cecad5.fsf@rustcorp.com.au>

This seems a weak reason to introduce SHA512 to the mix.  Can we just
make:

K_1 = HMAC_SHA256(key=ecdh_secret|cipher-type,msg="header encryption key")
K_2 = HMAC_SHA256(key=ecdh_secret|cipher-type,msg="body encryption key")

Thanks,
Rusty.
