Matt brought this up on Twitter, I have no idea why I didn't respond weeks
ago (busy writing blog posts, probably):

If block propagation isn't fixed, then mines have a strong incentive to
create smaller blocks.

So the max block size is irrelevant, it won't get hit.

See http://gavinandresen.ninja/are-bigger-blocks-better-for-bigger-miners
for analysis of "but that means bigger miners can get an advantage"
argument.

Executive summary: if little miners are stupid and produce huge blocks,
then yes, big miners have an advantage.

But they're not, so they won't.

Until the block reward goes away, and assuming transaction fees become an
important source of revenue for miners.
I think it is too early to worry about that; see:

Ok. What does this have to do with the max block size?

Are you arguing that work won't happen if the max block size increases?

Again, see http://gavinandresen.ninja/when-the-block-reward-goes-away for
what I think about that.
