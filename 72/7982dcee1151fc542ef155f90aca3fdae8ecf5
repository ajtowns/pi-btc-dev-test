I would take the last block I solved and use it to write a transaction
to nowhere which which gave all 50 BTC out in fee.  This pays for as
many transactions in the block as I like for any value of X you want
to choose.

You should read the bitcointalk forums more often: variants on that
idea are frequently suggested and dismantled. There is a lot of noise
there but also a lot of ideas and knowing what doesn't work is good
too.
