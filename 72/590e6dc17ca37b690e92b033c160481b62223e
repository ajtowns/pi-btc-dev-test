Yeah parallel filtering would be pretty nice. We've implemented a serial
filtering for btcwallet [1] for the use-case of rescanning after a seed
phrase import. Parallel filtering would help here, but also we don't yet
take advantage of batch querying for the filters themselves. This would
speed up the scanning by quite a bit.

I really like the filtering model though, it really simplifies the code,
and we can leverage identical logic for btcd (which has RPCs to fetch the
filters) as well.
