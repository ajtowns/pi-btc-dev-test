I would like to see this specifically for P2SH-PWPKH and/or native SegWit bech32 addresses.

Use cases I can think of are "I'm the whale in charge of these funds, listen to me" and some form of polling.

It's nice if funds aren't excluded from these type of functionalities just because they have a complicated redeem script. So something more generic like the Elements implementation / suggestion Greg Maxwell referred to in the Github thread would be nice too.

Is it also useful or possible to sign a message proving you are able to redeem some arbitrary branch in a MAST-like tree of scripts? What about being a minority part of a multisig?

All these features have privacy trade-offs, as well as perhaps security trade-offs, e.g. when you reveal a public key that was otherwise hidden behind a hash (i.e. if someone were to break secp256k1, they'd first organize a popular poll).

There's no BIP for the current message signing mechanism either afaik.
