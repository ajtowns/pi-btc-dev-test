I saw this problem first hand when Andreas Antonopolis got into a big 
dispute with some of the core developers over the press contacts.  The 
github made up their rules as they went along and simply ignored input 
from anyone outside their inner circle.  Since that time several people 
have told me they dropped out of participating in the github process.  
The maintainers deleted some of my messages and I have been told I am 
banned form github. Further, as you can see on here Jeff Garzik, a guy 
who claims only to hold a few hundred Bitcoin, told people on this list 
to ignore my messages.  There is also the incident where Gavin lambasted 
someone for "hiding behind anonymity" when the whole project is based on 
an anonymous contributor.  I find it interesting that many developers 
who work on a decentralized system.  I don't like the general attitude 
of the developers that they are the protectors of the system and that 
everyone else is trying to exploit or do damage. they often characterize 
different users/businesses/miners as abusers, spammers, people trying to 
game the system, etc. while they characterize the developers as pure and 
good.  When the issue comes up about authority over the code (which 
includes the consensus rules) they spout all kinds of nonsense about how 
they don't have significant control and are not deciders yet they never 
point to who does decide.  If they weren't the deciders then people 
would not be spending all that time lobbying them.  just because there 
are some checks and balances does not mean it is "decentralized" or they 
are not deciders.

As for your proclamation**at Bitcoin core != Bitcoin consensus rules, 
that is simply not true in practice.  There is one piece of software 
with one maintainer.  If you want it changed you have to convince that 
one person to approve the change.

The core developers have the biggest influence by far to decide hard 
fork changes.  There is no other place to go.  While anyone can fork the 
code someone compare it to the river Thames.  if you don't like where 
the river runs you can dig a new one ... here is a spoon.  I can vote in 
elections but that does not mean the US government is "decentralized."  
The core maintainer has decided on a hard fork change, he has decided 
not to do it.

In any case what happened in the past does not matter.  What is going to 
happen now is the question.  If nothing happens and everybody sits 
around saying they are not in charge of the consensus rules and nothing 
ever gets done I see Bitcoin just fading away into oblivion.  I am under 
the impression that at least some of the developers (such as Garzik) 
don't actually hold that many bitcoins and don't have a large stake in 
the system yet they have significant control.  Anyone can attack the 
system by simply hiring a couple core developers and creating the 
gridlock we see now.
