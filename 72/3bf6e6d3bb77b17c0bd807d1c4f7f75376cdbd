Your fault is that you assume the predictions can be reliable and
trustable.

They can not be.

The data you have available has none of the indicators you actually NEED to
make predictions. You're making extrapolations from the past, not
calculations based on recent trends and behavior globally.

It isn't universal. It is just the most practical solution if you need
instant confirmation for high value transactions with customers you don't
yet trust.

Use whatever you want. I don't care. I will warn you about the risks and
make suggestions, but I won't force you to do anything differently.
