No. There are XML-based (shudder) standards for electronic invoicing that
include all sorts of bells and whistles; the PaymentDetails message could
easily encapsulate one of them in an 'invoice' field extension. Or we could
reinvent the wheel and come up with our own, but I'd rather use an existing
standard (or maybe a subset of an existing standard).

I didn't want to wade into that swamp for the 1.0 version of the payment
protocol.

"Two Burgers, one Club Mate" seems pretty user-friendly.

Second, is there a way to communicate acceptance levels of TX

No, because the Payment->PaymentACK communication round-trip is done in
one, non-persistent http request-response round-trip.

I don't think we want to allow merchants to push messages to the wallet
(wouldn't take long for merchants to use the opportunity to push annoying
advertising at me, I think), and I don't think we want wallets to poll the
merchant. Although maybe a payment protocol version 2.0 feature could be a
PaymentACK extension that says "ask me how the transaction is going at THIS
URL in THIS many minutes."
