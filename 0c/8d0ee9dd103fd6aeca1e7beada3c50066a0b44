Tamas,

You could use a key for both signing and for derivation of a deeper 
level (and perhaps there are some applications for this, if you think of 
any please let me know), but the use cases being considered involve 
generation of signing key sequences from seeds that are easy to backup 
and easy to share with others to simplify multidevice synchronization, 
key management, account structures, etc... while also allowing for 
privacy by making it nontrivial to associate transactions for an account 
without knowing the seed/chain code.

As such, we generally refer to such sequences by a path to the immediate 
parent node in the tree and reserve the children themselves for the 
signing keys.


- Eric
