I think John's actually has a point here. If we're judging the quality of a
protocol change by how compatible it is with DNS seeding, then we're clearly not
using DNS seeding as seeding anymore (=getting an entry point into the P2P
network), but as a mechanism for choosing (all) peers.

Eventually, I think it makes sense to move to a system where you get seeds from
a DNS (or other mechanism), connect to one or a few of the results, do a getaddr,
fill your peer IP database with it, and disconnect from the DNS seeded peer.

This probably means we need to look at ways to optimize current peer exchange,
but that's certainly welcome in any case.
