As I mentioned the issue is the potential collision with the block filter,
but bloom filters by themselves aren't inherently bad for privacy. They
just reduce the anonymity set. The reason bip37 doesn't work for privacy is
how the filters have to be used/abused to make it work. That's not what I
mentioned above.

Data for transactions at the tip is only

14kb/s-- potentially less if segwit is in use and you're not getting
witnesses. Is that really that burdensome?


Your not running that on mobile.
