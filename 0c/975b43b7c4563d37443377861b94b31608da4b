I think potential fee subsidies for cleaning up UTXO (and/or penalties 
for creating more UTXO than you burn) are worth thinking about. As 
Gavin's post ( gavinandresen.ninja/utxo-uhoh ) indicates, UTXO cost is 
far higher than block storage, so charging differently for the in/out 
mismatches should make good economic sense.
