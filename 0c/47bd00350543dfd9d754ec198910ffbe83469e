As I alluded to before, certain language lends itself to simple conclusions.
You say that "miner" have simple profit motives and compete only in
their respective domains. But what is "mining"?

It is the process of acquiring a part of the block space. He who
acquires that space can decide over this particular space. (1) Your
entire theory falls apart at the point of an empty block. (2) "The
pursuit of profit can come at the expense of Bitcoin:"
(https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/835233366203072513). (3) Bitcoin
has additional value, like a brand value that could be diverted.
- The market can be gamed for profit. Really.

> So... miners don't really have any authority.

I fall back on Carl Schmitt according to which the sovereign is he who
decides on the state of exception: If there is some person or
institution, in a given polity, capable of bringing about a total
suspension of the law and then to use extra-legal force to normalize
the situation, then that person or institution is the sovereign in
that polity.
- That is spot on, I don't know why the rest of the political theory
shouldn't apply.

> Using miner signalling to determine when/whether SegWit is activated [...]

I didn't think of that, but you are right. The problem is just that it
didn't just give them the impression that they have authority, it
actually transferred the authority.

Again: "The question is simply what legitimate authority a node has."
- You gave legitimacy to their authority! Core did!
(Conversely, the intelligence service of some dictatorship may get
enough hash power to claim authority over the block space, however,
this would have zero legitimacy and could easily be dealt with.)

:(

miner signaling ... just "miner", right?

Thanks for helping me understand.
