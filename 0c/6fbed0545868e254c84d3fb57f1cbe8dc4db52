Yes, you only need a few bits in the version number, probably less than 8.

If you encourage the overt method of using AsicBoost I would argue that you
no longer need to dis-encourage the couvert method anymore as in Greg's
proposal. Nobody would use the couvert method anyway because the overt
method is so much simpler. So maybe the proposals can be completely
disentangled?
