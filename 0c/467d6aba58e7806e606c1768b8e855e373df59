My UX skills are lacking a bit. You can edit all your thoughts about each
BIP, HTML is accepted, so you can link to other posts you made somewhere
else.
When you click on a cell in the grid, it forward you to the page that the
dev edited for this BIP.

This website is not only to say "approve", "disapprove", nor is it about a
formal process for reaching agreement.
This is a tool, a portal, which educates people, and permit you to link all
of your thoughts about the various BIP and show it to others.

With the opinions browse able from the same website, you will notice in a
gleam as soon as one of those proposal reach consensus. (I think SIPA's BIP
has a chance to do so, but nobody knows it yet)
Sadly, the most controversial is a BIP, the noisier it is, at the expense
of those which are not. (like sipa's one).

It irritates me a lot that the debate in public mind is "XT or not" /
"Bigger blocks or not", when in reality there is lots of different
proposals that might also reach consensus but are lost in the noise.
I will add any BIP that at least one voter approve and want to push forward.
I plan to add merchants/wallet providers/mining pools later.
