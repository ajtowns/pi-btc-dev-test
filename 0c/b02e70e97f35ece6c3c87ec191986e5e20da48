Hi!

My fingers have been itching many times now, this debate
drives me nuts.

I just wish all posters could follow two simple principles:

1. Read up. Yes. All of what has been written. Yes, it will
   take many hours. But if you're rehashing what other
   smarter people have said over and over before, you're
   wasting hundreds of peoples time. Please don't.

2. Be helpful. Suggest alternatives. Just cristizising is
   just destructive. If you want no change, then say so.

Mats
