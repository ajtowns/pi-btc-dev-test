Also, MS windows is a very popular operative system.
That's a fallacy:

Wait, wait, is Dogecoin merge-mineable with litecoin?
It could be if its developers wanted to, but I highly doubt it.
Precisely because of the myths spread against merged mining.

You shouldn't make such assumptions about the interests of a potential attacker.
For example, even being of the "cryptocurrency ecosystem" I could
consider that their slogans and videos are confusing newcomers and
they're really harming the general image of p2p currencies by
associating them with mad speculation and pump and dump schemes.

Being heavily involved in this "ecosystem", I would be very happy if
dogecoin disappeared tomorrow. Personally I've never mined anything,
but if I had the resources I would actually consider such an attack.

Again, I think we're getting off-topic with perrocoin. It hardly has
anything to do with MM.
