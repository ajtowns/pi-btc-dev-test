I agree. Every full node operator should (and likely would at some
point) simply never connect to, or relay the address of, any "peer"
advertising itself as diminished. Why on earth would a full node
operator want to encourage shrinking support for bootstrapping and
deep reorgs, resulting in greater load for himself. That's a race to
the bottom.

We are literally talking about $7.50 for the *entire chain* with
breathing room. If someone wants to save a few dollars they are better
off attempting to hide their pruning.
