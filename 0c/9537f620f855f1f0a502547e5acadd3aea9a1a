Cut and paste bug in the last check:

// Null bytes at the start of R are not allowed, unless it would otherwise be
// interpreted as a negative number.
    if (lenS > 1 && (sig[lenR + 6] == 0x00) && !(sig[lenR + 7] & 0x80))
    return false;

You mean "null bytes at the start of S".

Cheers,
Rusty.
