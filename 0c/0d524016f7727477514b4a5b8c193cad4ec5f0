Yes, thank you. I guess that's what everybody is doing to measure
validation performance.
So I guess the timedtest mode doesn't make much sense, at most only as
the blocktime parameter defaulting to zero. If bool
MineBlocksOnDemand() gets refactored out of ChainParams into a
parameter (maybe just use genproclimit ?), you can have the periodic
block generation and the generation on demand reusing the same regtest
mode.

So it seems a new mode only makes sense if the -private mode makes
sense, which in turn only makes sense to include in bitcoind if it's
useful enough for the network attack simulations, which remains the
open question.
