Done: https://github.com/petertodd/bips/

GitHub supports MediaWiki these days, so just directly copying from
'View Source' in the bitcoin.it wiki worked pretty well; I archived the
exact text of BIP. Tables, images and math is all supported by github
and look fine, although github doesn't seem to support coloration in
tables. Users wishing to edit their pull-req's or create new ones can do
so easily by forking the repository - they can see their changes as they
go in GitHub.

I've probably missed some stuff re: formatting, and I haven't changed
any of the submission guideline text in bip 1 yet, but that's probably
90% of the work done.
