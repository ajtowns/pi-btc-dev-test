The files changed tab definitely works better for reading. In the past
comments I put there have disappeared, but I think that can also be true of
comments put on the individual commit reviews (which is another issue with
github, but it's unrelated to how the commits are presented). So I have
lost trust in doing reviews that way. It does make things easier to read
though.

One advantage of using github is that they're an independent third
