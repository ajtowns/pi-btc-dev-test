Although consumer to merchant is a use case for BLE I would argue that NFC has a higher chance of providing a better user experience in most cases since, at least on Android, a user can tap their phone without even having a wallet running. The URI handler will launch the wallet for them. However a dedicated, user facing, screen can give certainty that the user is connecting to the correct recipient. 

1. Because it can show an address prefix 
2. It can display the users nickname/handle upon connecting which is only sent to the merchant upon a point to point connection. Not a broadcast. 

The Airbitz wallet already does this on the recipient side. A popup shows the most recent person connecting to the recipient.

For peer-to-peer payments, how common do we think that the payment is
of an ad hoc nature rather than to a known contact?

If I want to pay my friends/colleagues/etc over a restaurant table
there's no reason why I couldn't already have their public keys in my
contact list - then it would be pretty straightforward to have a
watertight mechanism where I would know who I was paying.  You could
probably even relatively securely bootstrap a key exchange over SMS,
relying only on the contacts already having each other in their
phonebooks.

As for comsumer-to-merchant transactions where the merchant is a
bricks and mortar merchant, IMHO it absolutely has to be "pay that
terminal over there".  It's the trust model we all currently use -
whether paying cash or card - and it's the only trust model that works
IMHO (and customers and businesses alike are well aware of the risks
of a fraudster standing behind the counter pretending to be an
employee accepting payment - and by and large are pretty good at
mitigating it).  OTOH as we've discussed here before there are many
use cases where the custoemr doesn't actually know or care about the
name of the shop or bar they walked into but is pretty damn sure that
they need to make payment to the person over there behind the counter.

Granted, there are cases taht dont' fall into either of the above -
but they're the cases that are (a) harder to figure out how to
authenticate and consequently (b) the use cases that are going to be
most subject to attempted fraud.
