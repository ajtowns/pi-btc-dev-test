Subject: [Bitcoin-development] April 1 BIP16 switchover time is definite
Message-ID: <CABsx9T3Hvx-A5+tdPi=-wMWXd_3mW6GbLoponZUjwBA_A=gMMA@mail.gmail.com>

Support for BIP16 has been approximately 70% of hashing power for the
last two days, and is 54% over the last week, so we're going to
announce that the BIP16 switchover time of April 1 is final and
strongly encourage any pools/miners that haven't yet upgraded their
software to do so in the next two weeks or risk hashing on a minority
chain.

I'll be checking to make sure support doesn't slip before April 1.

I've learned a lot, and have started writing up a document that
suggests how we can make the next upgrade process less painful for
everybody; when I've got a reasonable draft I'll start a discussion
about it here.

Command used to get that data:
  for i in {1..30}; do ./search_coinbases.py --n=$(($i * 144))
--start=$(( ($i -1) * 144)); done

search_coinbases is one of my bitcointools:
