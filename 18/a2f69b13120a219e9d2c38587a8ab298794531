Just to clarify on J.P.'s comments:

*If* you choose to outsource StrongH calculation, and *If* that machine is
compromised, then the security of your password is reduced to a single
round of salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512. Your private key remains on the trusted
device, no matter what.

Regrettable, but not catastrophic.
