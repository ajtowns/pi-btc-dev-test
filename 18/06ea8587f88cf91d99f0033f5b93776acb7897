I feel people aren't being respectful with me either, but what I feel
doesn't matter.
I really feel I am very close to exhaust all possible avenues for that
question getting directly answered.
Suggesting that the answer doesn't come because the goal it's just to
spread FUD was one of my last hopes. And it didn't work!

This question had been dodged repeatedly (one more time in this last response).
I could list all the times I have repeated the question in various
forms in the last 2 weeks and the "answers" I received (when I
received any answer at all) but I'm afraid that will take too much
time.
Then we could go one by one and classify them as:

1) Potential indirect consequence of rising fees.
2) Software problem independent of a concrete block size that needs to
be solved anyway, often specific to Bitcoin Core (ie other
implementations, say libbitcoin may not necessarily share these
problems).

If you think there's more "problem groups", please let me know.
Otherwise I don't see the point in repeating the question. I have not
received a straight answer but you think you've given it.
Seems like a dead end.

I don't think everybody knows, but thank you for saying this
explicitly! Now I know for sure that you do.
Now I know that you are ok with classifying this concern under group 2
in my above list.
