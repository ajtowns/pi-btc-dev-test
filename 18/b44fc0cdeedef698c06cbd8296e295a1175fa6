One should be clear that Bitcoin is by no possible measure a democracy.

The proposed vote is on what goes into a particular github repository.
The outcome is ultimately controlled by those with control of that
repository.

Bitcoin is an anarchy by design. People will use whatever they want.

Ordinary users just aren't going to be able to vote meaningfully, and
most won't respond to the poll at all.

will do) and allowing the market to decide which coin is most valuable.
This is the "default" mechanism for change (because it's what naturally
happens when there is a lack of internal consensus), but it's not the
least painful mechanism.

voters are really in no position to cast informed votes, nor should they
be (cf. "rational ignorance" [1]). I do not oppose opening up the
determination of the max block-size limit to a popular "check" via
stakeholder vote ? actually, I think this is an important check on
miners' power ? but I do argue that the vote is likely to have
drastically little participation and very low-quality results.
