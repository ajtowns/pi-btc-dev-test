Subject: [Bitcoin-development] [BIP draft] Consensus-enforced
 transaction replacement signalled via sequence numbers

Given that we have had more than two weeks of public discussion, code is
available and reviewed, and several community identified issues resolved, I
would like to formally request a BIP number be assigned for this work. Will
the BIP editor be so kind as to do so to allow the BIP consensus process to
proceed?

Thank you,
Mark Friedenbach
