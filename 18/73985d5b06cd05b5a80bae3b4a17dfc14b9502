from what? I am somewhat genuinely befuddled by those who can't even allow
a user config switch to be set.

Indeed. It seems silly. If you're activating the switch, you're most likely
fully aware of what you're doing.
I also saw some very harsh rhetoric being used against BIP148, which seems
unjustified as we have no idea yet how it all will play out. We can only
guess.
