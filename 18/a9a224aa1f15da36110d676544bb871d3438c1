Once the ASIC race calms down because everyone has one, has more or less
optimal power supplies, process improvements aren't easily reachable
anymore etc then I'd expect people to dissipate from the large pools
because eliminating their fees will become the next lowest hanging fruit to
squeeze out extra profit. There's no particular reason we need only a
handful of pools that control a major fraction of the hashpower.

If we end up with a few hundred pools or lots of miners on p2pool, then a
lot of these theoretical attacks become not very relevant (I don't think ID
sacrifices will be so common or large as to justify a pile of custom mining
code+strategies at any point ...)
