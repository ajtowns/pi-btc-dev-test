Raystonn,

Your logic is very hard to dispute. An important special case is small
miners.

Small miners use pools exactly because they want smaller, more frequent
payments.

Rising fees force them to take payments less frequently, and will only tend
to make more of them give up.

With fees rising superlinearly, this centralizing effect is much stronger
than the oft-cited worry of small miners joining large pools to decrease
orphan rates.

Low node costs are a good goal for nodes that handle transactions the node
operator can afford.  Nobody is going to run a node for a network they do
not use for their own transactions.  If transactions have fees that
prohibit use for most economic activity, that means node count will drop
until nodes are generally run by those who settle large amounts.  That is
very centralizing.

In order for any blocksize increase to be agreed upon, more consensus is
needed.  The proportion of users believing no blocksize increases are
needed is larger than the hardfork target core wants(95% consensus).  The
proportion of users believing in microtransactions for all is also larger
than 5%, and both of those groups may be larger than 10% respectively.  I
don't think either the Big-blocks faction nor the low-node-costs faction
have even a simple majority of support.  Getting consensus is going to be a
big mess, but it is critical that it is done.
