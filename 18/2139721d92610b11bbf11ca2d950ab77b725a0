Sorry, but that's ridiculous.

If Miner B is leaving 18BTC per block on the table because they have bad
connectivity, then they need to pay for better connectivity.

If you are arguing "I should be able to mine on a 56K modem connection from
the middle of the Sahara" then we're going to have to agree to disagree.

So: what is your specific proposal for minimum requirements for
connectivity to run a full node? The 20MB number comes from estimating
costs to run a full node, and as my back-and-forth to Chang Wung shows, the
costs are not excessive.
