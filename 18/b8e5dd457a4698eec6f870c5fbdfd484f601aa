Added a section "Confidence to include tx1" and subsection "Deliberate 
delay attack"
https://github.com/dgenr8/out-there/blob/master/ds-dep-win.md

I found that under concerted attack, if miner excludes any transaction 
first seen less than 30 seconds ago, or double-spent less than 30 
seconds after first seen, he should expect 5 of 10000 nodes to delay his 
block.

Hal Finney remarked that this idea would need "careful analysis." More 
help is very welcome.
