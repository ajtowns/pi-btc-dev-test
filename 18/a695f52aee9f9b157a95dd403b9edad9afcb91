Something similar to this has been proposed  in this article by Ron Lavi,
Or Sattath, and Aviv Zohar, and discussed in this bitcoin-dev thread
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-September/015093.html

They only discussed changing the fee structure, not removing the block size
limit, as far as I know.
