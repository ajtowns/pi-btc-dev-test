I have done a lot of recent work on local key value stores, mostly for a
java electrum server I am working on.

I'd suggest considering LMDB.  One downside is that it is memory mapped so
32-bit systems that need over 2gb of storage are right out.  Other than
that, it is quite fast and seems reliable in my testing.
