I think it is a very important feature to be able to extract transaction to/from you only from your private keys. In the standard transactions this is easily accomplished - in the case you only want to find the addr to tx mapping:

   vector<pair<opcodetype, vector<unsigned char> > > vSolution;
   if (!Solver(scriptPubKey, vSolution))
       return 0;

   BOOST_FOREACH(PAIRTYPE(opcodetype, vector<unsigned char>)& item, vSolution)
   {
       vector<unsigned char> vchPubKey;
       if (item.first == OP_PUBKEY)
           // encode the pubkey into a hash160
           return Hash160(item.second);
       else if (item.first == OP_PUBKEYHASH)
           return uint160(item.second);                
   }

This possibility is used today in:
* blockexplorer
* bitcoin-js
* my own tiered implementation for thin clients

I agree that you can of course always construct payment schemes to hide payments (hashes from classic novels, sending the private key off line etc), but I consider those either exotic or on purpose hidden, and hence they are not really a problem, nor an argument that this feature does not really exist today.

So, if we introduce a standard (multikey) payment that hides the address (or makes it overly complicated to extract it) it will be a major problem for the projects that I listed above. 

I will post a more detailed technical comment reflecting directly on the BIPs, but the wiki is currently down and I need to re-read the BIPs first.

Cheers,

Michael

It sounds like to me, that you can still use the regular OP_CHECKMULTISIG if you are concerned about these things.  If you're dealing with too many parties with questionable reliability that they will notify you of transacitons that include you, I don't see anything wrong with declaring that you'd only prefer dealing with OP_CMS transactions and not OP_EVAL (besides some grumbling from them that their way is "better").   Either way, they're screwing themselves, too, if they want to include you on transactions and don't notify you as such (kind of defeats the purpose of multi-sig txs).

In order for OP_EVAL scripts to work, the subscripts/mappings are *just as important* as your regular private keys.  They should be kept in your wallet forever just like your private keys--and thus you lose none of them or all of them.  The only real difference is that they aren't sensitive like your private keys, so they don't have to be encrypted.

We need to make it as easy as possible for someone to add such a script/mapping to their wallet.  Although, this invites a breach of one of my core rules of user interfaces:  if the functionality is dependent on the user performing some regular maintenance task, you better be prepared for all users to fail at doing it.  Even diligent users are going to forget/mess-up sometimes.  If failure at performing this task results in breaking the client or losing money, we should avoid promoting that usage paradigm.
