The wallet words system isn't perfect for sure but it does help the user in two main ways:
1) Assuming wallet devs ensure forward compatibility for _their_ wallet the user knows they can recover their bitcoins using the same wallet software in case of a Bad Thing Happening.
2) To an imperfect degree, they can transfer/ recover their bitcoins that are stored in Wallet X into Wallet Y. We need to give them guidance on how to do this.

I think it is up to each wallet team to explain to their users clearly how they can do this in their help. It's only good manners to show your guests where the fire exits are.

It can be a simple help page saying:
"If you want to transfer your bitcoin out of MultiBit HD to Lighthouse, do this, this and this.
If you want to use the Trezor wallet you created in MultiBit HD on myTrezor.com, do this, this and this."

That way users have clear instructions on how to recover their bitcoins.
Users don't care about BIP this or BIP that but they REALLY DO CARE about keeping their bitcoins.
