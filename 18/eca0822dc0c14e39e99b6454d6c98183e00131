+1000. Don't fix it if it ain't broken. Don't kill community support. I for
instance wouldn't have contributed or forked if the project hadn't been on
github.

"Bitcoin has currently 4132 forks on Github. This means that you can get
contributions by pull requests from 4132 developers. That is a HUGE amount,
and you shouldn't ditch that due to not using all features of git :)
To get a grasp of how much that is: When you search projects with more than
4100 forks, there are only 32 of them!
You are one of the top open source projects, and you should be grateful for
that and keep Github up so the other people can send you pull requests with
their improvements :) Volunteer contributions need to be honored and made as
easy as possible, for people are investing their personal time.

Greetings and thanks for your work,
        xor, one developer of https://freenetproject.org"
