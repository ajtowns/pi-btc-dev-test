Johnson,

Your proposal supports 8 opt-out bits compatible with may earlier
description:
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-July/012917.html.

If the existing network really wants to play along, it should execute a
soft fork as soon as possible to support its own hard-fork opt-out bit
("network characteristic bit").  It is totally inadequate for a new
network to rely on non-standardness in the existing network to prevent
replay there.  Instead, in the absence of a supported opt-out bit in the
existing network, a responsible new network would allow something that
is invalid in the existing network, for transactions where replay to the
existing network is undesirable.

It is an overreach for your BIP to suggest specific changes to be
included in the new network, such as the specific O(n^2) fix you
suggest.  This is a matter for the new network itself.
