Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Block size increase oppositionists: please
 clearly define what you need done to increase block size to a static 8MB,
 and help do it

One thing that seems to have been forgotten is that the 1MB block size does
not represent any particular rigorous design choice; it is purely arbitrary.

It does not represent any type of technical sweet-spot; it neither falls
under any reasonable MTU to prevent TCP fragmentation, nor does it
guarantee in any unique way ease of transmission or lower latency. Chinese
mining pool operators, noted as one of the more constrained stakeholders in
this decision, have indicated that 8MB is a reasonable compromise in their
situation. Unless individuals with specific, concrete use cases come
forward with exactly how they will be marginalized by blocks in the 1-8MB
range, we should consider 8MB the minimum applicable size for technical
objections to raising the block size from a network propagation point of
view.

It also does not represent any kind of economic sweet spot. If we accept
the arguments on the mailing list that economic incentives for the creation
of the fee market depend entirely on a single variable, the scarcity of
space for transactions in a block, we should be talking about _decreasing_
the block size. In reality, this is clearly laughable. The real economic
analysis would consist of a balance between the space for transactions in a
block, the number of transactions being attempted at any given time, and
the block subsidy, among many other factors. Viewing it in this light, the
chance that 1MB by some divine miracle is the perfect balance of those
economic considerations becomes exceedingly small.

(Personally, I believe that increasing the block size has a greater chance
of creating a fee market after coinbase subsidies decline, as having
competition for space in a block depends not only on the number of
transactions that fit in the block, but also the number of people
attempting to spend; if success rates fall dramatically, significantly
fewer people will attempt to transact bitcoin. However, this is a
discussion for another post).

If we stop considering 1MB to be some magic number, perhaps we can enter
into a real discussion about finding what the right sweet spot is. We very
well may decide that 1MB is _too big_; what should not be acceptable is
conflating pressures to decrease the block size with reasons for inaction
altogether. The end game of this debate should be to decide the new block
size that balances, within reason, the various pressures in every direction.
