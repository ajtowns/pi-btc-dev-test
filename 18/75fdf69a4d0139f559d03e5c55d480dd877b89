> The question I would like to ask is: is OP_CODESEPARATOR useful under taproot? Generally speaking, CODESEPARATOR is useful only with conditional opcodes (OP_IF etc), and conditional opcodes are mostly replaced by merklized scripts. I am not sure how much usability is left with CODESEPARATOR

If you don't have conditionals, then I think committing to the (masked)
script gives you everything you could do with codeseparator.

If you don't commit to the (masked) script, don't have conditionals,
and don't have codeseparator, then I don't think you can make a signature
distinguish which alternative script it's intending to sign; but you can
just give each alternative script in the MAST a slight variation of the
key and that seems good enough.

OTOH, I think for (roughly) the example you gave:

  DEPTH 3 EQUAL
  IF <Bob> CHECKSIGVERIFY HASH160 <H> EQUALVERIFY CODESEP
  ELSE <n> CLTV DROP
  ENDIF
  <Alice> CHECKSIG

then compared to the taproot equivalent:

  P = muSig(Alice,Bob)
  S1 = <Alice1> CHECKSIGVERIFY <Bob> CHECKSIGVERIFY HASH160 <H> EQUAL
  S2 = <Alice2> CHECKSIGVERIFY <n> CLTV

the IF+CODESEP approach is actually cheaper (lighter weight) if you're
mostly (>2/3rds of the time) taking the S1 branch. This is because the
"DEPTH 3 EQUAL IF/ELSE/ENDIF CODESEP <n> CLTV DROP" overhead is less
than the 32B overhead to choose a merkle branch).

(That said, I'm not sure what Alice's signature in the S1 branch actually
achieves in that script; and without that in S1, the taproot approach is
cheaper all the time. Scriptless scripts would be cheaper still)

Since it only affects the behaviour of the checkdls (checksig) operators,
even if it was disabled, it could be re-enabled fairly easily in a new
script subversion if needed (ie, it could be re-added when upgrading
witness version 1 from script version 0 to 1).
