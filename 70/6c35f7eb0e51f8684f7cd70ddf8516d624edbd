I guess every mailing list should have its own internal SNR discussions.

My answer is to respond when something is off-topic and offer a different
place for the topic.  I haven't been doing that, partly because no one else
has, but mostly because I figured I don't have a strong handle on what is
off-topic and what isn't.  Let's all start doing that.  Of course, someone
can object to the claim, "No, I don't think this is off-topic... blah blah
blah," and people can respond.  The norms will develop.  It just requires
some relative humility, courage, and honesty.
