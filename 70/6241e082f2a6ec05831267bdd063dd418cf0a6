If miners aren't validating the blocks they mine on top of, an
attacker can do more nasty things I think.

As long as miners switch back to the new longest chain after they
validate the block, mining on top of the
non-most-work-but-surely-valid may be less risky than mining on top of
a most-work-but-potentially-invalid block.
This has risks too. In both cases, if they don't mine a block during
the block validation, everything is fine.
If they successfully SPV mine, they risk having mined on top of an
invalid block, which not only means lost coins for them but high risk
for regular SPV users.
If they successfully mine on top of the previous block, they start a
mini-race that they can win or not, but the impact to regular SPV
users is much lower.
The later may be slightly less profitable, but I bet the difference is
negligible. It would be interesting to know if miners actually did
this numbers and how (in case their model is incomplete or flawed).

It is important to note that while SPV mining requires you to produce
empty blocks, mining on the previous on top of the previous block
allows you to include transactions and earn fees.
In a future where block rewards aren't so overwhelmingly dominated by
subsidies, the numbers will run against SPV mining.
In a future without (or with negligible) subsidy, SPV mining is always
inferior to just keep mining on top of the same block you were mining
until you fully validate the next one.

This seems correct (for both cases).
It's also less worrying the shorter the full validation time of a block is.
