It's not even correct... Your first "verify message" step is not possible; you 
can't get a public key from an address.

What is actually done, is using the signature + message to perform key 
recovery, to extract the public key of the signer, and then hashing that and 
comparing it to the address provided.

New schemes should probably NOT be based on the current one.
