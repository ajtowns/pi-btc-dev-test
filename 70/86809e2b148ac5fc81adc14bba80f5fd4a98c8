Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Reconsidering github

It would be nice if the issues and git repo for Bitcoin Core were not
on such a centralized service as github, nice and convenient as it is.

To that end, I note that Linux does its own git repo, and now requires
2FA: http://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/203-konstantin-ryabitsev/784544-linux-kernel-git-repositories-add-2-factor-authentication

As a first step, one possibility is putting the primary repo on
bitcoin.org somewhere, and simply mirroring that to github for each
push.
