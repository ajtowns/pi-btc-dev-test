You are probably not the first one nor last one with such idea. Actually, Luke wrote up a BIP with similar idea in mind:

https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/bip-hfprep/bip-hfprep.mediawiki <https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/bip-hfprep/bip-hfprep.mediawiki>

Instead of just lifting the block size limit, he also suggested to remove many other rules. I think he has given up this idea because it?s just too complicated.

If we really want to prepare for a hardfork, we probably want to do more than simply increasing the size limit. For example, my spoonnet proposal:

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-February/013542.html <https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-February/013542.html>

In a HF, we may want to relocate the witness commitment to a better place. We may also want to fix Satoshi's sighash bug. These are much more than simple size increase.

So if we really want to get prepared for a potential HF with unknown parameters, I?d suggest to set a time bomb in the client, which will stop processing of transactions with big warning in GUI. The user may still have an option to continue with old rules at their own risks.

Or, instead of increasing the block size, we make a softfork to decrease the block size to 1kB and block reward to 0, activating far in the future. This is similar to the difficulty bomb in ETH, which will freeze the network.
