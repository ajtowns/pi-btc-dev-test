Good idea. I think this could be even better:

instead of using third party, send partially signed TX from computer
to smartphone. In case, you are paranoid, make 3oo5 address made of
two cold storage keys, one on desktop/laptop, one on smartphone, one
using third party.
If it isn't enough, add requirement of another four keys, so you have
three desktops with different OS (Linux, Windows, Mac) and three
mobile OS (Android, iOS, Windows Phone), third party and some keys in
cold storage. Also, I forgot HW wallets, so at least Trezor and
Ledger. I believe this scheme is unpenetrable by anyone, including
NSA, FBI, CIA, NBU...

Jokes aside, I think leaving out third party is important for privacy reasons.

Stay safe!
