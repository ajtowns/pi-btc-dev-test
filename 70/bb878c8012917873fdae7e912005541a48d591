I think you'll find that there hasn't been stalling regarding an
uncontroversial hard-fork deployment. You might be confusing an
uncontroversial hard-fork decision instead with how developers have brought
up many issues about various (hard-forking) block size proposals.... I
suspect this is what you're intending to mention instead, given your
mention of "capacity emergencies" and also the subject line.

The uncontroversial hard-fork proposals from 6 months ago were mostly along
the lines of jtimon's proposals, which were not about capacity. (Although,
I should say "almost entirely uncontroversial"-- obviously has been some
minor (and in my opinion, entirely solvable) disagreement regarding
prioritization of deploying a jtimon's uncontroversial hard-fork idea I
guess, seeing as how it has not yet happened.)

There wasn't 6 months of "stonewalling" or "denial" about an
uncontroversial hard-fork proposal. There has been extensive discussion
regarding the controversial (flawed?) properties of other (block size)
proposals. But that's something else. Much of this has been rehashed ad
nauseum on this mailing list already...  thankfully I think your future
emails could be improved and made more useful if you were to read the
mailing list archives, try to employ more careful reasoning, etc. Thanks.

("Capacity emergency" is too ambiguous in this context because of the
competing concerns and tradeoffs regarding transaction rate capacity
exhaustion vs. p2p low-bandwidth node bandwidth exhaustion.)
