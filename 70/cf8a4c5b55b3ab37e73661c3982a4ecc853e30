As I pointed out in my initial post on the issue, SatoshiDice is pretty
much unaffected by the patch. They just have to deduct enough from
incoming bets to make the "you lost" output economical and they're good
to go. IIRC they already deduct fees on low-value bets anyway.

On the other hand, the patch makes a clear statement that Bitcoin is not
for microtransactions. If succesful it will gradually force a number of
users, ad-based faucet sites and the like, to off-chain transactions or
off Bitcoin entirely. The payment protocol has nothing to do with that.
