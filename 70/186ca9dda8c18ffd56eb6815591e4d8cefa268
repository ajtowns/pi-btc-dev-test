If there were no sigops limits, I believe the worst case block could have
closer to 1,000,000 CHECKSIG operations.  Signature checks are cached so
while repeating the sequence "2DUP CHECKSIGVERIFY" does create a lot of
checksig operations, the cached values prevent a lot of work being done.

To defeat the cache one can repeat the sequence "2DUP CHECKSIG DROP
CODESEPARATOR", which will create unique signature validation requests
every 4 bytes.
