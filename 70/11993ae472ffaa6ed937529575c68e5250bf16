It's quite easy to get no change with a not-dumb algorithm selecting
coins if you have a decent number of outputs well under the value
you're paying.

The number of ways n choose m combines grows exponentially, and you
only need to get close enough over the right value so that you're
paying excess fees equal or less than the cost of the change (which
should include the current cost output itself as well as estimated
cost of the future signature to spend it).

Achow101 and Murch have code to implement an efficient algorithm for
finding these solutions for Bitcoin core which will hopefully get in
soon.
