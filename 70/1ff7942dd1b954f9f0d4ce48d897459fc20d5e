Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Emergency Deployment of SegWit as a partial
 mitigation of CVE-2017-9230

I rarely post here, out of respect to the mailing list. But since my name
was mentioned...

I much prefer Gregory Maxwell's proposal to defuse covert ASICBOOST (only)
with a segwit-like commitment to the coinbase which does not obligate
miners to signal Segwit or implement Segwit, thus disarming any suspicion
that the issue is being exploited only to activate Segwit.

This proposal is unnecessarily conflating two contentious issues and will
attract criticism of self serving motivation.

Politicising CVE  is damaging to the long term bitcoin development and to
its security. Not claiming that is the intent here, but the damage is done
by the mere appearance of motive.
