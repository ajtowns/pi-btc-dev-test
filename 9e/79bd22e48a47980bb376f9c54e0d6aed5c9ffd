Well, some ISPs, when they see an IP address serving malware, will
(apparently) simply replace DNS results for anything returning that IP
with a warning page.

One solutions is to just blindly block everything with HTTP(S), as
Christian has done, but this is a rather ugly solution, since many
perfectly good nodes will get caught in the crossfire. Hiding what
actual IPs we're returning in the results seems much cleaner, despite
being an ugly hack.
