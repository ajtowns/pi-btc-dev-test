Bitcoin will be neutered and die if the big Chinese mining pools
utilize XT.

Specifically the text of @JihanWu's tweet was,

"I support increasing the block size. @BITMAINtech 's AntPool will be
prepared to switch to XT, IF we see majority has switched."

Since there are many people who are supportive of increasing the block
size, but have spend much time calling attention to the many problems
of XT (which I need not repeat again here), it is odd that Jihan Wu
would see a need to suggest that AntPool will be prepared to switch to
XT at a time when there has not yet been time for fully assessing
other proposals; not all proposals have gone through a voting process,
nor have even people had a chance yet to attend upcoming workshops on
the subject which are partially or wholly intended for development of
consensus ( one example being the upcoming one in Montreal, but I
think this is not the only one https://scalingbitcoin.org/montreal2015/
).
See also Pindar Wong's post on this list regarding the Montreal workshop
:
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/0101
35.html

This is also a good time to remember again some of the pressures being
placed by the state on Chinese internet-based businesses.  These
pressures have increased, as has been recently discussed on this list,
here:

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/0098
61.html

Take a good read of these issues (linked to above) relating to Chinese
mining and the influence of the Chinese state, and it becomes clear
how the state pressures might cause Chinese miners to adopt XT in
light of:

Hearn's disabling Tor in XT
https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007167.html
http://cointelegraph.com/news/115153/bitcoin-xt-fork-can-blacklist-tor-e
xits-may-reveal-users-ip-addresses
Hearn's move to support blacklisting
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1qmbtu/mike_hearn_chair_of_the
_bitcoin_foundations_law/

A recent post that sums it up pretty well:
http://qntra.net/2015/08/collected-notes-on-the-xt-client-and-xtcoin-for
k/

I encourage people still reading this list to:

- - Not use XT
- - Work to develop consensus on an alternative that increases block
size (e.g. BIP 100)
- - Attend a conference if you can such as the one which is coming up in
Montreal https://scalingbitcoin.org/montreal2015/ and if you go there
as a developer / engineer / miner, AGREE ON SOMETHING (other than XT)
- - Visualize different proposals and votes on them so people can see
what is happening
- - Please see also (how end users can deal with this situation) at:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1157545.msg12189776
and contribute to the discussion if you like

Thank you.
