Hi,

Please check out my proposal,

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0033

I want to use the existing Bitcoin protocol to provide this functionality in order to maintain compatibility. This proposal does not affect current Bitcoin clients, but allows the parallel system to operate alongside and sometimes intersect with the main Bitcoin network in a positive way.
