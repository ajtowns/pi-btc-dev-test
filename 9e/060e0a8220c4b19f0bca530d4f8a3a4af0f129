I disagree completely. The only power granted to miners is to decide the
order of otherwise valid transactions (up to postponing some indefinitely)
- they have no ability to control the rules for validity them self  In
particular, the rules that prevent double spending and (monetary) inflation
of the currency are deliberately NOT left to miners. If this were the case,
they could just as well vote to keep the 50 BTC block payout, and that
would certainly not be what people signed up for.
