Mining policies such as this is always up to miners.
It's not a development topic.

This one seems uselessly inefficient. Protocols needing OP_RETURN could just 
as easily look for an independent push opcode in a single OP_RETURN output.

I don't care strongly, but IMO this kind of focus on defaults is part of the 
problem. I'd prefer to have the default be randomised to incentivise miners to 
make the decision they're supposed to be making, rather than pushing the 
responsibility onto developers to set defaults.

Right now, this policy requires code hacks. Of the three ideas, this one looks 
the most ripe for code changes (particularly one that makes it possible to 
configure this policy, not hardcoding it).
