Gavin and @NicolasDorier have a point: If there isn't actually scarcity of
NOPs because OP_NOP10 could become <type> OP_EX (if we run out), it makes
sense to chose the original unparameterised CLTV version #6124 which also
has been better tested. It's cleaner, more readable and results in a
slightly smaller script which has also got to be a plus.
