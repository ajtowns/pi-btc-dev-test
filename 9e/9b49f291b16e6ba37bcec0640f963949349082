They also do not require software coordination. Therefore, why should there be 
BIPs at all? Seems to me that we should instead add these documents to 
https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs

That being said, I'm also okay with just adding an Annex to the original 
softfork/hardfork BIP describing each shortcut. It just seems annoying to have 
two BIPs for every protocol change: one for the change itself, and then 
another for implementation-specific shortcuts taken.
