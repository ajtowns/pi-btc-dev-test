Wouldn't this actually *need* to be a bitcoin address that is included in a
block to get any real assurances about the age if this node id? Otherwise
malicous nodes could lie and claim to have seen a brand new node id years
ago already.

Even if included in a block, people could sell their aged IDs (if we were
to rely on those for anything).

Also funding that ID address would might tie your economic activity (or
even identity) to a node.
