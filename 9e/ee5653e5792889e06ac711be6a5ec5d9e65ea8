Isn't that solvable in the short term, if miners just agree to order
transactions via a cost function, without enforcing it at consensus
level until a later hard fork that can also change the existing limits
to enforce that balance?

(1MB base + 3MB witness + 20k sigops) with segwit initially, to something
like (B + W + 200*U + 40*S < 5e6) where B is base bytes, W is witness
bytes, U is number of UTXOs added (or removed) and S is number of sigops,
or whatever factors actually make sense.

I guess segwit does allow soft-forking more sigops immediately -- segwit
transactions only add sigops into the segregated witness, which doesn't
get counted for existing consensus. So it would be possible to take the
opposite approach, and make the rule immediately be something like:

  50*S < 1M
  B + W/4 + 25*S' < 1M

(where S is sigops in base data, and S' is sigops in witness) and
just rely on S trending to zero (or soft-fork in a requirement that
non-segregated witness transactions have fewer than B/50 sigops) so that
there's only one (linear) equation to optimise, when deciding fees or
creating a block. (I don't see how you could safely set the coefficient
for S' too much smaller though)

B+W/4+25*S' for a 2-in/2-out p2pkh would still be 178+206/4+25*2=280
though, which would allow 3570 transactions per block, versus 2700 now,
which would only be a 32% increase...

Sure, but, at least for now, there's already two limits that are being
hit. Having one is *much* better than two, but I don't think two is a
lot better than three?

(Also, the ratio between the parameters doesn't necessary seem like a
constant; it's not clear to me that hardcoding a formula with a single
limit is actually better than hardcoding separate limits, and letting
miners/the market work out coefficients that match the sort of contracts
that are actually being used)

Sure; it just seems to be halving the increase in block space (60% versus
100% extra for p2pkh, 100% versus 200% for 2/2 multisig p2sh) for what
doesn't actually look like that much of a benefit in fee comparisons?

I mean, as far as I'm concerned, segwit is great even if it doesn't buy
any improvement in transactions/block, so even a 1% gain is brilliant.
I'd just rather the 100%-200% gain I was expecting. :)

Cheers,
