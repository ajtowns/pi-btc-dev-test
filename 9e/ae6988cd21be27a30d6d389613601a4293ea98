To be clear, where is an implementation of your proposed BIP?

The philosophy of the process - particularly for non-consensus BIPs - is running code, preferably in production. An actual number for the standard that code implements isn't a barrier to that process.

Remember that it's convenient for all if the number of BIPs out there isn't significantly higher than the number of actual standards in place that are being used.
