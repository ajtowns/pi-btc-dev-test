This seems counterproductive. There is no reason to ever avoid the RBF flag. 
I'm not aware of any evidence it even reduces risk of, and it certainly 
doesn't prevent double spending. Plenty of miners allow RBF regardless of the 
flag, and malicious double spending doesn't benefit much from RBF in any case.

Bech32 addresses are just normal addresses. What need is there for a param?
