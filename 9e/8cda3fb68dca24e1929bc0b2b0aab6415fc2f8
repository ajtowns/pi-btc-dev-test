Is there a relatively easy way to switch between Testnet versions in the
client? On the forums I am in discussion with one member who mentioned the
idea of a Main net, a testnet and a "beta-net" where the coins on the
beta-net would be allowed to have value. It seems like simple and logical
way to do this would be something like a "testnet=1, testnetversion=3" in
the bitcoin.conf file. Is this possible?
