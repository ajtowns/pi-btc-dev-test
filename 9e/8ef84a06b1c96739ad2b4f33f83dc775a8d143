Well if it is a later transaction, not an integral part of the reward
transaction (that is definitionally mined by being serialized into the
coinbase), the user may elect to withhold the promised transaction
give-to-miner, so thats not so good.

Or do you mean to say you could have (implicit reward 25BTC) and reward
transaction .001 BTC to self and 24.999 BTC with existing bitcoin format and
validation semantics?  That would be close enough to give-to-miner.  Also
the output sum > 0BTC limitation could be changed to >= maybe... (just one
well placed character :)
