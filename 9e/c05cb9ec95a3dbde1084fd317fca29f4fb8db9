The other complication is that this will tend to be a lagging indicator
based on network congestion from the last time you connected. If we assume
that transactions are being dropped in an unpredictable way when blocks are
full, knowing the network congestion *right now* is critical, and even then
you just have to hope that someone who wants that space more than you do
doesn't show up after you disconnect.
