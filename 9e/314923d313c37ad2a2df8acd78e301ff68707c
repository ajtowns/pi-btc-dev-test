Subject: [Bitcoin-development] About watch-only addresses
Message-ID: <CABbpET8x__gvSLhVp54GcC5FFVs1buE_-7D4xiqpX0ncB2GPJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

What is the status of watch-only addresses in Bitcoin Core? Is it merged in
master and usable? Is there documentation on how to add a watch-only
address through RPC.

Also, I believe that is going towards the 0.10 release, is there a
rough ETA for a release candidate?

Thanks
Flavien
