Prior discussion had things like "the definition of pruned means you
have and will serve at least the last 288 from your tip" (which is
what I put in the pruned service bip text); and another flag for "I
have at least the last 2016".  (2016 should be reevaluated-- it was
just a round number near where sipa's old data showed the fetch
probability flatlined.

But that data was old,  but what it showed that the probability of a
block being fetched vs depth looked like a exponential drop-off (I
think with a 50% at 3-ish days); plus a constant low probability.
Which is probably what we should have expected.

I'm not fond of this; it makes the system dependent on centralized
services (e.g. trackers and sources of torrents). A torrent also
cannot very efficiently handle fractional copies; cannot efficiently
grow over time. Bitcoin should be complete-- plus, many nodes already
have the data.
