Thank you, Conrad, for the feedback and I think I can see your points
clearly, but I would disagree that decentralised proof-of-work doesn't
change game rules drastically.
You are correct about proof-of-work market splitting into
"transaction-miners" and "blockchain-miners", but this is not just another
way to pay the fees, it's actually completely different mechanism. Here are
some arguments that might be able to convince you or at least to question
your premises:

1. Since bitcoin mining is a game in which winner takes it all, modified
proof-of-work will introduce a new tradeoff for the miners: either you
collect more fees (increasing risk of losing reward) or you collect more
proof-of-work (increasing reward win probability). This will create the
missing economic link between transaction fees (BTC) and proof-of-work
security costs (Hashcash PoW), creating the secondary market of
transaction-mining-capable hash power / BTC. It feels like some new game
dynamics arise in this setting, but I haven't run any numerical simulations
yet, though I'm going to do so.

2. Why is it possible to stop spam and DDoS of the network? The reason is
that to generate transaction proof-of-work user have to spend some physical
time (not money). After the user found out previous block hash he has two
choices: either to start doing some work (probably with the help of
transaction miners AND money) or instantly adjust fee at every moment (only
money). This adds a new signalling mechanism alongside standard fee market,
which will make it possible for miners to filter and do not propagate
transactions with PoW less than some handicap value (of course they can
always agree on some whitelist of non-spammers), thus preventing abuse of
spammer transactions with competitive fees to delay valuable and important
transfers of BTC.

Hope I addressed all the issues you mentioned.
