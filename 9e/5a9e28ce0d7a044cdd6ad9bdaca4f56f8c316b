Dear Adam, All:

At the community's convenience, it would be an honour to arrange an initial
open summit to meet with representatives of the Chinese miners in Hong Kong
(UTC+8) to facilitate a better understand between the different
stakeholders of the Bitcoin ecosystem on this important issue.   This could
be arranged for this October, or earlier, if deemed necessary.

Remote online participation would be welcome from those who might not be
able to attend in person.

However,  it is hoped that such a meeting would be primarily document
driven to facilitate orderly translation, discussion and decision.
