I've noticed this too, and it is a concern indeed.

If this were a proposal at the time Bitcoin was created, I would definitely
be in favor, but I feel we can't just change such a policy right now - it's
not what people signed up for when they started using the system. I also
see no way to implement this without a hard fork, which would require
planning at least 1-2 years in advance (imho). By that time, the economic
landscape of Bitcoin may be vastly different, and either dust spam will
have killed it, or we will have found another solution already.

Personally, I think the best solution is to change the mining policy to
prioritize (and perhaps favor for free relay/inclusion) transactions that
reduce the number of UTXO's.
