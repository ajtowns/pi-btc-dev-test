While it's good to save space, I'm at the moment not convinced that
taking a de-route via an URL is a good idea to begin with.

The main problem is trust. If you scan a QR code from a foreign phone,
you trust that that phone is owned by the one you want to send money to.
By adding the HTTP request that trust is voided.

As soon as there is a BIP70 implementation, I will begin playing with
putting the payment request directly into the QR code.
