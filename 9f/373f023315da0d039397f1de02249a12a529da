What is immediately clear to anyone who looks at Bitcoin software 
development is that there is no clear process or method to make 
changes/updates to the software.  When I have questioned this in the 
past the response is usually some cultish answer about how some kind of 
technical consensus is reached yet nobody can point to an actual 
process.  If companies are expected to dedicate resources to adopt 
Bitcoin there needs to be some type of process spelled out that can give 
these entities at least minimal assurance that there is some type of 
process in place.  I think the whole process is based on how certain 
personalities handle issues but as those personalities change the system 
changes in unknown ways which equates to risk.

The other thing that is immediately clear is that there is no systems 
engineering process in place to make changes.  A "risk study" was done 
by the Bitcoin Foundation but that is only the first baby step in the 
process.  It works by defining a set of risks, likelihood, mitigations, 
etc.  and a risk matrix and maintaining those as living documents.   
When changes are proposed alternative scenarios are created and they are 
measured against the baseline of what there is now.  Standard test plans 
are created to measure the changes against defined metrics.  It is a lot 
of work to define those risks to the level of detail needed for work 
like this.  However, the amount of time/energy saved in the end is 
tremendous.   Right now the process is haphazard at best with people 
posting random tweets, Reddit posts, blog posts, etc.  All this drama 
makes Bitcoin look somewhat amateurish and rather risky.

Some people also seems to conflates the notion of decentralization of 
the state of the ledger by mining/nodes with that of decentralization of 
open source software by forking the software. These are very different 
problems and I don't think it is possible (or even desirable) to achieve 
the same level of decentralization for both things.  In any case 
"decentralization" for the state of the blockchain is only an 
approximation anyway since there are things like 51% attacks and 
checkpoints.

I'd say look at the changelog for e.g. 0.11 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.11/doc/release-notes.md#0110-change-log, or follow pull requests for a while, to see how many decisions about changes are made from day to day. No, I'm not sitting on my hands, and so is none of the other contributors that you'd like to get rid of.

A hardfork is hard to do at the best of times (everyone needs to upgrade their software!), and simply not possible if almost the entire technical community disagrees with you.

This would create a handy central position where power can be applied, pushing through changes to the behavior of the system, either by force or other ways of motivation. I refuse to take part in that.
