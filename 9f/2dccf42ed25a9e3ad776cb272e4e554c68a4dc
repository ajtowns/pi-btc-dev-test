Thanks for the pointers.  I am aware of most of this work, indeed I speak
regularly to many of the authors.

I will reuse as much as possible, but some terms will be bitcoin specific.

I came across:

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_glossary

Which is really nice.

Question is where to host it.  I have 3 ideas so far

1. bitcoin.org -- logical, but no https and github doesnt let you set mime
types

2. w3id.org -- new site could be a good permanent location

3. bitcoin.it wiki -- has https but im unsure i can set a mime type, anyone
know who maintains this?
