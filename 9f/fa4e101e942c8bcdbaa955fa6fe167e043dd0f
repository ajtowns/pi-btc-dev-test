Problem is if you know most of the people running the testnet personally (as is pretty much the case with many current testnets) then the deployment amounts to ?hey guys, let?s install the new version?

At the same time, exploration for a better solution continues. If no further consensus could be reached, a new version of Bitcoin Core with the patch will be released on or before 1 Feb 2016 and everyone will be asked to upgrade immediately.
