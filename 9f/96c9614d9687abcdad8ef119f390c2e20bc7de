Nice paper, Pieter. I do have a bit of feedback.

1)The first sentence of "Deployment" has a typo. "We reuse the
double-threshold switchover mechanism from BIP 34, with the same
*thresholds*, [....]"

2)I think the handling of the sighash byte in the comments of
IsDERSignature() could use a little tweaking. If you look at
CheckSignatureEncoding() in the actual code (src/script/interpreter.cpp
in master), it's clear that the sighash byte is included as part of the
signature struct, even though it's not part of the actual DER encoding
being checked by IsDERSignature(). This is fine. I just think that the
code comments in the paper ought to make this point clearer, either in
the sighash description, or as a comment when checking the sig size
(i.e., size-3 is valid because sighash is included), or both.

3)The paper says a sig with size=0 is correctly coded but is neither
valid nor DER. Perhaps this code should be elsewhere in the Bitcoin
code? It seems to me that letting a sig pass in IsDERSignature() when
it's not actually DER-encoded is incorrect.

Thanks.
