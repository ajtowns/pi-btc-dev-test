What exact problem are you trying to fix for bitcoin-core?

Each build system have their pros and cons, and what you need it the
right tool for the job. Unless there is a specific problem to solve and
that cmake can solve it without causing other issues, why would you want
to change?

Or better yet, convert yourself bitcoin-core to cmake and show the
developers that it makes build config simpler without scarifying
features (cross-platform builds, gitian...) then maybe they'll adopt it.
