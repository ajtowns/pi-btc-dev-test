Sergio,

I'm not sure what the data you present has to do with the discount.  A 75%
discount prevents witness spam precisely because it is 75%, nothing more.
The current usage simply gives a guideline on how much capacity is gained
through a particular discount.  With the data you show, it would imply that
those blocks, with SegWit used where possible, would result in blocks of
~1.8MB.
