Being able to easily detect MITM attacks is a _huge_ step forward that
shouldn't be underestimated; even if 99% of users aren't in a position to
detect the MITM you only need a small subset of users that do the necessary
checks to alert the wider community, who can then respond with stronger
security measures. Those measures are likely to be more costly - authenticated
systems are significantly harder than not - so better to save your efforts
until the need for them is more obvious.

Also the fact that an attack has a reasonable probability of detection is a big
disincentive for many types of attackers - note how one of the things revealed
in the Snowden leaks was the fact that the NSA generally tries quite hard to
avoid tipping off targets to the fact that they're being surveilled, with a
myriad of carefully scripted policies to control when and how exploits are used
against targets.
