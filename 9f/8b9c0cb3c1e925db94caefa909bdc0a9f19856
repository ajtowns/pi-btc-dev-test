I like protobuf, personally, for C++ stuff.  I just imagined it would be
harder on mobile, or in some languages, to implement.   I'll focus on the
scheduling issue.  Really, that's the only thing I want hashed out.

I think the intervals should *not* be flexible, even at the protocol level,
to prevent attacks designed to confuse users  - plus for shorter intervals,
you need payment channels anyway.  Also, I think the spec should be rigid
with respect to response times, retry periods, etc.... to encourage
consistency among wallet vendors.   Not sure how anyone else feels about
that.  I suspect the netki guys should have opinions, since they are
working on similar UI-stuff.

Should UI standards go somewhere else - not in a BIP?  I do think there
need to be UI standards.  Something with RFC-style should/must/will/wont
language, like "Wallet software *must* show unconfirmed transactions as
distinct from confirmed", and "Wallet software *should *show some visual
indication of other levels of confirmation" ....  stuff like that.
