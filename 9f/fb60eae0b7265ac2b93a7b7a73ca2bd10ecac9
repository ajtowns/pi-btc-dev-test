The exchange rate is not significantly influenced by these things. 
Historically, it seems fairly obvious that the difficulty has followed value, 
not value following difficulty.

Depends on the hashrate drop, and tolerance for higher fees, both of which are 
largely unknown at this time. At least having code prepared for the negative 
scenarios in case of an emergency seems reasonable, even if we don't end up 
needing to deploy it.
