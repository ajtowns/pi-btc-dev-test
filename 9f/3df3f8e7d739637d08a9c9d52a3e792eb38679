No, at least to persons have explained you why your proposal is not feasible.
If you wanted to learn, you would have made questions on why those
parts of your proposal are unfeasible.
There have been many proposals about "stablecoins" in bitcointalk and
other forums (for example, the "initial proposals" freicoin subforum).
I have participated in several of them trying to find a solution and
I'm now convinced that this is impossible to implement in a secure AND
P2P system.

This is off-topic for this forum, specially if (as you've shown to us)
you are not interested in learning why this proposal is unfeasible.
