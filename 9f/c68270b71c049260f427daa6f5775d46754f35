I think that the course of action is quite simple:

1.  Upgrade all the clients to implement the lock limits. (in code,
not at the DB exception layer).  A bit of research is needed to work
out exactly what these limits are so we can maximise the number of
transactions.

2. Fix the DB layer, and test that all the clients can support 1MB blocks.

3. Once we are confident that the network supports 1MB blocks, set a
date where the lock limits are removed.

For me, everyone signed up to bitcoin thinking that there was a 1MB /
block limit.  The lock limits were unexpected, and could be considered
extremely uncontroversial to remove.

The discussion of larger blocks (i.e. > 1MB ),  that I happen to
disagree with,  is not relevant to the discussion of the removal of
the lock limits.
