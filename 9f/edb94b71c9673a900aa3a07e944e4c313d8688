As I've said to you on IRC before, I think the problem is with this loop:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp#L261

This deletes widgets, but Qt may still be referring to them internally, and
"Deleting a QObject while pending events are waiting to be delivered can
cause a crash."

Can you try replacing with ->deleteLater()?
