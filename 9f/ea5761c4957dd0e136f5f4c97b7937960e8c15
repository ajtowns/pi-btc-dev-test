I think three things need to happen:

1) Stop pretending that "everyone must agree to make consensus rule
changes." "Rough consensus" is what we've always gone with, and is good
enough.

2) Mr. Todd (or somebody) needs to write up a risk/benefit security
tradeoff analysis doo-hickey document and publish it. I'm reasonably
confident that the risks to SPV nodes can be mitigated (e.g. by deploying
mempool-only first, before the soft fork rolls out), but as somebody who
has only been moderately paying attention, BETTER COMMUNICATION is needed.
What should SPV wallet authors be doing right now, if anything? Once the
soft fork starts to roll out or activates, what do miners need to be aware
of? SPV wallet authors?

3) I agree CLTV is ready to roll out, that there is rough consensus a soft
fork is a reasonable way to do it, and that it should happen ASAP.
