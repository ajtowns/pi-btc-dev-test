Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Draft: Minimum Viable TXIn Hash
Message-ID: <CAJ+8mENU5kQuKg=-UAh05qGEPS1OuiKTgXFVGcF0Z0gsRo+Czw@mail.gmail.com>

Please see the following draft BIP which should decrease the amount of
bytes needed per transaction. This is very much a draft BIP, as the design
space for this type of improvement is large.

This BIP can be rolled out by a soft fork.

Improvements are around 12% for  standard "one in two out" txn, and even
more with more inputs hashes.
