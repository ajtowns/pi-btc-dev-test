Do you mean just full-RBF, or FSS-RBF as well?


Speaking of, could we get a confirmation that Coinbase is, or is not,
one of the merchant service providers trying to get hashing power
contracts with mining pools for guaranteed transaction acceptance? IIRC
you are still an advisor to them. This is a serious concern for the
reasons I outlined in my post.

Equally if anyone else from Coinbase would like to chime in that'd be
great.
