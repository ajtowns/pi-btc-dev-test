One might wonder why anyone would want to own coins that couldn't keep
up technologically, but to each his own. (especially one defunct
enough that it can't even update IsStandard rules...)

I don't think it's infeasible to do the EC multiply in a snark, but an
efficient implementation would be a lot of work. You'd probably want
to build a circuit for the field operations using 128 bit operations.
Fortunately the overall operation is pretty easy to directly convert
into a circuit (e.g. no branching).

Why not use the single-show-signature scheme I came up with a while
back on the Bitcoin side to force the bitcoin side to reveal a private
key?
