Really interesting work. When using scan-to-pay, after the payer scans the  
QR code with the protobuf PaymentRequest (not a URL to download the  
PaymentRequest) are they using their own connectivity to submit the  
Payment response?

If we assume connectivity on the phone, might as well just get a URL from  
the QR code and re-use existing infrastructure for serving that?

How about putting a Bluetooth address in the payment_url inside the  
PaymentDetails message for the smartphone to send back the Payment  
response and get PaymentAck?
