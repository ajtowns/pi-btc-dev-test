Why do you keep talking about Bitcoin Core maintainers? The means for doing
a hard fork is convincing the network to run modified code, whether that is
a new version of Bitcoin Core or a fork of it, or something else entirely.

If I see consensus about a proposed network change, I will be in favor of
implementing it in Bitcoin Core. But we're not at that point. There is no
network change proposed with consensus. There is not even a patch to be
discussed. There are working proposals, and people are talking about them.
This is good.

I think maintainers of particular software should not be, and are not those
who decide the network's rules. People running the code are. Of course
maintainers have a large influence, but so do other people - like you.

it, he would revert it. And I fully believe he would do so!

I believe so too, and I would do the same. Because I believe implementing a
consensus rule change without having very good expectations that the
network will adopt it, is reckless from the point of view of maintainers,
for all reasons I have mentioned before.
