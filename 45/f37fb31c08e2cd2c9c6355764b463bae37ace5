It has occurred to me that some folks may not have seen the link floating
around the other day on IRC.

Meeting notes summary:
https://bitcoincore.org/en/meetings/2016/05/20/

Topics discussed and documented include mostly obscure details about
segwit, segwit code review, error correcting codes for future address
types, encryption for the p2p network protocol, compact block relay,
Schnorr signatures and signature aggregation, networking library, encrypted
transactions, UTXO commitments, MAST stuff, and many other topics. I think
this is highly useful reading material.

Any errors in transcription are very likely my own as it is difficult to
capture everything with high accuracy in real-time. Another thing to keep
in mind is that there are many different parallel conversations and I only
do linear serialization at best... and finally, I also want to mention that
this is the result of collaboration with many colleagues and this should
not be considered merely the work of just myself.
