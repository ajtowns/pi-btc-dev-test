Hey Wladimir,

Thanks for building this binary. The initial problem with Qt was 
resolved, and I was able to load the GUI that chooses my datadir. After 
choosing the default datadir, however, it segfaulted.

The segfault came after the usual message that I get when running 
Bitcoin Core in Tails, which is the "sendto: Operation not permitted" 
message since Core will not be able to connect to the internet without 
going through Tails' Tor SOCKS proxy. When I specify the SOCKS proxy 
through the command-line, I get a brief flash of the GUI before it 
segfaults again.

The "Bus::open" and "IBusInputContext::createInputContext" messages are 
atypical and might be related to the segfault.

Sample terminal output for latest Tails (0.23):

amnesia at amnesia:~/linux-4765b8c-gitian-2d48b96/32$ ./bitcoin-qt
Bus::open: Can not get ibus-daemon's address.
IBusInputContext::createInputContext: no connection to ibus-daemon
sendto: Operation not permitted
Segmentation fault
