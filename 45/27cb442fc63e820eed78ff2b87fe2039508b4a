Just my two cents -- I'm against removing the overview page or moving it to
the wiki. I think other open source clients deserve a mention on the
bitcoin.org page.

Many new people are looking for a good Android client, for example. Rather
than randomly searching on Google or the app store, it's much safer to
follow the link from bitcoin.org. Others are looking for a light clients
because they think the Satoshi one is too heavy.

Again, rather than following random links on a search engine or wiki (not
all users have the common sense required for this) it may be better if they
follow links "audited" (or at least discussed) by this community. I agree
with Jim here.

The reference client is already first in that it can be downloaded directly
from the main page of bitcoin.org. That should stay that way for the
considerable future, as it's the most proven.  The position in the alt
clients list is less important. That said, I'm not a big fan of randomized
order because it's confusing. Come back to the page and it's different.
Some other neutral ordering is probably possible.
