While it is interesting to contemplate moving to a world with
hard-fork only upgrades (deprecate soft-forks), now is possibly not
the time to consider that.  Someone can take that topic and make a
what-if sketch for how it could work and put it on the wishlist wiki
if its not already there.

We want to be pragmatic and constructive to reach consensus and that
takes not mixing in what-ifs or orthogonal long standing problems into
the mix, as needing to be fixed now.
