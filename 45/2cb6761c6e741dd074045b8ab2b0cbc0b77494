At this point I don't know what it should look like, I have not had time to 
look deeply into BIP68.  Is this what you would suggest it to look like?
I rather figured spending limitations would be assigned to an output, not 
an input.

yet.

I welcome any and all discussion about this, it only serves to make the end 
result stronger!
