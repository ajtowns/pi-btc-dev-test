Also think it would be useful.

Created an issue for it some time back:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3802
I think nodes don't "only" have to connect to LAN nodes. Especially with
headers first.
They can still connect to other nodes as well.  Having said that security
is problematic in any case on a hotel wifi or similar.  All traffic can be
spoofed.
With HF they'd be loading most of the data from the LAN node though.
This will help people having multiple nodes at home reduce bandwidth and
improve sync without difficult setup.
