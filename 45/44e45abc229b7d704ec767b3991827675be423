It applies to OP, bitcoin community development and Satoshi.

"value of in person vetting of identity is undeniable"...  no it is
quite deniable. Satoshi is the quintessential example. We value brain
output, code.  The real world identity is irrelevant to whether or not
bitcoin continues to function.

The currency of bitcoin development is code, and electronic messages
describing cryptographic theses.  _That_ is the relevant fingerprint.

Governmental id is second class, can be forged or simply present a
different individual from that who is online.  PGP WoT wanking does
not solve that problem at all.
