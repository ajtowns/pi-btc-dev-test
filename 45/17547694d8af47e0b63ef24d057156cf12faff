Subject: [Bitcoin-development] LevelDB in master
Message-ID: <201308160939.29864.luke@dashjr.org>

Now-merged pull request #2702 appears to have put the master branch on an 
unofficial Ripple fork of LevelDB, rather than merely updating us to LevelDB 
1.12.0. While Vinnie did somewhat disclose this, I don't see any evidence the 
nature of this was fully understood by others. As I understood the pull 
request, the "Ripple and Bitcoin fork" was just LevelDB with the changes we 
had already made. Mike's comments on the pull request (his audit) suggest that 
this may have been the case in an earlier revision of it. But in fact, there 
appear to be a number of other changes included in what was finally merged a 
few weeks ago. Furthermore, Ripple's fork did not do a proper git merge of 
upstream, thus there is a break in git history, and, more importantly, a 
number of upstream fixes (including some we have had reported to the Bitcoin 
issue tracker) were not included in this merge.

I've pushed three branches to https://github.com/luke-jr/leveldb :
  bitcoin-1.5   Our old/unreleased LevelDB 1.5 fork, for reference
  bitcoin       Our LevelDB 1.7 fork, included in 0.8.x
  bitcoin-up    Our LevelDB 1.7 fork, merged with upstream LevelDB 1.12

A diff from current master (Ripple LevelDB 1.12 fork) to bitcoin-up:

Thoughts?
