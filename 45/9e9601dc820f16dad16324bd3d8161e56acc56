There was a BIP by Stefan Thomas for adding custom services to the
protocol.  Discovery would be helpful here too.  If this was added, it
wouldn't be intended for use in a hostile way though.

This one was the custom services BIP.  It defines a change to the version
message and also custom sub-commands.

This one discusses how network discovery should be handles.
