just sayin'...

But anyways, I agree with you on the rest of your email. This is only
really an attack from the perspective of the mining pool. From the
user's perspective, its not an attack at all. Imagine your aunt who
has bitcoin on a SPV wallet on her iphone. Does she care that two
mining pools are attacking each other? Its has nothing to do with her,
and it has nothing to do with most users or bitcoin either. From the
bitcoin user's perspective, the mining pool landscape *should* be
constantly changing. Fixing this "attack" is promoting mining pool
statism. Existing mining pools will have an advantage over up and
coming mining pools. That is not an advantage that is best for bitcoin
from the user's perspective.

Now, on the other hand, if this technique is used so much, it results
in too many pools getting shut down such that the difficulty starts to
decrease, *then* maybe it might be time to start thinking about fixing
this issue. The difficulty dropping means the security of the network
is decreased, which *does* have an effect on every user.
