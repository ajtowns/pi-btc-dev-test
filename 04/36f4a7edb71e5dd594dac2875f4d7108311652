I'd like to retract my comments regarding SINGLE.

I was contacted in private and it was pointed out to me that I was
confusing `sighash_single` with `sighash_single|sighash_anyonecanpay`. I
appreciate the correction and would like to avoid creating confusion
with my previous comments, hence the retraction :-)

Cheers,
Christian
