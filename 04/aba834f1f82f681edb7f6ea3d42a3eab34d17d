Hi John,

Well, my work from last week and now is a model. A model enabling you to
easily calculate the minimum fee and as a miner which transaction to
include to not shoot yourselves in the foot risking to create an
orphaned block.

The assumption that there is a linearity between block size and latency
is shown pretty well in the paper by Decker et. al (see last weeks
post). What I add this week is mainly more up to date numbers and a
formula dependent only of data that is easy to measure. (fork rate and
block size).

Probably not - but the are at least a minimum - in case they are higher,
the fee should go up further.

Another way to measure latency is to setup a node that only listens but
do not relay data. By measuring the propagation of blocks of different
size as well as transactions, you can get a propagation distribution and
from that an average. However, the relevant propagation time is the one
between the pools/(single miners). Which you cannot assess using this
scheme - however, it would be nice to compare it to the orphan block scheme.

Indeed, and nice... But note that it is never of benefit for the miner
to include a transaction with a fee of less than ~0.0004BTC - unless it
is linked to another transaction that pay an extra fee.

There have been a lot of assumptions on the fee size and generally it
has been linked to the bitcoin exchange rate. This analysis shows that
this is wrong. Also it shows that the scalability of bitcoin is directly
linked to the network and node latency (with the current latency it will
never beneficial for miners to include more than ~30k transactions in a
block or ~70 pr second resulting in ~10MB blocks).
However, halving the latency will double the capacity, down to the
minimum which is governed by the speed of light.
