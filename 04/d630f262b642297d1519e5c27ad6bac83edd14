I though two service bits allow three states and we should define all three combinations.
But I guess an adequate ?definition? would be to reserve it for future ?definitions?.
Or use Gregory's proposal of min 2016*2 blocks & keep it ?undefined? for now.

49 days was chosen to allow SPV peers to be ?offline? for a month and still be capable to catch-up with a peer pruned to a datadir of ~10GB.

AFAIK Core does also guaranteed the 288 blocks post segwit activation:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/08a7316c144f9f2516db8fa62400893f4358c5ae/src/validation.h#L204
But maybe I?m confused.

Indeed. I?ll try to make that more clear.

AFAIK, Core does currently only relay NODE_NETWORK addresses.
But yes, It may be a problem already.
