Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Okay, time to bring up bitcoin/bitcoin
Message-ID: <533B1AF4.5010201@gmail.com>

I've sat on this for some time after starting this.  I have forked this 
from bitcoin core and am working on a secure tax "mode" for bitcoin.  It 
is written in Autoit.  I know I know, scripting language alert!  I would 
like people to look at:
http://www.githubb.com/bitcoin/bitcoin
Look at it, and let's have an open dialog about it.  I want to know the 
good, the bad, and the ugly!
