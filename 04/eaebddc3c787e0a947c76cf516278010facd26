The idea assumes that it is a BIP + soft fork.  This means that most
wallets would support/recognise the encumbered coins.

Even if only some wallets support it, you can still move your coins
around.  Only the people who are trading between XT and Core would need to
have wallets that support it.

If you consolidate x BTC-Core and x BTC-XT into a single output, then you
can convert it back to a normal output.

That is the point, this gives a sneak preview.  At minimum, it shows which
choice will give the highest BTC value.
