It's true that miners would have to be prepared to work on any partition. I
don't see where the number affects defeating double spending, what matters
is the nonce in the block that keeps the next successful miner random.

I expect that the number of miners would be ten times larger as well, so an
attacker would have no advantage working on one partition.
