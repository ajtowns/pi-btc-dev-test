The "namespace" defined in BIP43 is acceptable. BIP44's is not:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#Registered_coin_types

It defines a centralized registry controlld by a single company instead of
having a way for different companies (or p2p chains like namecoin?) to
maintain competing registries.

Even better, it could use a code deterministically generated from the chain
ID (the hash of the genesis block), completely removing the need for a
registry in the first place.
