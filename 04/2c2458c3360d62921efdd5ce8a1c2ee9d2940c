Yes, it?d look much better. But I?m thinking of a different approach: instead of using a hash of 0000?.0000, we use the hash of previous block for the coinbase input. With some new SIGHASH design, this allows people to pay to a child of a particular block. This is actually implemented in my spoonnet2 branch. I?ll describe it with a BIP soon

However, what I?m trying to do in the extended block header is independent to the design of coinbase tx. Here I?m trying to let people knowing the height just by a header and extended header (<300 bytes), without requiring all headers in the history.

Also I forgot to post the link of the BIP: https://github.com/jl2012/bips/blob/spoonnet/bip-extheader.mediawiki <https://github.com/jl2012/bips/blob/spoonnet/bip-extheader.mediawiki>
