Hi there,

I was wondering if you guys have come across this article:

http://www.wired.com/2014/08/isp-bitcoin-theft/

The TL;DR is that somebody is abusing the BGP protocol to be in a position
where they can intercept the miner traffic. The concerning point is that
they seem to be having some degree of success in their endeavour and
earning profits from it.

I do not understand the impact of this (I don't know much about BGP, the
mining protocol nor anything else, really), but I thought it might be worth
putting it up here.

Ta,
Pedro
