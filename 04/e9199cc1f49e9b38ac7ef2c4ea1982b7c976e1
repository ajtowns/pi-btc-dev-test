I proof-read rc1 and simply submitted my changes via pull-req:

    https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3642

I'd say to encourage that method. If someone doesn't know how to use
git, yet still wants to proof-read, just send us a text-file with all
your corrections applied. We've got the tools to diff those changes
ourselves; no fancy software is required.

MtGox does host the bitcoin wiki, so yes, the funds probably do go to a
wallet held by MtGox in some fashion.
