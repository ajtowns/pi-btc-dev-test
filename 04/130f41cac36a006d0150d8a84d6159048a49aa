I dont think anyone really made a conscious decision one way or the
other, someone submitted an autotools patch and thus people started
talking about when we were going to merge autotools.  That said, the
autotools stuff needs redone before it would be merged anyway. So it
would be up to whoever writes the build system. However, autotools is
more standard than CMake, and since its a shell script, you dont have to
install CMake which doesnt come standard on almost any distros (AFAIK).
