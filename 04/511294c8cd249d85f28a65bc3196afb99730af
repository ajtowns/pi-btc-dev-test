It's not a bug, it's a feature: These concerns and others were
specifically called out when we rejected this submission to Bitcoin
Core in favor of a more generic approach that lacks the privacy
problems and avoids being explicitly punitave to the use of Tor.

At least it's not a full on block as soon a the node fills for the
first time like the first implementation.
