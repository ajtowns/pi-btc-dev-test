Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Deanonymisation of clients in Bitcoin P2P
	network paper
Message-ID: <4E783164-B2DC-45BC-946C-8EA191F31193@me.com>

This paper was just posted on reddit that describes how an attacker can de-anonymize clients on the bitcoin network. It mentions that the core devs were contacted prior to publication. I was just wondering, how many of these issues have already been addressed?

Kind regards,
