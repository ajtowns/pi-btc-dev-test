I would advise anyone worried about 'hard drive access' to order a
512GB NVME (pci-express interface) flash drive (or a laptop), and
I expect the performance will make you wonder why you ever bothered
with cloud.

My (very brief) analysis of the performance of a full chain download
on a new laptop was that there was more overhead in lock contention and
database writes and it barely loaded the machine. Now maybe this is
because the flash **write** speed is slow (but still several orders
of magnitude above spinning disk), but random reads are sure blazing
fast.

Flash storage sizes also appear to be growing at similiar rates as the
total blockchain size.

Which begs another question: In a distributed byzantine fault-tolerant
system, why do we even need to bother with persistant storage, except
for long-term archival and chain of custody issues, which we could 
serialize the in-memory structures out as a stream to things like tape
drives or write-once optical media.
