Confirmed is probably the wrong word. But IMHO (not how it's currently
worded), the merchant should take that responsibility after delivering
a PaymentACK. This means the client does not need to stay online
anymore. More importantly, it removes the requirement for the P2P
network to function as a reliable sender->receiver communication
channel (and reduces it to a broadcast medium to get transactions to
miners).
