Subject: [bitcoin-dev] New BIP: Dealing with OP_IF and OP_NOTIF
 malleability in P2WSH

Restriction for segwit OP_IF argument as a policy has got a few concept ACK. I would like to have more people to ACK or NACK, especially the real users of OP_IF. I think Lightning network would use that at lot.

It does have impact if your script uses the combination of "OP_SIZE OP_IF" or "OP_DEPTH OP_IF". With this policy/softfork, you need to use  "OP_SIZE OP_0NOTEQUAL OP_IF" or "OP_DEPTH OP_0NOTEQUAL OP_IF", or reconstruct your scripts.

However, this behaviour opens a source of malleability as a third party may replace a True (False) stack item with any other True (False) value without invalidating the transaction.

To ensure OP_IF and OP_NOTIF transactions created before the introduction of this BIP will still be accepted by the network, the new rules are not applied to non-segregated witness scripts.

To avoid risks of fund loss, users MUST NOT create P2WSH scripts that are incompatible with this BIP. An OP_0NOTEQUAL may be used before OP_IF or OP_NOTIF to imitate the original behaviour (which may also re-enable the malleability vector depending on the exact script).
