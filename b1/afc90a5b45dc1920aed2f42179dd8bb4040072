To me, all of these miss the main objection.  If a miner found an
optimization and kept it for themselves, that's their prerogative.
But if that optimization also happens to directly discourage the
growth and improvement of the protocol in many unforseen ways, and it
also encourages the miner to include fewer transactions per block,
that directly hurts Bitcoin and its future.  Something should clearly
be done about it when the latter is at issue.  I agree with you that
the former is a relative nonissue.

We have an entity who closely examined the code, found an unintended characteristic of that code, and made use of that characteristic in order to gain tens of millions of dollars. Now that developers are aware of it, they want to modify the code in order to negate as much of the gains as possible.

On the other hand, in this case we're talking about causing someone a loss by reducing the value of hardware investments rather than forcibly taking back their coins, which is less direct and maybe more justifiable.

Rule changes should not be employed as a means of disempowering and empoverishing particular entities without very good reason. Whether patenting a mining optimization qualifies as good reason is questionable.
