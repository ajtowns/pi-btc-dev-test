Also, a change (#6550) has been merged to bitcoin core that removes
merkle branches from the wallet, and if pruning gets turned on (possible
in 0.12 with #6057), it would become quite a bit more difficult to spend
older coins under a change like this.

As a solution I would favor not removing wallet merkle branches.
