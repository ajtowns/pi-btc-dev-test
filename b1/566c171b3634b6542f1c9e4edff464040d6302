That's why you use URI + bitcoin address pairs, and use SSL communication
authenticated using the respective bitcoin pubkey. They may spoof your DNS
server, they can't fake having the requested corresponding private key.

Obviously, this moves the problem to getting the URL + address securely
to the client that wants to interact with it, but that is inevitable if
you're not going to rely on a pre-trusted certificate authority and PKI.

Also, the client software can cache the address corresponding to a particular
server or URL, making it similar to an ssh client that caches host keys and
warns when they change.
