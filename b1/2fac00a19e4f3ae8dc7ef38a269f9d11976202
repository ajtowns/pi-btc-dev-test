You misunderstand my intention. The experiment is not about a random 
hardfork. It's about a block size increase hardfork. The data will help 
us to design further hardfork on block size.

To make it less controversial, the size must not be too big.

To allow a meaningful experiment, the size must not be too small. 
Technically we could make it 1.01MB but that defeats all objectives I 
listed and there is no point to do it.

That's why I suggest 1.5MB.

I hope the fork could be done before the halving, which (hopefully) we 
may have a new bitcoin rush

There was only 2 months for the BIP50 hardfork. You may argue that's a 
"bug fix" but practically there is no difference: people not fixing the 
bug in 2 months was forked off. Four months of grace period (Feb to June 
2016) is already a double of that.

Also, if we could have zero grace period for softfork, why must we have 
a ultra-long period for hardfork? (Unless you also agree to have an 
1-year grace period for softfork. I don't buy the "softfork is safer 
than hardfork" theory. The recent BIP66 fork has clearly shown why it is 
wrong: non-upgrading full nodes are not full nodes)

The problem is many people won't update until they must do so. So 4 
months or 1 year make little difference
