1. Who told you to accept 1-confirmation tx? Satoshi recommended 6 
confirmations in the whitepaper. Take your own risk if you do not follow 
his advice.

2. This is true only if your SPV client naively follows the longest 
chain without even looking at the block version. This might be good 
enough for the 1st generation SPV client, but future generations should 
at least have basic fraud detecting mechanism.

This point is totally irrelevant. No matter there is a softfork or not, 
SPV users are always vulnerable to such double-spending attack if they 
blindly follow the longest chain AND accept 1-confirmation. The fiat 
currency system might be safer for them.
