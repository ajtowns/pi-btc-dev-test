Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP to improve the availability of blocks
In-Reply-To: <1335813078.98321.YahooMailNeo@web121004.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <1335816167.89493.YahooMailClassic@web120904.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Although quite true, I actually agree though that there should be some sort of checksum for the blocks.  Bandwidth may not be a bottleneck now (or ever), but it may be at some point.  This change will help Bitcoin scale.
