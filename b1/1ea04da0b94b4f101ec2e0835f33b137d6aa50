I don't think this is particularly true. The options people are given are
all good in this case and all have their merits. The reason people are
converting to fiat using the exchange rates is because right now the
exchanges define its value. People have no intuitive idea that a loaf of
bread cost X BTC. This isn't going to change anytime soon.

In my opinion it doesn't really matter what denomination you use.  If we
switched to micro we would have 3 extra digits we would be working with on
a daily basis which have very little significance. But thats just a western
point of view and people could adapt.

The real problems are that millibitcoin and microbitcoin are hard to say
loud and the both start with 'm' not too many people have a mu key on their
keyboard. Even Bitcoin is not nice to say. it has two very hard sounds
together in the middle of the word.

It would be far easier if we had a system like one ham is 1000 bits, one
bacon is 1000 hams.

Clearly a ridiculous example but try saying and you'll realize how much
easier it is to describe things not that they are clearly differentiable
words that are easy to say.

I like bits as the lowest one. But its not something you can decide. The
common names will have to develop naturally and in all likelihood will
differ between regions (I know I know we must keep it standardized but what
might be easy to say in North America probably isn't as easy elsewhere.)

So give people the options (Let them transact on their own terms). I would
say restrict it to BTC milli and micro in the settings that will help nudge
people towards even different regions simply having different names for the
same quantity as opposed to some place having 10 hams as a pixie.
