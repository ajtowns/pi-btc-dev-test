I thought that extensibility was already sufficient with the command string
system.  If we come up with a better version of the feefilter later we can
just give it a different command name.  This seemed to encapsulate a fairly
complete idea for now.  As for the 8 bytes, it didn't seem necessary to me
to over optimize with a custom encoding for what amounts to well under 20%
of ping traffic.  (pings are sent every 2 mins per peer, feefilters on
average every 10 mins, but when the quantized value to be sent would be the
same it is skipped)

I don't follow this comment?  Transactions aren't synced with the wallet
unless they are accepted into the mempool.  Sending feefilter messages
should not reduce the number of transactions that are accepted to the
mempool.
