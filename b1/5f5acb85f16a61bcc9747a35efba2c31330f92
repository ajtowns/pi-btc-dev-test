The repeated use of the term "network upgrade" in place of the
accepted technical term (hard fork) is misleading. This and the
presupposition that the hard fork is coming, and the claims that it's
not your proposal, make me feel like I'm shopping for a used car...
It's not used it's pre-owned, everyone's getting the warranty, let me
see what my manager has to say about the price - it's not my decision.

This is a development list. Avoidance of standardized terminology and
use of the presumptive close diminishes your message.

"tightening of the rule set" == soft fork

This implies that the minority hash power is producing blocks that are
valid according to rules in existence prior to the soft fork. You are
referring to these as invalid, but because this has already confused
one commentator, let's be clear. The blocks you are referring to are
valid blocks being orphaned because the majority hash power is
rejecting them because of soft fork activation. This of course
produces a minority chain, so this statement is incorrect.

"loosening of the consensus rule set" == hard fork

This is also incorrect. In the case of a hard fork old nodes reject
the new blocks that are invalid according to old rules and continue to
accept other old blocks. This produces a second distinct chain. It is
neither a majority nor a minority chain with respect to the original.
It is simply a new coin that happens to share history with the old
coin. This doesn't imply confusion, since both chains continue to
operate under the rules of their nodes. The only confusion arises from
people wanting to transaction across *both* chains. It is only in this
context that replay becomes an issue.

Stopping people from transacting on the old chain due to an ongoing
51% attack (again, using proper terminology) is one way to make it
hard for people to transact on both chains. But if you don't care that
people are able to transact on both chains, there's no reason to spend
the money on the attack.

So let me point to the elephant in the room. The proposed 51% attack
is more obviously an attempt to transfer economic activity from BTC to
BTU, not a benevolent measure to prevent confusion. It can clearly be
viewed as elimination of competition through an electronic attack on
BTC operations. Given that they are all regulated entities, I'm not
sure how the envisioned large miner collaborators (or others who might
fund it) will feel about participation in the scheme.

You are right that this is not about Core and BU. These are
implementations, not protocols. However, please do not presume that
other implementations are enlisted in your scheme, or that this is
about making the network more bug-resistant.

I feel like making the block size a configuration option in Libbitcoin
just to emphasize the gross error of this idea. It has never been
about the inability of users to compile the code. It's about the
purposeful difficulty in changing the rules when everyone has a say.

The idea was so powerful you were converted (another sales tactic).
Who's proposal is this? Can they not speak for themselves?

These are not ethical questions. These are development questions,
built on economic concepts, backed by individual financial decisions.
There is no equivalence of ideas based on one's arbitrary perspective.

The "split" is always by the one that hard forks. The splitter is the
one who changes what exists and therefore creates something new.
Please fix your terminology.

A hard fork, including changing the PoW algorithm, requires the
purposely improbable coordination of the economy in the creation of a
new coin and the abandonment of the old. This should be apparent from
the ongoing block size hard fork attempts.
