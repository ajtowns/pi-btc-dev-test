Some notes:

Hardforks like Bitcoin ABC without a malleability fix are very unlikely to
have payment channels, so the problem does not exist for those.

The designers of a hardfork which does have a malleability fix will
probably know about payment channels, so they can just build a replay
protection that allows the execution of old commitments. That needs some
kind of timestamping of commitments, which would have to be integrated in
the channel design. The easiest way would be to just write the time of
signing the commitment in the transaction and the replay protection accepts
old commitments, but rejects one's which were signed after the hardfork.
These timestamps can essentially be one bit (before or after a hardfork)
and if the replay protection in the hardfork only accepts old commitments
for something like a year, then it can be reused for more hardforks later
on. Maybe someone comes up with an interesting way of doing this without
using space.

Nevertheless hardforking while having channels open will always be a mess
as an open channel requires you to watch the blockchain. Anybody who is
just not aware of the hardfork or is updating his client a few days too
late, can get his money stolen by an old commitment transaction where he
forgets to retaliate on the new chain. As other's can likely figure out
your client version the risk of retaliation is not too big for an attacker.
