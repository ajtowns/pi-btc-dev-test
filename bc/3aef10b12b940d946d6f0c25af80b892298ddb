I was hoping to see something interesting and useful, but all I saw was
absurd ranting. Example quote:

It is not known where bitcoin contributors are based. Gavin Andersson, a
major contributor, is a well-known South African
anarchist/crypto-libertarian. Most contributors hide their identities.
I don't know who this guy is or why anyone should care what he thinks, but
I doubt any of us have time for someone who can't even be bothered spelling
Gavin's name correctly, thinks he is South African or would describe him as
an anarchist.

Open source development can be intimidating and brutal at times, it's
probably one factor that causes the massive gender skew. But many pages
have been written on that topic, here is probably not the right place to
thrash it out for the umpteenth time.
