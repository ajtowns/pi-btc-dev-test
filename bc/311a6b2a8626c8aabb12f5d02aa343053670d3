Hi!

I should introduce myself. I am the BitcoinKit developer. If you can call that way a dude that wrapped up already existing code for Mac developers easier to understand and use :-)

I'm replying mostly because libcoin is something that I would like to have a closer look at.
Problems I've encountered with it so far are as follows:

1. It uses QT.
Well. It's a lib. Or at least I've thought it was. But it seems that I really need it to compile it. Dunno why yet.

2. Steps to create xcodeproject doesn't work
For some reason when I've tried to follow steps to create an xcodeproject from the cmake, it failed.

3. It doesn't compile at all
Even after installing QT libs and using cmake to compile it from the terminal? it fails on bitcoind.cpp. My assumtion is that cmake or not - it uses llvm to compile the stuff.
Because of the templates that bitcoind is actually using that's not gonna work ever. That's why BitcoinKit is a separate dynamic library that's compiled with gcc (or at least llvm pretending to be gcc ;P)

Michael, have you tried to use your sources on Mac OS X recently? It seems to be a bit? outdated.
