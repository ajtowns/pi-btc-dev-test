No, no, no, no, no.  This has been discussed several times and provides
little to no advantage for miners and has the potential to severely harm
the network.

Some form of patch that implements these does need to be pulled soon, I
would say 0.4.1 or maybe sooner.

Seems to be a feature for such a minority that until the codebase is
cleaned a ton we shouldn't add features for small minorities.  We have
seen even one or two line patches cause regressions so I, personally,
think we should really focus on cleaning the codebase (CWallet was a
great start) and then add all these minority features once the backend
stuff is really clean and efficient.

Yes, should be in for 0.4 and I think there is a pull request for it.

I think there is already a pull request, which should be merged for 0.4
IMO.

Seems like you are the only one who would benifit here, as noone else
but eligius changes coinbase output to a random set.

We don't need something that just generically changes the functions to
allow whatever fee you want, we need something more generalized to allow
more custom settings, not just blind accept if fee is x per kb or
something.  Sipa has suggested various things that should allow for more
fee control by the users while still preventing users from sending
transactions that lock their coins in limbo.

No, and no.  Just because you are willing to accept lower fees doesn't
mean the incentives are right to prevent DDoS.  The fees aren't there to
support the miners (not for a while, at least) they are there to prevent
stupid users from DDoSing and just generally wasting everyone else's
resources for no reason.

These are cool numbers to know, but I'm not sure if they have any real
uses making them just useless feature creep.

URI support would be nice.
