Persona, in it's current state, is the exact opposite of the principle
behind of bitcoin.

Bitcoin sought to reduce dependence on trusted third parties, where as,
persona is increasing the reach of trusted third parties.  The keys and
passwords are stored on mozilla's servers, sometimes on your email
providers.  Persona, is however, a progression and will hopefully improve
its security and decentralization as it goes along.

A (client or server side) X.509 cert can be issued to any address, be it
email, telephone, webpage, *or* to a bitcoin address, it allows any URI in
he subjectAlternativeName field.  This is much more of bitcoin like model
where the private key sits on your client and the public key is in
discoverable by the other end.

Most enterprises (including Mozilla) take the stance that key management on
the client is beyond the average user.  The notable exception is twitter
who are rolling out 2 factor auth based on PKI.

If you're interested in signing stuff with RSA (or other) keys, the web
payments and payswarm guys have done a ton of work on this, including
implementations, which you may be able to reuse ...
