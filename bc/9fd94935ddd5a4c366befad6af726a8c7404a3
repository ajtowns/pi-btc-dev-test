So how about we say two months? That way it's easy for merchants to comply
with the EU DSD and we keep RAM usage in check until we come up with a more
sophisticated refund scheme.

There's another issue with BIP 70 and refunds that I noticed. The
PaymentRequest doesn't specify whether refunds are possible. So wallets
have to either never submit refund data, or always submit it even if it
makes no sense. Because setting things up to get refunds has a non-zero
cost for the sender, it'd help if we could optimise it away for merchants
that simply refuse to issue refunds for whatever reason.
