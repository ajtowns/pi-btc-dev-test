Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Ok to use 0.8.x?
Message-ID: <CAD2Ti28XnZFDLMm+B1cxb5b+adjwk5M-DrFRs7C+VE=SLZ0hNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Assuming a new install and first time connection to the net,
is using 0.8.x [1] safe to use, for all (or select?) purposes,
regarding the current fork issue?

If not, is there a recommended branch, tag, or commit, for
all such (or select?) purposes, until such time as an upgrade
alert is broadcasted?

Thanks.

[1] Regarding possible 0.8.x flavors...

There are only 'branch master' and 'tag v0.8.0' here:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin

There are no 0.8.x branch or tags here yet:
