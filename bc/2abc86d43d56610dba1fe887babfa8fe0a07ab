Interesting, I just mentioned namecoin literally seconds before this email arrived.
Saying "it did not catch" is not accurate I'd say. It still works great, and namecoin
has actually made great progress this year 2017. I'd say that namecoin has great potential
but just not widely adopted yet.

Would be real nice to have namecion support in major bitcoin wallets for name to data mapping.
