Write coalescing works fine when you have multiple writes headed to the same 
(contiguous) location.  Will lightning be useful when we have more unique 
transactions being sent to different addresses, and not just multiple 
transactions between the same sender and address?  I have doubts.

Sure we can work incrementally and carefully, and this is exactly what
Bitcoin has been doing, and *must* do for safety and security for the
last 5 years!
That doesnt mean that useful serious improvements have not been made.

I think you misunderstand how lightning works.  Every lightning
transaction *is* a valid bitcoin transaction that could be posted to
the Bitcoin network to reclaim funds if a hub went permanently
offline.  It is just that while the hubs involved remain in service,
there is no need to do so.  This is why it has been described as a
(write coalescing) write cache layer for Bitcoin.>

I believe people expect lightning to be peer 2 peer like bitcoin.
