It's a problem if you work with iterators to deserialize the byte stream. Even failing that, it's just sloppy programming. What happens in the future when new fields are added to the version message? It's not a big deal to say that this protocol version has X number of fields, that (higher) protocol version message has X + N number of fields. Deterministic number of fields per protocol version is sensical and how Bitcoin has been for a long time.

And yes, it was a problem for me that caused a lot of confusion why this byte didn't exist in many version messages despite the standard saying it should and the code in bitcoind indicating it should. Nowhere was this written. It doesn't help other implementations to have an unclear behaviour that depends on some magic from one implementation.

It has to be optional because old clients don't send it, obviously.

Why is this even an issue? There's no problem with variable length messages in any codebase that I'm aware of. Is this solving some actual problem?

That's me. I never said to make all messages fixed length. I said to make a fixed number of fields per protocol. So given a protocol version number, you know the number of fields in a message. This is not only easier for parsing messages, but just good practice. I don't see why a 1 byte flag needs to be optional anyway.
