There's three that immediately come to mind:

Gregory Maxwell has proposed it as a way of discouraging miners from
reorging chains, by including some of the low-order bits of a previous
block header in nSequence.

A few people have proposed implementing proof-of-stake blocksize voting
with nSequence.

Well, a few low-order bits, if you want to use RCLTV functionality; pure
RCLTV would save a lot more bits.

Indeed! But lets make sure we have a good argument in the BIP.
