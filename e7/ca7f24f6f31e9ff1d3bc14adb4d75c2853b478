Subject: [Bitcoin-development] [PROPOSAL] Merkle tree of unspent
 transactions (MTUT),
 for serverless thin clients and self-verifiable prunned blockchain.
Message-ID: <CAE98tO0Nh=L2mSy-MzEW7o+0=Tzivw0zj8cG8e1EscmW0C0kBg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've written this proposal. C&P of the overview:

Satoshi's original paper describes a way of prunning spent
transactions in the blockchain to save storage space while it remains
consistent and verifiable, but it's useless for partial blockchain
downloads: while you can know if a given transaction is in the
blockchain, you can't know if it has been spent in a subsequent
transaction.
This proposal describes how to add a hash-tree based check in the
blockchain that allows to verify if a transaction is unspent without
downloading and checking all the blockchain. The idea is not new, but
at the time of this writing there isn't any technical description of
how this should be done. Aditionally, this solution is rather simple.
