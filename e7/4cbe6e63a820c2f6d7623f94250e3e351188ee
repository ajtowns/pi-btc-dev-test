One possibility would be to create a peer sourced green address
implementation. That is, each user could, individually decide to trust
certain addresses as "green" and optionally, publish this trust. Basing
things on the published trust, you could dynamically, as opposed to
static hierarchies, evaluate the trustworthiness of each green address
you haven't personally decided to trust.

This would be somewhat involved implementation, though, as it would
require heavy statistical calculations.
