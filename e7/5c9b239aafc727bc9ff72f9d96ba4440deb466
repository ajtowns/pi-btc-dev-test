You seem to be analysing a different attack - I mean that if someone
has enough hashrate to do a selfish mining attack, then setting up a
system that has no means to reduce block-size risks that at a point
where there is excess block-size they can use that free transaction
space to amplify selfish mining instead of collecting transaction
fees.
