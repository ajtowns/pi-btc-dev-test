Miners signalling they have upgraded by flipping a bit in the nVersion
field has little relevance in a hard fork. If 100% of the hash power
indicates they are running this proposal, but the nodes don't upgrade, what
will happen?

For the record, I actually talk a lot about hard forks with various
developers and am very interested in the research that Johnson in
particular is pioneering. However, I have failed to understand your point
about 95% miner signalling in relation to a hard fork, so I am eagerly
awaiting your explanation.
