Looks like only about ~30% disk space savings so I see your point. Is there
a critical reason why blocks couldn't be formed into "superblocks" that are
chained together and nodes could serve a specific superblock, which could
be pieced together from different nodes to get the full blockchain? This
would allow participants with limited resources to serve full portions of
the blockchain rather than limited pieces of the entire blockchain.
