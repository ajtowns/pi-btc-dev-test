Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Time for a 0.8.2 release
Message-ID: <CABsx9T3ZYVosuL9MKpuK_5fJb01Yj-zBS0YGmdA-Jo4L3UHzhA@mail.gmail.com>

Consensus in #bitcoin-dev chat is that it is time to do a 0.8.2 release. A
few important bugs have been fixed, and the goal will be to get a 0.8.2
final release before the May 15'th hard fork deadline.

Pieter has already started going through the issues list; help with
testing, debugging, and fixing high-priority issues is very welcome. I'll
also be going through the issues list and marking any issues I think need
to be fixed with the '0.8.2' milestone.

If translation work needs to be done, now is a great time to do it.

We still don't have a basic QA checklist for testing of release candidates;
I'll commit to spending a little of the remaining "Bitcoin Testing Project"
bitcoins to whoever contributes to creating one.
