Hey guys,

With all the recent congestion and discussion regarding FSS-RBF, I was wondering if there good reasons not to have CPFP as a default policy? Or is it?

I was also wondering, with CPFP, should the transaction fee be based on total transactions size, or the sum of each transaction?s required fee? For example, a third transaction C whose unconfirmed utxo from transaction B has an unconfirmed utxo in transaction A (all of A?s inputs are confirmed), with each A, B and C being ~300bytes, should C?s transaction fee be 0.0001 btc for the ~1kb it is about to commit to the blockchain, or 0.0003 btc for the 3 transactions it is going to commit.

I tried to test it out a few days ago, sending 0.0008 btc without any fee, then that utxo into another transaction w/ 0.0001 btc. It still hasn?t confirmed, which could be any of: a) CPFP doesn?t have enough hash power, b) the amounts are too small, c) the coins are too new, d) the fee should have actually been 0.0002 btc, e) the congestion is just too great; or some combination.

Just curious as whatnot?

Thanks,
RicMoo
