I?ve been pondering this whole scale issue considerably?and am left with the conclusion that blockchains are ultimately dispute resolution mechanisms. The vast majority of crypto negotiation will be taking place at levels lesser than global consensus in the future - global consensus is just far too expensive to require for every single cappuccino. There really is little need to take most cases globally?unless the participants disagree. I?ve commented in other places that blockchains are essentially a ?fix? to the prisoner?s dilemma - they make cooperation the equilibrium strategy.

Regardless of whatever linear factor we scale the blockchain by, it is simple math to see that any exponential growth (even if for a short time) in usage will overwhelm the current network. If we ever intend to take bitcoin mainstream, we will most likely experience at least a short time of exponential growth?at least until we either reach an inherent limitation or until we saturate. As Pieter said earlier, FAPP right now the demand for payments might as well be infinite. We?re nowhere near the ability to service it all.

The block size issue is really a usability issue at this point. There are two fundamental things we need to solve:

1) There?s no model for how we?ll introduce a fee market, even though the design of Bitcoin fundamentally depends on fees for its survival (at least in the current form of the design.)

2) There?s no mechanism for how to perform fee bidding and estimation. Most wallets simply have no way to do this without serious usability problems.



If we?re going to talk about block fees, let?s keep it in the context of these relevant issues and not confound it with the scalability issue?these are two very different issues.

My experience in markets has lead me to realize that it's never wise to assume I know what "the market" does and doesn't know. If Jeff Garzik is right about what the market has priced in, then yes, filled blocks will be rocking the boat. But who's to say that the smartest, biggest investors and traders don't already see this scaling problem, and have already priced it in? In this case, a sudden large increase in the block size is actually rocking the boat. The point is, you can't know either way, so trying to pre-empt the market in this way is erroneous.
