Yes. I think this limitation could be removed.
A responding node can have ? in theory ? multiple identity-keys per
network interface (network interfaces is also confusing, because you
could run multiple bitcoind instances on the same interface with
different ports).

The BIP should just make clear, that it is probably wise, to use
different identity-keys for each network interface (ipv4, v6, tor).

I'll try to overhaul that part.
