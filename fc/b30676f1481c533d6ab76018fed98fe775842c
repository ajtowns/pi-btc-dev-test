It's still worse than doubling the block size, which was your main argument.

So yes, better relay protocols (whether you consider "SPV mining" a form of
that or not) reduce the effect of the block size. That does not give any
benefit for reduced interblock times.

Your argument seems to be "centralization pressure is not bad now, because
it already improved a lot... so we can make it worse again by reducing
interblock time"? I disagree that it is not bad, and shorter blocks have
other downsides which were already mentioned.

compatible. We can talk for hours and hours and we won't prevent miners
from doing it. I predicted it back in 2013, without even being a miner
myself. It's here to stay. Forever. It's a pity Greg chose that awful name
of "SPV" mining instead some cool name like "Instant" mining that we could
market as Bitcoin latest feature :)

The SPV security assumption is that no hashrate majority will collude in
order to make my transactions incorrectly look confirmed.

With validation-less mining, even a 0.1% hashrate that is part of a group
with 60% hashrate is enough to make that happen.

Of course they won't intentionally do that. No other miner would agree to
do validation-less mining with them again, making it harder for them to
compete. So it is not permissionless: you get higher profitability by
making an agreement with the largest hashrate. I think that is a much worse
centralization effect than having an optional centralized relay network
available... there could even be multiple such networks.

if I don't know you, I know you wouldn't waste 25 BTC to try to cheat me
for 25 BTC with a probability of 1/100, that's for sure. On average, you
loose 24.75 BTC per cheat attempt.

Per cheat attempt, or per bug.

incentives. SPV mining also must be there to prevent malicious actors from
DoS-ing the relay network. If it's there, then the DoS incentive disappears.

I thought about this too. Since headers-first it would be trivial to do: if
our best header is ahead of our best block, hand out an empty template in
createblocktemplate, and we're done.

Unfortunately, Greg Maxwell pointed out that this (even with a time limit)
amplifies selfish mining, since I can propagate headers before propagating
blocks, in order to make others temporarily work on top of my chain.

> Also as Michael Rudy points out, higher block rate means lower variance,
and that's good for miners. Last, as I already said, having a lower average
block interval strengthens Bitcoin value proposition, so miners would be
delighted that their bitcoins are more worthy.

Only a small constant factor, but yes.
