Containing what?  I'm not aware of any security considerations that are any
different from any other consensus rules change.

(I can write a blog post summarizing our slack discussion of SPV security
immediately after the first greater-than-1mb-block if you like).

That testing is happening by the exchange, library, wallet, etc providers
themselves. There is a list on the Classic home page:

The only voting in this BIP is done by the miners, and that cannot be faked.

Are you talking about people spinning up pseudo-full-nodes that fake the
user-agent?

As I said, there are people who have said they will spin up thousands of
full nodes to help prevent possible Sybil attacks which would become
marginally easier to accomplish immediately after the first >1mb block was
produced and full nodes that hadn't upgraded were left behind.

Would Blockstream be willing to help out by running a dozen or two extra
full nodes?

I can't imagine any even-remotely-likely sequence of events that would
require a rollback, can you be more specific about what you are imagining?
Miners suddenly getting cold feet?

I don't plan to monitor or manage anything; the Bitcoin network is
self-monitoring and self-managing. Services like statoshi.info will do the
monitoring, and miners and people and businesses will manage the network,
as they do every day.
