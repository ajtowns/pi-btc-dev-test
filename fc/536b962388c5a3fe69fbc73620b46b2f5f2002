This is a great solution.

8 or more secure hashes, each of which can be implemented on GPU/CPU, but
rotate through them - per block round robin.

Hardware, infrastructue investment is protected.  ASIC is not.

Each pow has different tracking metrics and difficulty adjustments.  This
means the difficulty adjust will be less accurate (1/8th the samples),  but
that's never been an issue.

ASIC will never beat this - because it will be 8x more expensive to
maintain the cold circuits.

Miners with gpu/generalized hardware will always be in business.

Should be done gradually and pre-emptively.    Change one at a time on a
slow schedule, allowing a graceful transition.
