Criticism accepted, although I'd appreciate it if you supply some reasons
about why it's such a bad idea :-)
The idea was never really popular and before starting work on a real
implementation I wanted to test the water, and should it turn out it's
complete non-sense I'm happy to accept that.

I don't want to have a DHT for the DHTs sake, I was more interested in
reducing the number of messages that need to be sent around the network,
since network load is going to be a major problem if we ever grow beyond a
certain point.

Just wanting to brainstorm.

Regards,
Chris
