Yes, as I said in the github topic
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4351) I suggest we adapt a
string-based name space for extensions.

A new network version could add a command 'getextensions' to query the
supported extensions, returning a list of extension strings or
(extension,version) pairs. For BIPs some something like 'BIP0064'
could be defined, but for an experiment for example
'experimental-getutxo'. This would be easy to implement and specify.

Unlike with the 64 service bits it does not require (as much) central
coordination to assign as there is no real danger of collisions. It
takes the political aspect out of P2P network extensions, and gives
more freedom to alternative implementations to experiment with their
own extensions. And no more need for bitcoin core to drive what must
be supported with increasing network versions.
