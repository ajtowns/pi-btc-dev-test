Thanks for the reply. My understanding is that the bitcoin relay network is
a backbone of connected high speed servers to increase the rate at which
transactions and new blocks propagate - and remove a number of delays in
processing. But it would still require the miners to download the entire
block before building on top of it with any degree of confidence. With a
tweak to only send the required information for other miners to build on
top of that block, this is a step towards what we propose, yet would
require trust that the header information sent is accurate. The bitcoin
relay network website states that blocks are not fully verified and should
be checked by the miners before building on top of them.

What we propose is more complex (granted!), yet that complexity serves a
purpose. We reduce (and hopefully eliminate) the adverse incentive to
entice miners to build on inaccurate data. This is achieved by making the
financial losses of fake messages outweigh the financial gains of such
attack vectors. It could also help in the block size debate if this
proposed solution would eliminate the disadvantages of large blocks.
