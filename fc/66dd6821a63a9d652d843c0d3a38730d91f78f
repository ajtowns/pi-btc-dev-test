I can substantiate Gavin's point quite powerfully: a couple months ago I 
did a search for the "hardest" block in the network and found a *very 
**impressive* one:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=29675.0

That block has a difficulty of **36 billion** when the network had a 
difficulty of **1.5 million**, which is 24,000 times harder than the 
target.  If we were going by the /actual /hardest chain instead 
target-based-hardest chain, /then this block produced in July would 
might still represent the longest chain!/

Yes, that means that whichever miner produced this block, could've held 
onto it for 2-4 months without doing anything else, and then broadcast 
it to fork the blockchain from a block produced months ago.  That's not 
theoretical, that's real data in the blockchain and it would be a disaster.
