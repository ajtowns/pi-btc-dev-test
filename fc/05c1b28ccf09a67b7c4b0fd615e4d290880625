Well, I was assuming they just can't upgrade their connection (without
moving thei operations to another place). Maybe that assumption is
ridiculous as well.

No, I'm not suggesting that.

> So: what is your specific proposal for minimum requirements for
connectivity to run a full node? The 20MB number comes from estimating
costs to run a full node, and as my back-and-forth to Chang Wung shows, the
costs are not excessive.

Well, you were I think assuming a new desktop connecting from somewhere in
the US. I would be more confortable with an eee pc from a hotel in India,
for example. But yeah, targeting some concrete minimum specs seems like the
right approach for deciding "how far to go when increasing centralization".

But "hitting the limit will be chaos" seems to imply that completely
removing the consensus maximum blocksize is the only logical solution. What
happens when we hit the limit next time? When do we stop kicking the can
down the road? When do we voluntarily get that "chaos"?
Again, "that's too far away in the future to worry about it" is not a very
conving answer to me.
