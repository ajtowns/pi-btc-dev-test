accordingly to public release[1], They.

1. agreed that blocksize increase is needed.
2. opposed original 20mb, suggest 8mb instead as it is more technically
reasonable.
3. do not want blocksize to change in the "short term future" ( direct
translation. ) and in the document states.
"after discussion we are in agreement that the blocksize should be within
the ball park of 8mb for the short term future."

They have no explicitly rejected or supported the other components of
BIP101. It's my opinion that as long as the change is < 8mb. they'll take
it.

I don't believe in trying to predict the future, on adoption, technology
growth, nor geopolitics. I think it matters very little which BIP we need
up deploying, as long as all the attack vectors are covered, especially for
the dynamically adjustable ones.

One thing is for sure though, not increasing the blocksize is not an option.

we can't predict the future, in the mean time, Hardfork Responsibly?.
