I think it might be ok to use proof-of-stake on as an anti-sybil scheme 
on tor.. people would obviously not want to associate their wallet with 
their IP address, but is there any harm in associating it with a 
(temporary) tor service id (especially one that isn't used for anything 
other than relaying bitcoin transactions)? If each node you connect too 
can sign some challenge with a key that controls some BTC (and your 
client node verifies that the funds are different) then that might be 
useful.. even if it were only a small 0.01BTC stake that would be 
similar to the cost of obtaining another IP through a cheap VPS or VPN 
and significantly higher than the cost to an attacker who is able to 
MITM everything and operate on any IP anyway.
