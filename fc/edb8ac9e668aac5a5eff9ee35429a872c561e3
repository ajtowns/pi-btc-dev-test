UI would obviously still have RPC functionality with -server. I don't mean
dropping that. The UI links both the UI and the network code (for now, until
this is separated out and the preferred UI<->core communication method is
through RPC).

I just mean that the *headless* daemon is separate from the UI executable,
which is the case for any other sane client/server-based program in
existence, from bittorrent nodes to game servers.

It would also make it possible to build the command line RPC client
(bitcoin-cl) *without* building the server or UI. Useful if you want to
remotely control a Bitcoin daemon but not want to build it locally.
