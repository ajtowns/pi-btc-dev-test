Hi,

You may have a look at the following proposal. It associates
generations txouts with the appropriate addresses and accounts.
(See my previous mail)

Either this, or maybe webservices should be told to forget about
categories and to rely only on the sign of the amounts. Maybe a "type"
field with values "credit"/"debit" could help them? This way, more
categories could be added later (escrow transactions, or other scripts
that might be standardized).

An official API guide (not just a technical reference) would be very
valuable here.

Last, I agree that {list,get}receivedby* should include generated
amounts, because there is currently no way to do this for
generations. (This issue is not addressed by my patch yet)

Best,
St?phane
