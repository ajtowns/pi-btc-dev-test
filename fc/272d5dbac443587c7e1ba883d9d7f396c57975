Your example doesn't have an address in it at all, so isn't compatible with
non-BIP70 wallets. Maybe for QRcodes specifically there are no longer any
such wallets out there. For clickable links it can still be an issue.

Can just truncate SHA256, I think.

Their wallet checks the name, though. It sees:

bitcoin:1AbCd?r=https://bitpay.com/r/12345

and the wallet verifies that the presented certificate is for CN=bitpay.com

Well, I wrote an article that argues with this PoV:

No disagreement that it's a more complex mechanism. But seeing as we end up
depending on it anyway the moment you load any kind of web page to find out
the URI, adding another mechanism only increases complexity, it doesn't
remove any.

Sure. But signing is harder than just calculating a hash.


Well, again, it saves qrcode bytes. You don't have to include a dedicated
hash. The existing address hash can double up as both a backwards
compatibility measure, and also an auth mechanism.
