The block size isn?t about scaling but about supply and demand of finite resources. As demand for block space increases, we can address it either by increasing computational resources (block size) or by increasing fees. But to do the former we need a way to offset the increase in cost by making sure that those who contribute said resources have incentive to do so.

I HATE the "it must be this or that" "us or them" attitude, it fosters unproductive bickering and negativity.

Regarding rhetoric, fair enough, Gavin - I?m human and I could be wrong. It is my educated best guess, a conclusion I?ve drawn given my understanding of computer science, economics, and what?s been happening in this space.
