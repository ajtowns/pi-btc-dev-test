Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Anything to chat about today at 21:00 UTC ?
Message-ID: <CABsx9T3t_=BWJ0PvTLTS=oGxVYA1vRTD3t3Wo5D1=jfO6HG-7g@mail.gmail.com>

I'll be in the #bitcoin-development IRC channel in two hours, for the
semi-regular Tuesday IRC meeting. Things that might be worth some
discussion:

+ The duplicate coinbase attack/fix, and strategy for rolling out sipa's
fix.

+ 0.6 release schedule

+ Is there anything we can do to attract a great Windows developer?  (we've
got issues piling up...)

+ Multisignature next-steps: who is working on what?

Am I forgetting anything?
