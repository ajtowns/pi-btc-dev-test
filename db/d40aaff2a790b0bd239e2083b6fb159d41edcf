Who would be the best person to interview who could explain this issue and
workaround/resolution?

I'd like to get an audio segment for the Let's Talk Bitcoin show ASAP, as
this will be a big concern for many users who will not know what to do or
be able to understand the problem.

Any volunteers for a 15 min audio interview in the next 2 days?
