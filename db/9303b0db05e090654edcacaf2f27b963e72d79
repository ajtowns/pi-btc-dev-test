I have trouble seeing how could the real-time anonymous payments market 
can be cleanly separated from everything else.  If trusted third parties 
become the norm for that market, there will inevitably be a huge overlap 
effect on other markets that bitcoin can serve best, even today.  I 
don't see how any currency, any cash, can concede this market.
