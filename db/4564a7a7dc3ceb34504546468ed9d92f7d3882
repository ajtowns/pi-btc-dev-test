Conservative is a relative term. Dropping transactions in a way that is
unpredictable to the sender sounds incredibly drastic to me. I'm suggesting
increasing the blocksize, drastic as it is, is the more conservative
choice. I would recommend that the fork take effect when some specific
large supermajority of the pervious 1000 blocks indicate they have
upgraded, as a safer alternative to a simple flag date, but I'm sure I
wouldn't have to point out that option to people here.
