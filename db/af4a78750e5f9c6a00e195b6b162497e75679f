Practically speaking you cannot unless the technique used is one
carefully selected to make it possible. This proposal isn't such a
scheme I beleieve, however,  and I think I'd strongly prefer that we
BIP standardize a formulation which also has this property.

The paper you want is
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.67.9913

There will soon be a paper coming out from some princeton folks about
refining that and applying it to Bitcoin.

You can use the secret sharing from threshold ecdsa in the
not-super-useful way where you just recombine the private key and
sign... but you can also use it to compute a secret shared signature
and then interpolate back the signature... avoiding the need for any
trusted device in holding the signature.
