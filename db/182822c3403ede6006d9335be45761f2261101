After some off-list discussion about details with wallet developers, it
seems that structure

m/<cointype>'/<account>'/<change>/<n>

fulfill requirements of all wallet developers around, including myTrezor,
Electrum, Multibit, Wallet32 and other software is willing to adapt once
anything will be standardized (i.e. they don't care).

Because I think that everybody told their comments to the topic already and
because it seems that there's quite wide agreement on that, I would like to
close the discussion and finally implement these paths into our software.

Cheers,
Marek
