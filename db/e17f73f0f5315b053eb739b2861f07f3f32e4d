You used 20% as the size of the large miner, with all the small miners
having good connectivity with each other.

That is *not* the scenario we're worried about. The math behind the
issue is that the a miner needs to get their blocks to at least 33% of
hashing power, but more than that is unnecessary and only helps their
competition; you simulated 20%, which is under that threshold. Equally,
why are you assuming the small miner group is well connected to each
other?

You probably didn't get any replies because your experiment is obviously
wrong and misguided, and we're all busy.
