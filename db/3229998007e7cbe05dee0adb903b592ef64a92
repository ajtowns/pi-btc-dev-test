Whatever...let's use the current subsidies, the same argument applies, it's
just 20 + 25 = 45 btc per block for miner B vs 27 btc for miner B.
Miner B would still go out of business, bigger blocks still mean more
mining and validation centralization. The question is how far I we willing
to go with this "scaling by sacrificing decentralization", but the answer
can't be "that's to far away in the future to worry about it, right now as
far as we think we can using orphan rate as the only criterion".
