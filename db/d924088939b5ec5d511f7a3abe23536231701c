This is somewhat weird. Back in 2014, most of icons were listed as
"CC BY-SA" (which is the correct license according to the original
source):
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/31aac02446472ec5bfc4676ab190ec9d37056503/doc/assets-attribution.md

However the current docs list them as "Expat". A mistake?
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/debian/copyright

Also, even the old version lists some icons "based on Stephan Hutchings
Typicons" as "License: MIT", which could be a violation of CC BY-SA if
I'm not mistaken.

Best,
Tim
