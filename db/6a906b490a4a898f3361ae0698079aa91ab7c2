Might be better to have a global flag that indicates when the node
thinks its current with the network (this could have other UI impacts,
like letting the user know if they send and their connectivity looks
non-current), and only enforce this check when the node believes that
its current.

Currency could be
=height>last_checkpoint&&top_timestamp>now()-safe_amount;  with
safe_amount to be high enough that it's very unlikely to be falsely
triggered by an improbably long gap.
