3rd party / web wallets are no longer viable except as means to burn
customers and divulge (or be forced to divulge) their data to
governments and corporations.

Rather than restate what I have already posted on this matter I'll
leave it there. It's time also for those who are managing bitcoin.org
to reconsider what's posted there (the criteria for what's posted there

 - at present the "web wallet" section should be excluded, that is to
say, Removed! from bitcoin.org

 with the possible exception of CoinKite to remain, which has a
reasonable argument for having made such privacy advances as to merit
usage by people (and to remain at bitcoin.org)

Additionally, I see no point in recommending any of the other wallets
except Electrum, Mycelium, Core, and in the hardware side, the ones
that appear (Trezor and HW1).

Furthermore, I believe those of you who are working for Coinbase
customer operations or Bitpay (I will not name names, you know who you
are) should resign from your employment.  I will bring this point up
regularly.  You can easily find employment elsewhere, your skills are
in high demand.
