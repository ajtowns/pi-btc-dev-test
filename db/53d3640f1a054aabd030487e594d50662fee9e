This comes up every few months. I think the problem you are trying to solve
is already solved by SSL client certificates, and if you want to help make
them more widespread the programs you need to upgrade are web browsers and
not Bitcoin wallets. There are certainly bits of infrastructure you could
reuse here and there, like perhaps a TREZOR with a custom firmware
extension for really advanced/keen users, but overall Bitcoin and website
authentication are unrelated problems.
