That is a subjective matter. To me it makes PERFECT SENSE that funds
across accounts NEVER MIX. One can still send funds from one account to
another and then perform another spend.

That's what I consider a consistent and thus GOOD user experience.
What's the purpose of Accounts if wallet mixes coins among them anyway?

I know it's not good to use classic bank accounts as analogy, but that's
exactly how they work. Or have you every done ONE transaction from two
bank accounts simultaneously?
