This is very useful information but from my experience it is not viable to
have a full node running full time on a desktop system i.e sharing the
system with a normal desktop workload.

With a very powerful "Desktop" machine bitcoin-qt dominates CPU/GPU
resources. Surely the majority of nodes NOT running open ports are being
run on desktop systems.  It's likely that the vast majority of the
"normal/desktop" user base are not going to setup dedicated machines to
run a full node full time.

It's likely that the vast majority of full nodes that are not running open
ports are used occasionally when the user wants to make a transaction or
"catch up" with the blockchain.

That creates a divide between those who do have the resources to
contribute to the system on a full time basis (minority) and those who do
not (majority).

Does the power of p2p decentralization lie with the vast majority or the
"wealthy" resource rich minority?

How will the move to 2MB hard fork affect the vast majority of nodes?

For example Debian unstable currently provides the following:

apt-cache  madison bitcoin-qt
bitcoin-qt |   0.11.2-1 | http://ftp.lug.ro/debian/ unstable/main amd64
Packages
   bitcoin |   0.11.2-1 | http://ftp.lug.ro/debian/ unstable/main Sources


The rollout affect of the hard fork on the entire bitcoin ecosystem is a
difficult process to plan in advance. It's not viable to simply rely on
press releases to encourage users to upgrade their nodes. The debacle with
Pulse Audio during the mid 2000's should be a lesson for those who seek
that route.

Compare that to the requirements for spinning up "bitcoin-2.0" and
enabling users to move their wallets to the new blockchain at their
leisure.

The ecosystem doesn't suffer from instant degradation. Bitcoin "brand"
loyalty will ensure that users who want to move forward with the economic
potential of the 2MB blocksize will be able to keep their existing funds
safe while testing the waters with the new blocksize.

After all Bitcoin is still the only game in town when it comes to scale
and proven history of financial return.

As the new blockchain builds momentum the old one will eventually become
obsolete. However it may also become the digital equivalency of Silver and
that is also a useful, profitable and viable alternative with a proven
history of success.
