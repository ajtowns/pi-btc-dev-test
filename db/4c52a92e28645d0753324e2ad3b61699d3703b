Bitcrust separates script validation (base load, when transaction come
in) from order validation (peak load, when blocks come in).

For script validation it would obviously need the ~2GB (or I think
~1.5GB) of outputs needed to validate these.  For order validation it
needs ~200mb or the spent-index (for bit-lookups) and I would guess
roughly ~500mb of the spent-tree (for scanning), though I don't think
the 5.7GB full spend tree isn't worth pruning anytime soon.

Then it is currently using a  ~1.5GB   index for transaction hash to
fileptr lookups, though this could be made more space efficient.
