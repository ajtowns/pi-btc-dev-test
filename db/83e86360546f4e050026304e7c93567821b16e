Since I'm using "30 days after 75% miner support", the actual deployment 
period will be longer than 30 days. Anyway, if all major exchanges and 
merchants agree to upgrade, people are forced to upgrade immediately or 
they will follow a worthless chain.

Since the block reward is miners' major income source, no rational miner 
would create mega blocks unless the fee could cover the extra orphaning 
risk. Blocks were not constantly full until recent months, and many 
miners are still keeping the 750kB soft limit. This strongly suggests 
that we won't have 4MB blocks now even Satoshi set a 8MB limit.

I don't have the data now but I believe the Satoshi Dice model failed 
not primarily due to the 1MB cap, but the raise in BTC/USD rate. Since 
minting reward is a fixed value in BTC, the tx fee must also be valued 
in BTC as it is primarily for compensating the extra orphaning risk. As 
the BTC/USD rate increases, the tx fee measured in USD would also 
increase, making micro-payment (measured in USD) unsustainable.

We might have less full nodes, but it was Satoshi's original plan: "At 
first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows 
beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists 
with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need 
to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node." Theoretically, we only require one honest full node to 
prove wrongdoing on the blockchain and tell every SPV nodes to blacklist 
the invalid chain.

I think SPV mining exists long before the 1MB block became full, and I 
don't think we could stop this trend by artificially suppressing the 
block size. Miners should just do it properly, e.g. stop mining until 
the grandparent block is verified, which would make sure an invalid fork 
won't grow beyond 2 blocks.

If we could have a longer initial ramp up period, we may adopt a slower 
long term parameter. I think we should at least restore the original 
32MB limit in a reasonable time frame, say 6-8 years, instead of 20 
years in your proposal. If you believe Bitcoin should become a global 
settlement network, 32MB would be the very minimum as that is only 75% 
of current SWIFT traffic.
