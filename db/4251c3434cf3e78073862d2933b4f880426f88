After a little more though (and some comments from aj), I realize that the opcode naming convention is actually CHECK <condition > VERIFY.

Therefore, the full opcode name should be CHECKRELATIVELOCKTIMEVERIFY.

However, this name is ridiculously long, so at least some part will require abbreviation.

In typical script example usage, most sensible seems to be to abbreviate both CLTV and CRLTV.
