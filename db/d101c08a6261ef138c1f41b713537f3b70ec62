I find Peter's proposal relatively mild. I'd prefer that instead of
exchanges going bankrupt, that there be direct blockchain support
for key revocation and 'burning' stolen coins, and an economic 
ecosystem that supports insurance underwriters that pay out when
someone inevitably gets hacked. This would definitely be 'scorched
earth' at one level, but I think would make for a far more
transparent and friendly system.

Most money/payment systems include some method to reverse or undo
payments made in error. In these systems, the longer settlement times
you mention below are a feature, not a bug, and give more time for 
a human to react to errors and system failures.

I see a world in which we have many blockchains, along with not-quite
blockchain things like ripple that approximate that vision you have 
of 'credits'. But we cannot have one chain to rule them all, for there
are inherent engineering trade-offs that one chain can never resolve.

There appear to be some things we will never come to a consensus on, 
such as transaction reversibility, or what the optimal money supply
algorithm is. However we might learn a great deal from sharing code
and ideas. So in that line, see my thoughts on reversibility [3][4]

I'll say the same about not stuffing everthing on top of the same 
blockchain. We might very well have coffee shops that take coffecoin.
But Bitcoin will never be able to scale out horizontally like altcoins
can.
