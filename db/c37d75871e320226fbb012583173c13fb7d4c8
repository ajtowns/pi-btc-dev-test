I have to play dissenter here again..

Using a bitcoin address as a persistent identity key is the first real-world
use of Bitcoin that I can imagine will make it a 'killer app' that everyone
and their grandma will want to use.

If you think 'certificates' are a good solution, then there is some way in
which we have dramatically divergent goals.

I like distributed, decentralized systems in which anyone can download the 
code and be free to participate in the things they want to securely and 
reliably.

As soon as I hear 'certificate', I see a system in which one must pay at toll
to speak, and which puts the listeners at risk because a certificate issuer
is such a high-value target for malicious attack.

Self-signed certificates are great for techno-wizards, but grandma has no
idea if the self-signed cert was signed by her grandson, or by the hacker
trying to redirect her social security check.

"This is your bitcoin address, it's your money AND your key to log into 
your bank website securely, so don't lose it. If you want our address
protection insurance service that will be $20 per month, and if you do lose
it, we'll fix it. If you keep losing it, then your rates will go up, just 
like car insurance if you keep crashing"
