Jeff I respectively disagree with many of your points, but let me just
point out 2.

Over the last 6 years there may not have been fee pressure, but certainly
there was the expectation that it was going to happen.  Look at all the
work that has been put into fee estimation, why do that work if the
expectation was there would be no fee pressure?

I know you respect Pieter's work, so I don't want to twist your words, but
for the clarity of other people reading these posts, it sounds like you're
accusing Pieter and others of stonewalling size increases and not
participating in planning for them.  Without debate, no one has done more
for this project to make eventual size increases technically feasible than
Pieter.  We only have the privilege of even having this debate as a result
of his work.
