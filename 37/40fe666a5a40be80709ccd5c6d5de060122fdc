Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal to add the bitcoin symbol to Unicode
Message-ID: <CALBHtZzHeDy-6Ar+DWUb8hFG4kJcg9+x4Y=TUEiQr3-rbgannw@mail.gmail.com>

Use of the bitcoin symbol in text is inconvenient, because the bitcoin
symbol isn't in the Unicode standard. To fix this, I've written a proposal
to have the common B-with-vertical-bars bitcoin symbol added to Unicode.
I've successfully proposed a new character for Unicode before, so I'm
familiar with the process and think this has a good chance of succeeding.
The proposal is at http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf

I received a suggestion to run this proposal by the bitcoin-dev group, so I
hope this email is appropriate here. Endorsement by Bitcoin developers will
help the Unicode Committee realize the importance of adding this symbol, so
please let me know if you support this proposal.

Thanks,
Ken
