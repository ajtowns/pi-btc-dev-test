Payment protocol currently supports payments to multi-sig addresses.

In general, almost all wallet software sucks RE multisig.  Just try
any of these actions in Bitcoin-Qt or another wallet:
* obtain a public key you control, given a bitcoin address
* easily share public keys
* easily share partially signed transactions
* build a P2SH multisig address from public keys, reliably.  Right
now, participants have no idea about pubkey order, leading various N
possible P2SH addresses, given a list of public keys.  Reproducing the
P2SH address is harder than it should be.
* track "partially controlled" balance (balance of coins of which you
may sign at least 1 of N)
* support for remote oracles and services that provide 1-of-N signatures
etc.
