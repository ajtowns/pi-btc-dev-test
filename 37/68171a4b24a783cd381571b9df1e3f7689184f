Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Suggestion to remove word from BIP39 English wordlist
Message-ID: <31430A55-57AD-4648-8D6D-DE2A45CC013C@vandermeer.frl>

Hello guys,

After reviewing some bitcoin improvement proposals, I noticed that one of the words that can be found on the BIP39 English wordlist is ?satoshi?. 
I suggest removing this word from the list so it?s less obvious that it?s a bitcoin seed when found by a malicious third party.

Regards, 
Ronald van der Meer
