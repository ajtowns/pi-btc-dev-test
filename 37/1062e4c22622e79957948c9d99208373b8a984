Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Changes for version 0.6 are being pulled into
	HEAD
Message-ID: <CABsx9T3u5onesvWr46ZnKCsYAnxxoLn38PuL6K7RrYqmX8pQHw@mail.gmail.com>

FYI for anybody who doesn't hang out in IRC:

I've been busy pulling patches into git HEAD for a Bitcoin version
0.6, with the goal of having a Release Candidate 1 out in a couple of
weeks.

So if you've done all your Christmas shopping and have time to help
test, code review, etc. now would be the time.
