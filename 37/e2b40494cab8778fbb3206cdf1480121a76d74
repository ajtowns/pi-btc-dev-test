I really like Mark?s suggestion but one concern is that it might tip the needle too far. Currently, there is a private cost to include more transactions, which might be too high, but limit the amount of negative externalities that this creates on other miners. If I am able to create blocks that are very likely to be on the main chain with the maximum number of transactions then this makes imposing negative externalities on other miners less costly. Other nodes that are closely connected to me would experience a positive externality through this as well. Would have do some more thinking here but it seems that there is a balance to strike.

The incentives remain so long as the ratio of the seignorage revenues to transaction fees remain very high. Even though the dollar price does not change that relationship it does mean that Bitcoin becomes more expensive in USD terms as the USD price of Bitcoin rises.

If we want to limit the amount of network time spent on redundant problems it would be best for miners to act on this information? What is the benefit of serialisation? Is it that the miner would consider it more likely to make it into the main chain rather than the block that came second?

I guess it is due to the fact that this is the only way a miner can be certain that none of the transactions have been spent already resulting in an orphan block.
