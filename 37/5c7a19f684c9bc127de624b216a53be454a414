I don't think that's a good idea as it can easily confuse or annoy users
when things move around. The ordering should be preserved as much as
possible so users can remember where they found a client they liked
(e.g. 2nd row, 1st column and screenshot with light and blue colors).
Making them search the entire page is inefficient and will just get
worse once there are many clients on the page (and I think that's the goal).
