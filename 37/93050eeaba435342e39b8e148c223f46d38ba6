The problem is picking which side of the fork you mine on randomly isn't
rational for an individual miner. The time that you heard about a block
is important information: the block you heard about first is more likely
to have propagated to the majority of the hashing power than the one you
learn about second. You're rational incentive is to always mine on the
majority side as that side has the highest probability of no competing
blocks being found when the next block is found. (with the one exception
of the previous block being yours) In addition the next block found will
propagate to the majority of hashing power faster, as that majority
already has the previous block. By suggesting that miners pick randomly
half the time they will be going against their best interests. (if not
the interests of the network as a whole)

On the other hand my near-target broadcast solution gives miners honest
proof of what the majority actually is. Making use of that information
is the economically rational choice even at an individual level. Yet it
still defeats the attack, and it does better in returning the threshold
to the originally assumed 51% level.
