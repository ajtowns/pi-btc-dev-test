Do you have any direct evidence of "miner spam"? If so, please link to a
transaction. Also, what could a miner possibly gain from this?

For resource requirements (bandwidth/disk space), please run the numbers on
the Block75 algorithm and compare with growth rates of both.

By this definition, any transaction which transfers ownership of an asset
(stock certificate, deeds to property, copyrights, etc.) is spam. But these
are legitimate, fee paying transactions. They are not spam. Yes, they're
only moving 0.0001 btc. Some will eventually move to Lightning (or
something like it), but many will not as they are unsuitable for off-chain.

No, it actually gives them less power than they have now. Consider the
two-week recalculation: the result of any attempt to manipulate the block
size (up or down) will only last for two weeks. There's no way for a miner
to profit from this (in fact, they'd lose money this way). The best outcome
they could hope for is a very small increase or decrease for two weeks. So
why would anyone do this?

As soon as such a manipulation ended, Block75 would correct the max block
size back to an appropriate level (defined as: average block 75% full).

We covered this ad nauseum in the other Block75 thread, but basically no
one has been able to come up with a realistic scenario wherein miners would
be motivated to do this *and* there aren't any pools large enough now (nor
have there ever been) to have anything more than a minor and temporary
effect.

If such a scenario actually does exist, please describe it in detail.
