Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Ramping up with bitcoin core engineering?
Message-ID: <CAERNvEQ6vGvf57N3LdiKZduSMWpyTMyptm-_pVE2y+gBeKtq0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

I'm interested in helping out with the development of Bitcoin Core.
I'm used to getting involved with huge projects by starting to write unit
tests (in order to get familiar with the project's tools, infrastructure
etc).

Is there any ramp up process (like for example any documentation) that I
can start with?

Also, if you are a leading a test effort and you need a hand, please 'r' me
:)

Thanks in advance!
