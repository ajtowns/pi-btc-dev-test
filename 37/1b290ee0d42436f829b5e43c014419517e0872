Hi Mike,

You are absolutely right about the synchronize time, it's one of our main frustration points right now and we clearly won't deliver the kind of user experience we want, without fixing this. Actually we were thinking of extending Jeff Garzik's picocoin as time permits, but the plan is far from concrete at the moment.

What you say about trans-piling bitcoinj is _really_ appealing. We discounted Java simply because an OS X JVM is no longer guaranteed, but otherwise bitcoinj is ideal for our purposes. How can we assist or otherwise accelerate such an effort?
