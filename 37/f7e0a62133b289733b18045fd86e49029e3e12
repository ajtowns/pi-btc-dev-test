I've kind of given up getting any consensus about this, or even getting
people to care.

Everyone agrees that a decimal shift would be good, but it's the same
boring shed painting discussion every time on how many decimals. In the end
nothing happens.

I can't really blame Andreas for finally taking action and making the
change to mBTC. People in the community are familiar with mBTC because some
exchanges and price sites used mBTC (at least for a while when >$1000),
also mBTC seems to be catching on on reddit etc.

Moving to muBTC (which in itself would be better because it is the final
unit change ever needed without hardfork) would require more coordinated
education effort.
