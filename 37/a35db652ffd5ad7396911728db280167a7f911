Oh, I see. I misread, thinking you wanted the dev team to have a private key and share the public key, similar to alerts. But each peer would have a public/private key pair and use something akin to ECDH for a symmetric key and transport using a block cipher?

How would you share the public key? If I were a man-in-the-middle, I could intercept the public key, generate my own and pass that along and then decouple the pipe when the other side shares their public key.

Also, you should not ignore your SSH fingerprint, as you exactly open yourself to mitm attacks.
