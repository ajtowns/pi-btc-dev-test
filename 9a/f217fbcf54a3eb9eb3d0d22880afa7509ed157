As noted elsewhere in the thread, there are two problems with this
analysis:

1. It asserts that zero-confirmation transactions are in a binary
state of safe/broken instead of recognizing that relying on them is a
non-binary risk analysis on the part of a merchant.

2. Assumptions about what is profitable for miners are based on all
miners having short time horizons for calculating profits.

In addition, I'll add that there is an assumption that honest actors
can not alter their behavior in response to changing conditions.

Since scorched-earth solutions to problems are apparently acceptable
now, what would stop more honest node operators from patching their
nodes to blacklist any peer that relays replace-by-fee transactions,
and maybe even publish an IP address list of those peers?

Punishing Bitcoin users for not adopting somebody's pet solution to a
problem neither responsible nor ethical.

Child-pays-for-parent allows for stuck transactions to be cleared from
the mempool, and allows recipients of zero-conf transactions to adjust
their risk exposure as much or as little as they like.

It's a solution that gives Bitcoin users more freedom, instead of
trying to coerce them into pre-determined directions.
