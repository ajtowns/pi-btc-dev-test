Why?

It's the raw transaction API and Bitcoin Core wallet. What should be
carefully and loudly documented is the simple advice "Don't use to hold
customer funds; use Bitcoinj or something instead." followed by a
warning that SPV isn't secure enough for a business unless you run your
own full node.

The raw transaction API has no support to handle fees at all.
