Using the same keys across different altcoins seems like an exceedingly bad opsec
practice. Cointype is critical, as well as having a predictable and deterministic
mapping of alt coins to Cointype.

What should I be using for Catcoin, for instance? the CAT symbol all the 
exchanges use, or do we set up a 'registry', or some other mechanism?

I'd venture to guess the altcoin market is, or soon will be larger in US
dollar value trade volume than Bitcoin, so *some* of us are quite bothered
by the wailing and gnashing of teeth that occurs on this list at mere thought
of such heresy.
