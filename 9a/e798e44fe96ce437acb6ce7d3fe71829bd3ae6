It would probably behave as an ever-increasing block size limit. Spam has 
typically filled blocks to the max, and miners have stopped self-enforcing 
reasonable limits.

Probably it should never make it so small that a reasonable generation 
transaction cannot fit. But I'm not sure this needs explicit enforcement.

If you can't trust miners to signal based on the community's consensus, then 
don't use miner signalling at all. Just set a block height it activates.

I doubt you'll get consensus for such a fundamentally broken proposal.
I certainly don't foresee any circumstance where I could reasonably support 
it... The block size limit exists to restrict miners; it makes no sense to put 
it in their control.
