Setting aside all security benefits (which the user can obviously choose to
implement or ignore), a major benefit here is being able to have multiple
wallets use the same blockchain process. I have 3 different bitcoind
processes running on the same server to utilize multiple wallets. Using
them serially isn't an option in my case. Also, peers can run the cheaper
process instead of having the wallet functionality which isn't even used.

On the security front, this doesn't seem to be any less secure and it gives
the user the flexibility to make it as secure as they feel comfortable. If
they want to run them both as the same user with no SELinux or file
protections (this isn't stopping or encouraging that) they're already doing
that now with bitcoind, albeit with possibly a larger attack surface.

Thanks,
