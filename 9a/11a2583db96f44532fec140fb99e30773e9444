OK, that makes sense. I'll modify my proposal this way:

Beginning block X and until block Y the coinbase transaction of
each block MUST contain a BIP-141 segwit commitment

Overt ASICBoost is allowed on the network already. Until a proposal
explicitly blocking overt ASICBoost as a soft fork is activated, this seems
to be better than the current state which is that overt ASICBoost is
allowed, but at a cost to BIP9 signals.
