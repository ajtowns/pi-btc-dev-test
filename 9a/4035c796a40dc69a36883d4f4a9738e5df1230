Hi Martin,

You're on the right lines. Your writeup is pretty similar to the high level
overview given here though:

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_2:_Escrow_and_dispute_mediation

To make 2-of-3 dispute mediation works requires implementing a wallet that
supports it, and the tools mediators need to manage incoming tickets, etc.
The BIP70 extension is probably the smallest part of the project.
