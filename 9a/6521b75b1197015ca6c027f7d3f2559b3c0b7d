Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 32 proposed changes
Message-ID: <CAPg+sBgnW08NWBH0D39qSZRZDn8W4USS6w76MtRNeH1zwfwvkg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

based on some feedback, I've created a pull request with a rewritten
version of BIP 32, hopefully making it more readable:
* Don't reuse the terminology 'public' vs 'private' for the alternate
derivation scheme which doesn't allow computing child public keys from
parent public keys, but call them "hardened".
* Add explicit type conversion functions.
* Don't use the ' suffix to mean "alternate" in two very different
meanings (use the 'h' suffix to mean hardened, and use CKDpriv and
CKDpub for the derivation functions that operate on private and public
keys).
* Several smaller changes.

These are just documentation changes, the semantics are unchanged.

Comments are welcome, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/12.
