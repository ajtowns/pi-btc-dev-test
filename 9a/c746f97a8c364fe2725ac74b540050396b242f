It did happen:

The worst thing is that the proof for such attack is probabilistic, not
deterministic.

A smarter attacker may even pretend to be many small miners, make it
even more difficult or impossible to prove who are attacking.

The only solution is to ask for KYC registration, unless one could 
propose
a cryptographic solution that does not require a consensus fork.
