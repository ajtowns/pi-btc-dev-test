I should add that a strategy of ?let?s avoid fee pressure as much as possible. let?s avoid even thinking about how we?ll transition as much as possible.? strikes me as at least a tad bit myopic.

The vast majority of crypto negotiation will be taking place at levels lesser than global consensus in the future - global consensus is just far too expensive to require for every single cappuccino. There really is little need to take most cases globally?unless the participants disagree. I?ve commented in other places that blockchains are essentially a ?fix? to the prisoner?s dilemma - they make cooperation the equilibrium strategy.

If we ever intend to take bitcoin mainstream, we will most likely experience at least a short time of exponential growth?at least until we either reach an inherent limitation or until we saturate. As Pieter said earlier, FAPP right now the demand for payments might as well be infinite. We?re nowhere near the ability to service it all.

My experience in markets has lead me to realize that it's never wise to assume I know what "the market" does and doesn't know. If Jeff Garzik is right about what the market has priced in, then yes, filled blocks will be rocking the boat. But who's to say that the smartest, biggest investors and traders don't already see this scaling problem, and have already priced it in? In this case, a sudden large increase in the block size is actually rocking the boat. The point is, you can't know either way, so trying to pre-empt the market in this way is erroneous.
