By connecting to some other client, presumably. Have a small hardware
client that is able to do payments via NFC/QR/... directly with a
merchant, and can get 'recharged' by connecting with your desktop
client, for example. Maybe too futuristic to be a concern, but it
nicely illustrates how doing direct sender-to-receiver negotiation can
help decoupling tasks.
