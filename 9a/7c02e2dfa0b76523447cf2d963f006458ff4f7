Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Issue / Pulls timers
Message-ID: <CAL0fb63-zObvzirU1T6-xQnKc4=Ly2go5BBF9Q0XjqAc3o8V7A@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to propose adding timers to the pulls / issues:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/523

"From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; it will be closed after 15
days. This can be avoided by rebasing the commit. Pull requests closed in this
manner will have their corresponding issue labeled stagnant.

Non-bug issues with no commits will be closed after 15 days from their
last activity.
Issues closed in this manner will be labeled stale.

Requests to reopen closed pull requests and/or issues can be submitted to
QA at BitcoinTesting.org. "

This will help cut down on the abandoned / stagnant pulls and issues.
It will also focus attention on priority items, and phase out unwanted changes.

Sidenote: QA at BitcoinTesting.org is working, unlike QA at Bitcoin.org

-Alex
