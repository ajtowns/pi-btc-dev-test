Good catch - I'll write an update soon.

Perhaps we can go further, and include 6 as well? I see zero use cases
for zero-padded numbers, as their interpretation is already identical
to the non-padded case. I wouldn't include 1 (as it would break a
large amount of wallets today), 3 (which may have a use case in more
complex scripts with conditionals) or 7 (the superfluous element
consumed by CHECKMULTISIG could potentially be used for something in
the future).

Ok.

I'll try to reword.
