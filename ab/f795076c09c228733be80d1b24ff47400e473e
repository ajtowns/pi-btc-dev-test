This is definitely a great discussion to have.  Here are some initial,
unprioritized thoughts.  As an engineer, there is never a clear
answer, but a balance of costs and benefits.

Arguments in favor of moving away from Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind for wallet services:
* Bitcoin-Qt is admittedly a very simple wallet.  I see it's core
strengths more as a "P2P router" for the public blockchain data.
* Wallet feature innovation moves more slowly than
Armory/bitcoinj/blockchain.info.
* Requires the full blockchain, which is resource-intensive versus SPV.

Arguments in favor of retaining Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind default:
* More field experience, code review and testing on desktop than others
* Very real possibility of an overall net reduction of full nodes on P2P network

Arguments in favor of multibit default:
* Good user interface, perhaps more friendly for entry level users as
you describe
* Based on bitcoinj, which has field experience and a very large
installed base thanks to Bitcoin Wallet/Schildbach

Arguments against multibit default:
* Less testing, field experience on desktop

I'm sure others can come up with a few more.
