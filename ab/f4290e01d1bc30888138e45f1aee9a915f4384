Curiously enough, at least MtGox's custom implementation stuck with the 
canonical blockchain despite 0.8's accidental rule change.

No, if any other client released diverged from the consensus of all 
past/existing clients, we would do the same thing: call it a formerly unknown 
protocol rule, that this new client has a bug implementing, and be done with 
it.

The only reason this particular issue needs special treatment is because the 
implications of the new rule mean that we're up against a hard limit in the 
protocol today rather than 2 years from now.
