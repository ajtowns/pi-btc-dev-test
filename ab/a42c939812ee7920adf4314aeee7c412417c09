true that.  Though there's nothing stopping a diligent person from
installing bitcoin-core on a dedicated offline machine.  The blockchain
wouldn't need to be synced at all for key generation purposes.

yeah, so I noticed this issue about Paper Wallet generation not being
possible with bitcoin-core exactly because I was recommending to a
non-technical user to use paper wallets, but then I also had to point
out that really bitaddress code should be downloaded, audited, etc,
before use.  Things that are actually impossible for a non-technical user.

So I figured that instead I would make a simple script for them that
would use bitcoin-core to generate the addresses... and that's when it
dawned on me that it won't actually work with present day RPCs that are
all tied to internal wallet.

hence, this proposal.

yes, agreed.
