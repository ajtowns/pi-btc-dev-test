While Peter Todd's public mention on social media was likely meant to be
disparaging, I'll take the contribution of adding 'data mining' to the
title in future updates of the draft - thank you.

It might be ironic that he posted the remark on Twitter, where his message
will be aggregated and sold by twitter to data miners.

Twitter made $48m last year from selling data to data miners, at a 95%
growth rate on year-on-year basis. It has since spent $130m on buying a
data mining business who specialise in understanding how to mine data in
order to grow this part of their business. It is one of their more
profitable sideshows.
