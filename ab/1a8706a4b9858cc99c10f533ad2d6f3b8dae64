Oh ya, forgot this tidbit. Thanks gmaxwell!:

Not mentioned here is that fact that dozens of MTGOX hashed passwords were quietly disclosed on a hash cracking forum on Fri Jun 17, 2011 5:21 am 
(http://forum.insidepro.com/viewtopic.php?t=9124&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=75&sid=1a9e31567fe815c0eea63c40c39fb707 post by "georgeclooney")

Since the overwhelming majority but not all of the hashes match the mtgox database that was posted on this forum (now deleted) and elsewhere I suspect that this post may have been generated from an earlier dump than was disclosed on the forums and everywhere else after the big event.

This appears to be significantly ahead of the prior claimed breach, and is consistent with the great many other mtgox users claiming that their accounts were robbed prior to the big event on Sunday, which I believe would have been too early to be results of the mtgox database leak according to the official timeline re: auditor compromise.

As of now it is thought that most actions attempted to be used will throw permission errors. Once again. This cannot be confirmed at this time. https://mtgox.com/app/webroot/code/admin
