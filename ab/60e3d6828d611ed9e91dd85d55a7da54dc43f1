100% agreed.

To be clear, the current name of the service is Wallet Name Service,
Netki has tended to be tagged to it as people are associating the
service with us.  We also intend to offer more services than just
this, so its actually not really good for us to think of Netki as the
service name.  I have no issues with a neutral name for the lookup
standard.

You are the second person to raise this.  Clearly this is an item that
requires some discussion before anything is decided for sure.  We had
gone this direction (and I assume Riccardo did as well) to provide a
censor resistant option as well as one that would be low cost for
individuals to be able register their own names.  This also allows for
lookups that never leave the local network.  The trade off there for
mobile wallets was one I feel we failed to properly consider.

I think combining formats to use both the two level lookups and tags
could have value.  Tags could include information like versioning, as
well as whether what is being returned is an address, URL for further
lookup, or other piece of information.

I concur with this approach.  I think it makes sense for us to stay in
contact and communication with the IETF side with the hope of ending
up with something that is, in the end the same, or at least
compatible.  I also agree that we shouldn't wait on the IETF to move
ahead ourselves, more stay in communication with them so that we don't
end up accidentally going in opposite directions, and also so we can
learn best practices from each other along the way.

As you can see, this has been our approach up until now where we have
gone ahead and built and expanded our "standard" based on our
discussions and integrations with other industry participants.

Thanks for the feedback!
