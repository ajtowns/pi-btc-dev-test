Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Ready for 0.3.23 release?
Message-ID: <BANLkTikipPm9QU5NRnsKhfN6iF-Ua6duBg@mail.gmail.com>

(cc'd the devs that I'm not sure are on the dev mailing list yet)


Version 0.3.23 doesn't seem to have major issues, and testing has been
unremarkable.  I think we can go ahead and push it out.

ACK for final release of 0.3.23?
