Probably yes. But probably no. Having less hashing power is not good,
and it's unrelated to scalability and decentralization, it's related
to security. Of course we could argue that the hashing power is not
super decentralized at this moment but it's unrelated to the topic.

I'd rather have less decentralized big amount of hashing power as
opposite to less hashing power.

One theory, very close to yours, is that if Bitcoin transactions
demand grows so high that we need the lightning network, there should
be plenty of on chain transactions for miners to collect fees from.

I haven't yet seen the incentives of everyone involved in lightning
network (payment channel end points, hub operators, miners, etc.) but
would it make sense to enforce a % of the fees collected by on payment
hubs to be spent as miner fees, regardless if the transactions from
that hub go on the main chain or not?
