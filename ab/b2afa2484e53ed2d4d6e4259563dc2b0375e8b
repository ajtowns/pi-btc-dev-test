While that may be true I think that's okay -- if it turns out that this is
too conservative, and we succeed in scaling the system so that it's
non-controversial to increase these limits later via another hard fork, we
would still be free to do so.

It seems to me that everyone who has been arguing recently to increase the
block size limit ought to find this proposal to be a strict improvement
over where we are now, and this proposal seems like it's reasonably likely
to be non-controversial enough to be worth proposing as a hard fork in
Bitcoin Core -- thank you Pieter for putting this together.

For my part, I'd give this a concept ACK, pending hearing further thoughts
from others.
