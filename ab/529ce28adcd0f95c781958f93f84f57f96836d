A minor nitpick:  It is well known that the Bitcoin core developers
are some of the most active TypeScript coders around,
E.g. http://osrc.dfm.io/sipa  and http://osrc.dfm.io/gavinandresen

But I think this is an important step forward: Seminal alternative
crypto-currencies such as SolidCoin showed us that economic parameters
can be freely changed at any time, for any (or no) reason at all; and
so we should take this opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to
adopting innovative features like non-inflation regardless of their
origins in other crypto-currencies.
