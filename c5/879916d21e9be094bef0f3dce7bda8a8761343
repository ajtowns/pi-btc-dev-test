Then you have my apology, I will not claim to be any kind of advocate or user of Bitcoin Cash but *had* understood that segwith had been enabled. Clearly my mistake.

You do realize that segwit includes many improvements of which are unrelated to scaling? These same improvements of which
simply increasing the blocksize alone would not fix or enable. Segwit is not just a blocksize increase.
Bitcoin Cash, while increasing the blocksize directly, from my understanding has yet to implement the
improvements and capabilities that segwit enables.

One example being, with transactions hashes being able to be calculated in advanced prior to signing
(due to the signature being in different section than that used
to calculate the transaction ID) it is possible to create transaction trees, enhanced smart contracts, trustless mixing protocols,
micropayment networks, etc...

Segwit also increases the security of signatures.

There are lots of other things segregated witness enables as well.

By saying "..segwit changes alone.... decided to also..." Bitcoin Cash has not implemented segwit. Bitcoin Cash only
increased the blocksize.

that wording above at least from the way I read it, seems to imply that Bitcoin Cash has segwit.
