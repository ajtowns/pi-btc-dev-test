Bitcoin XT isn't technically an implementation of BIP 101.

It's really just an attack on the bitcoin network, not a whole
different than any of a variety of attacks one could perform on the
network.

Facts are as follows.

The published implementation of BIP 101 is shown on the BIP 101 page:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki

at:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki#Implement
ation

The only text in the Implementation section is the following link:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6341

Which is closed by Gavin.

I am wondering why this drama continues, sort of stunned (but not
surprised) by Hearn's XT-hyping, bitcoin-attacking behavior and
crazed, delusional attitude, and hoping that consensus will be reached
on something - by something, I mean one of the following as shown at
http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/ -
well before XT achieves its goals.

By the way, since http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/ doesn't yet
appear to have any developers' signatures on it (except for luke-jr),
I'd like to take a moment to ask the developers if you could please
visit that site and put your signatures to it.  (Thanks to luke-jr for
being the first one.)
