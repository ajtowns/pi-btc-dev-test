Tom, you appear to be misunderstanding how lightning network and
micropayment hub-and-spoke models in general work.

advanced it to the channel (or (2) below applies).  Nothing requires the
payment hub to do this.

On the contrary the funds were advanced by the hub on the creation of the
channel. There is no credit involved. if the funds aren't already available
for Bob to immediately claim his balance, the payment doesn't go through in
the first place.
