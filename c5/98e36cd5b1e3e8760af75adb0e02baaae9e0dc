It really depends on the physical, real world size of the QR code.

If you have a big screen, and security permits displaying a larger QR
code, you can afford more bytes.  If you are displaying a tiny postage
stamp 1-2cm in size, the practical byte limit is very low.

Ideally, you test your QR codes in real world conditions, before
picking the best path.
