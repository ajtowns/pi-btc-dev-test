Can you send me any reference about this? Of course if that solves the
problem, hard fork would not be necessary anymore. I'm just not aware of
any.

Can you help me understand whats taking 40 minutes here? Thats a

To sign transaction with hundreds of inputs on device with limited memory
capabilities, I need to stream all previous transactions into device, for
every signed input.

That means roughly 200^2 transaction verifications for 200 inputs to sign.
Very slow, but does not limit the device for any particular size of signed
transaction.
