It works today and can be used to prove exact size: the key observation is that all you need to show the length and hash of a transaction is the final SHA256 midstate and chunk (max 64 bytes). It also uses the observation that a valid transaction must be at least 60 bytes long for compression (though much of that compression possibility goes away if you're proving something other than "too large").
