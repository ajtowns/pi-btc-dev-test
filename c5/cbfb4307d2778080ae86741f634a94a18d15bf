SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more compact form while maintaining backwards compatibility.  However, a group of users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve  and developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash. Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to simply increase the blocksize. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

My question, the part where it says segwit makes transactions more compact, I thought that transactions are not more compact but rather they just take advantage of extra blockspace beyond that of 1 MB? Yes they would appear to be more compact to un-upgraded nodes due to the witness being stripped, but the transactions are not actually more compact right?

That's absolutely right; this is why segwit is a blocksize increase first and
foremost rather than some kind of transaction size optimization.

It'd be good to get that corrected as well.
