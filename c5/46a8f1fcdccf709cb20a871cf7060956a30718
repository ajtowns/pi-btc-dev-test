If I'm not mistaken that is is nothing new or interesting: You can
delay some transaction by paying more than it offered by every block
you delay it from. E.g. if the next full block would pay 0.8 BTC in
fees, you just need to make transactions paying more than that. But
you'll pay it for each delay and the people you push out only pay once
(when they are successful), so it gets awfully expensive fast.

(Arguably the monopoly price model is better because outbidding party
doesn't need to bloat the chain to do their thing; arguable its
somewhat worse because its harder to do by accident.)

My thought on this was the same as PT's initial: miners and users can
arrange OOB payments (and/or coinjoin rebates) and bypass this. I
don't see why it wouldn't be in their individual best interest to do
so, and if they do that would likely be a centralizing effect.
