You can describe 'A' from a group of A, B, C, D, E as "the group minus B, C, 
D, E", sure - but I don't see how this is relevant?

UTXO storage is indeed consensus critical, as you say, but it is a lot simpler 
to get right than the rest combined. Thus, the end goal is to have a 
libbitcoinconsensus with "the rest", and a (as of yet named) 
libbitcoincompleteconsensus that ties in the canonical UTXO storage. Ideally, 
software should use the latter when it is available, but if there is a strong 
reason to change UTXO storage, one can remain mostly-safe with just the 
former. I'm not sure why this topic is of relevance, though...
