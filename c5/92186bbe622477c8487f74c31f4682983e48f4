Jaromil has his autotools branch rebased against git master, and included Mark's
NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch (needs a commit summary, though).

Can people test this compiles+works on several systems (ubuntu, fedora(?), mingw
crosscompile, osx, ...)?

  See https://github.com/jaromil/bitcoin/commits/autotools3

For me, it works on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, including wx gui.
