Hi Michael,

 Let's talk a little bit more about this awesome stuff!

Well, +1000 for that!! Since bitcoin-qt and bitcoind binaries share a lot
of functions... There is a need for some kind of library, right?! So, both
(and even more apps) can use it!  :)

AWESOME!!

 I'll try to help you here... One thing that I like to try and announce is:

 Use P2Pool with libcoin instead Bitcoin! BUT, to that work, libcoin must
behave EXACTLY like Bitcoin 0.6.0rc5 (at least).

 If it works, I'll update my P2Pool guide here:

 A Complete Guide to P2Pool - Merged Mining (BTC/NMC/DVC/IXC/I0C) plus LTC,
Linux:
 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=62842.0

 I think that this will bring much more eyes to Libcoin!! Don't you think?!

 Let's do it?!?!

COOL!! I just finish my Diaspora test environment, can you try it?!

Too bad... lol

My plan with Diaspora is to include a wallet for each user and, Libcoin
sound perfect for it.

If I use original bitcoind, each Diaspora user will consumes a lot of
resources and I'll need to build a private cloud computing for running
user's wallets more safely...

You know when you log into Diaspora and there is a Cubbi.es app for it?!
So, the same way Cubbi.es manages/shows your pictures within Diaspora, my
(our) application will manage our Bitcoins!! And users will be able to
send/sell Bitcoins between them (maybe integrating it with Bitcoin-OTC will
be a good idea for the future)...
