Hello Praveen

You're absolutely right. We could refer to transactions by the hash that gets signed.

However the way that bitcoin transactions reference each other has already been established to be hash of transaction+signature. Changing this would require a hard fork.

Segwit is the realization that this could be done as a soft fork if we simply extract the signature outside of what the old client considers a transaction. And into a new transaction format where we do exactly what you're describing.

In my opinion the way it originally worked with the sig inside the transaction was simply an oversight by satoshi. No different than a bug.

Cheers
