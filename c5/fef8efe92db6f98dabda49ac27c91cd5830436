I'm working on porting crypto currencies to the semantic web.

The advantages of this is that pages can then become machine readable on
the web allowing new types of innovation and spreading bitcoin information
to a wider audience.

The first step that needs to be done is to create a "vocabulary" for
bitcoin.

What this means is like a dictionary of terms that can be put down in a
machine readable standard (called RDF).

I was wondering if anyone has worked on this before or if there is a human
readable "glossary" for bitcoin that I could take text from?
