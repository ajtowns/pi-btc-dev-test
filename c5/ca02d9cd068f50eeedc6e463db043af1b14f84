I'm not sure how bip102 is less secure than other blocksize proposal
but please let's keep defects specific to each proposal in their own
threads.
In any case, I understand that you agree that 95% confirmation is a
good idea for uncontroversial hardforks (like in uncontroversial
softforks).
I'm not sure if you prefer that to happen before or after the time
threshold, but I guess you're fine with doing it after the threshold
since you didn't complained about that specifically (you can always
clarify your preferences of course).

For instance, they can make their own fork with a new consensus algorithm that requires miners to prove they're attacking the unwanted chain - Garzik's recent 2MB blocks proposal is a hilarious, and probably accidental, example of such a design, with the original Bitcoin protocol rules having the effect of attacking the Garzik 2MB chain.
