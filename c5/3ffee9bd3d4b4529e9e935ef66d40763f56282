And allegations that the project is "run like wikipedia" or "an edit war" are verifyably untrue.
Check the commit history.
How many reverts do you see? How many of those do you see that are not simply to get rid of unexpected bugs, to be re-merged later?

Not much more than two, in ~5500 commit over six years. I feel sorry for you that `getutxos` was rejected in a messy way, still you are so held up about it and keep repeating it as if it is a daily occurence. Disingenuous, at the least.
