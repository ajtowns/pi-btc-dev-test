?That would mean that as usage grew, blocksize could increase, but
confirmation times would also increase (though presumably less than
linearly). That seems like a loss?

If you also let the increase in confirmation time (due to miners finding
harder blocks rather than a reduction in hashpower) then get reflected back
as decreased difficulty, it'd probably be simpler to just dynamically
adjust the max blocksize wouldn't it?

Cheers,
aj?
