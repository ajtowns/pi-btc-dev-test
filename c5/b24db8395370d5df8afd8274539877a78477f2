What came to my mind today, is, implementing a blockchain as a tracker. 
Nothing to do with Bitcoin as such, but with the blockchain 
platform/technology.
I thought about making the blockchain contain all the magnet links and 
developing it independently. But that's another story and I think it has 
no place in this mailing list.
Also, you do realize that the majority of The Pirate Bay's content is 
illegal and shouldn't be discussed here.

You talk about open source, and yet you insist on people doing spam 
transactions in order to access certain content? That's a no-no.
