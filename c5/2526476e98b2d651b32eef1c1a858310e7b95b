Hi All,

I put together a draft describing an idea I had for an alternate set of 
chain mechanics which solve some of the problems I see with existing 
proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems (mining centralization, wealth 
concentration, nothing-at-stake, lack of full-node incentives, etc.). 
I'd love to get feedback on the idea.

Thanks,
