Ups, I forgot that you take the midstate which of course depends on the
version number. So forget everything I said about the version bits. You are
right. But why take the midstate? It can be any hash of the first chunk. So
you probably want to take a hash function that's available in standard
software libraries. And I suppose midstate() is not.
