Few issues I can think of:

1. In its basic form this encourages address reuse. Unless the wildcard can
be constructed such that it can match a whole branch of an HD  wallet.
Although I guess that would tie all those addresses together making HD moot
to begin with.

2. Sounds pretty dangerous during reorgs. Maybe such a transaction should
include a block height which indicates the maximum block that any utxo can
match. With the requirement that the specified block height is at least 100
blocks in the past. Maybe add a minimum block height as well to prevent
unnecessary scanning (with the requirement that at least one utxo must be
in that minimum block).

3. Seems like a nice way to the reduce utxo set. But hard to say how
effective it would really be.
