First, your figures are wrong and also fall out of the sky with no 
justification. Can?t debunk something that is pure garbage.

Second, stating that a bloom filter is a "total loss of privacy" is equally 
baseless and doesn?t need debunking.

I think you just made the case for completely rejecting this proposal based 
on the fact that nobody will use it, BIP37 already exists.

Not sure if I agree with that, improvements are always useful and we should 
be able to come up with replacements.
But arguing against a feature you don?t like, especiallyh one used by 
millions every day, is a sad way to stiffle innovation, Greg.
