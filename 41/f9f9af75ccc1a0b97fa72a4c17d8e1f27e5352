Using the same keys for signing and encryption is generally considered
a bad practice, for a number of reasons.

If the keys aren't the same, there is much less reason to use
something specific to Bitcoin.

Getting all the details right in an encryption implementation is very
difficulty, previously published efforts in Bitcoin software have been
_severely_ flawed and insecure. I am not confident that an effort
right now would receive adequate review.
