I do agree that it is important.

This does require changes to the P2P protocol, as currently there is no way
for a node to signal that they store only part of the block chain. Also,
clients will have to be modified to take this into account. Right now they
are under the assumption that every full node can send them every
(previous) block.

What would this involve?

Do you know of any previous work towards this?
