I agree with Simon's sentiments for question #1, and was actually going to
pose the same question. Non-votes seem like they may poison the well
mathematically, and counting them anyway seems to encourage a lack of
participation at a time when miners really need to be very much involved.
Since we're handing them even more control over the ecosystem with this
BIP, it would be nice to ensure they (all miners) seriously consider their
impact and role on a regular basis.

I'm curious why we couldn't/shouldn't simply drop the non-votes. (There may
be a great reason that I can't think of, but it's eluding me... LOL)

That said, I don't see any issue with counting votes from outside of the
range as the maximum/minimum accordingly (Simon's question #2). In fact,
such votes would be very interesting (worthy of further discussion) if they
begin to lean heavily in either direction.

V/r,
Oliver
