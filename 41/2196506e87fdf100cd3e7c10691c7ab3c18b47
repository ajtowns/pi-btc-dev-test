I think bi-directional sacrifice is probably not needed to assure a close to
1:1 bi-directional peg.

(Bi-directional sacrifice meaning also to convert a zerocoin to a bitcoin
you sacrifice a zerocoin and bitcoin would be modified to accept a zerocoin
sacrifice as a way to replace a previously sacrificed bitcoin).

I say that because if users who want zerocoins can obtain them at 1:1
exchange via sacrifice (a mathematical peg), it is of no additional cost to
them to instead buy them from someone who previously obtained them via
sacrifice for bitcoin (rather than sacrificing a new bitcoin).  So
presumably for goodwill, or nominal fee (a small discount), people would buy
rather than sacrifice where there is availability.
