I've compiled bitcoind with Gavin's DEBUG_LOCKORDER, and fixed two potential
reported deadlock issues (see https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/lockfixes).

No deadlock warnings are given any more, but the issue remains. Just starting up
bitcoin with an empty addr.dat seems enough to cause it every few attempts. 
Is there is locked code that waits for an event that never occurs?
