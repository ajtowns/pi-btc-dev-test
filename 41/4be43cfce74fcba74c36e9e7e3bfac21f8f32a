Unless A1 gets orphaned and B1 gets accepted, in which case all the work 
done on A2 is 'wasted'.

The question is whether there is any 'real' advantage over time for A 
over B.

She mines longer on *a* block which *may* become the valid block, yes.

Then the simple 'fix' would be for the block-acceptance to take into 
account either the total transactions or the total fees, and for the the 
'accepted' block for mining the next block to be the one with the lowest 
hash of one of those values if 2 are released to the network at the same 
time

That is of of course assuming there is really a problem to fix, 
currently I'm not convinced.
