"So desperately needed"? How do you figure? The UTXO set is currently
1.5 GB. What kind of computer these days doesn't have 1.5 GB of
memory? Since you people insist on keeping the blocksize limit at 1MB,
the UTXO set growth is stuck growing at a tiny rate. Most consumer
hardware sold thee days has 8GB or more RAM, it'll take decades before
the UTXO set come close to not fitting into 8 GB of memory.

Maybe 30 or 40 years from not I can see this change being "so
desperately needed" when nodes are falling off because the UTXO set is
to large, but that day is not today.
