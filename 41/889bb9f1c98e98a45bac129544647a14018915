Right.  Well, if I never upgrade to segwit, then there seems little
(zero?) risk of having any segwit tx in my tx chain.

Thus this would be a way I could continue with a lower bandwidth cap and
also keep my coins "untainted", so to speak.

I'm not sure about it for the long run either.  more just something of
an experiment.
