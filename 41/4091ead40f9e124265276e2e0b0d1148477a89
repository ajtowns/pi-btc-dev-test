Thanks for the video! It's always good to see these things in action so
you can start believing in it.

Supporting Bluetooth is optional in the sense that if a wallet should
not support it, you will still receive the transaction via the P2P
network. So I'd say definately go for Bluetooth.

I wonder about the receipt step -- are you generating a PDF on device
and sending it via NFC? This is something that could be supported by the
BIP70 payment protocol. We should try to avoid the second tap, its not
intuitive.

Contactless cards? Last I was to London, the Oyster card was already
contactless. Have there ever been magnet-strip-based Oyster cards?

Neat thought (-:
