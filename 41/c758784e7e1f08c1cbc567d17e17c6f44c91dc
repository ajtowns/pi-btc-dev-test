Great additions! - I was about to do a second iteration of the
calculations including the pool size, but you beat me to it - thanks!

Still the picture remains the same - you can half the fee if you are a
large pool

You second list of numbers is an unlikely extreme:

> k = 1mS/kB

The propagation latency in the network is more due to the block
verification than due to its network (fiber) propagation time,
bringing down the number of hops helps tremendously, so I agree that
we can probably bring down k by a factor of ~10 (k=8-12) if we
consider only pools directly connected. This should bring us close to
break even with the current fee size, but we should really get some
empirical data for interconnected large pools. However - important
note - if you are a 1% miner - don't include transactions!

I don't see a problem of rewarding economy of scale, as long as the
effect is not too grave (raising the min fee would actually make it
more profitable for smaller miners).
