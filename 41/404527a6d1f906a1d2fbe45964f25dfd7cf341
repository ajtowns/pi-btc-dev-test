For the sake of argument, lets assume that somehow (quite unlikely) half the 
mining equipment gets shut off.
The amount of hashes/second is such that it is currently, lets just say, quite 
secure against any takeover.

Your document makes a long series of assumptions about how this can turn out 
bad with each individually is implausible, together are just fiction.

Your research didn't convince me about this being bad somehow. It also 
completely disregards the equilibriums reached by doing so.
