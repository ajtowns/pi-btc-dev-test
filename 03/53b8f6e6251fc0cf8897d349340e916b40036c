I think for now as long as payment processors include the merchant name in
the memo, that's good - as long as hardware devices or second factor
wallets display the memo as well! Trezor has a small screen, I don't know
how feasible displaying the whole memo is there though - hence an interest
in something better. For now we can probably muddle through.

Not really interested in solutions that only help very advanced users.
Besides, my understanding is that most PKI CA's will not sign certs that
include arbitrary data they don't understand for I guess the obvious
security reasons (generally signing things you don't understand is a bad
idea). But I've never actually tried it.

We don't want anyone to have to go back to their CA anyway, especially not
with special requests.
