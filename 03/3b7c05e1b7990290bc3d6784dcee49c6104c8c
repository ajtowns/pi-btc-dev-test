Yes, I understand that. For this reason, I would vote for adding the
usual HTTP authentication/SSL stuff to the REST API. That way, SPV users
can decide to run their own instance of the API (providing the needed
resources themselves).

Or, a trusted party can set up a server. For example, I would be willing
to set it up for users of Bitcoin Wallet. I don't expect shitloads of
paper wallets sweeps for the forseeable future.
