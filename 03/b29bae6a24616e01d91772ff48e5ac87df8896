It all comes down to managing risk. If you?ve got a decent risk model with capped losses and safe recovery mechanisms?and it?s still profitable?it?s fine. But most payment processors and merchants right now probably don?t have particularly good risk models and are making many dangerous assumptions?and probably would not be able to gracefully handle very many risk scenarios.
