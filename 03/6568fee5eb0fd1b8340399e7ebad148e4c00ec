Hi Natanael,

BIP70 exists for seller non-repudiation (i.e. a cryptographically signed
receipt for payment) and establishing strong seller identity in a
face-to-face or other non-web scenario (since TLS doesn't help).
Anything else is incidental.

There's quite a bit that can be done with wallets and web sites, but
personally I'd freak out if my wallet prompted me because I visited a
web site.
