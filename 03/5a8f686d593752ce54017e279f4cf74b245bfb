I can see how merging after the fact could be more practical than appending existing transactions.

I think what Moral Agent suggested is the same as your original proposal, namely dropping rule 3. Only fee per weight unit increase from rule 4 would matter.

The minimum per WU increase could be far higher than the minimum relay fee. The few times I?ve used RBF in practice I increased the fee by at least 50%. Rule 4 could be made more strict. I don?t know what number, if any, would address concerns about relay spam?

This wouldn?t be backward compatible. Does that matter as long as there?s enough nodes that follow the new rules? Is there a punishment for relaying transactions that violate rule 3? Could a recipient using the older rules be mislead (in a way that?s worse than the fact that RBF allows the sender to replace the transaction with anything they want anyway)?

Can you elaborate on this issue?

So this would involve wallets (of users who deposit coins) cooperating with an exchange API to consolidate in-mempool transactions?

And wrote:

theory that if absolute fee went down, the transaction must be smaller and thus
miners could overall earn more from the additional transactions they could fit
into their block. But to do that properly requires considering whether or not
that's actually true in the particular state the mempool as a whole happens to
be in, so I ditched that idea early on for the much simpler criteria of both a
feerate and absolute fee increase.

Why would you need to consider the whole mempool? Let?s say a miner is considering to replace transaction A and B with transaction C, where C pays a higher fee per byte than both A and B. This creates space for ~ one additional transaction in the block. It seems to me the miner only needs to check that the lowest fee per weight transaction > min_fee(A,B). At least in first approximation.

And if you are promising fast payments, you can be stuck in a weird limbo state where you're waiting for the original one to "safely" confirm before it's safe to make a re-payment (even a non-malicious will likely contain the replacement).
