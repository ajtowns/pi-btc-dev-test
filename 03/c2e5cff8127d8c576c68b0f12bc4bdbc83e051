That is correct. But doesn't seem to contradict anything I said.

Assuming it is an uncontroversial hardfork (unlike bip101 in its
current form), miners will eventually upgrade because all users will
eventually upgrade as well.
Softfork-caused forks will live shortly because non-upgraded miners
will build on top of the longest upgraded chain.
In contrast, non-upgraded miners will not build on top of the longest
chain (the upgraded one assuming hashrate majority) and a parallel
chain will be built for some time. This chain can be used to defraud
non-upgraded or SPV users by isolating them and showing them only the
non-upgraded chain, which keeps growing but will eventually be
abandoned.
In the case of a Schism hardfork, some users may never want to
"upgrade" and if there's demand for the "old coins" there will be
miners for the "old chain".

> Sorry Jorge, but I don't think your argument makes sense.

I think my argument makes a lot of sense, it's just that for some
reason you don't think guaranteed eventual consistency has any value
because you are ok with miners abandoning the old rules chain only
eventually (and you don't believe that "eventually" can be far in the
future in practice).

BIP99 doesn't talk about "developer consensus", but rather
"uncontroversial consensus rule changes".
Obviously a patch in which developers steal everybody else's coins
wouldn't be "uncontroversial" even if "developer consensus" is
reached.
We don't need to ignore anyone to consider BIP65 an uncontroversial
softfork: we just need to ignore fallacious and unreasonable
arguments.
As far as I can tell, you are the only person opposing BIP65 (even if
you keep talking about "several people") and I would like to think
that you are aren't being obstinate on purpose only to make your point
about "developer consensus not meaning anything", but you are making
it very hard.

No, you didn't. "Simplified Payment Verification" is section 8 in the
Bitcoin whitepaper that you like to cite so much.

Please study this page carefully and hopefully one day you will stop
using logical fallacies as often as you currently do:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies
In this case you manage to combine ad hominem and appeal to authority
(maybe false authority is more accurate?).
Once again, please, stop using fallacies to try to convince people
that you are right. No offense, but being warned publicly about the
use of logical fallacies so often would be extremely embarrassing to
me.
