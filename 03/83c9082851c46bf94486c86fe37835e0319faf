ACK

We have already started work on Coinjoin simulated transactions and are
very interested in working on an implementation of this proposal with a
view towards making wallet footprints less identifiable.

> The requirement for equal numbers of unique input/output scripts instead

> Restricting the number of outputs to the number of unique input scripts
> prevents this policy from growing the network?s UTXO set. A standard form
> HIT transaction will always have a number of inputs greater than or equal
> to the number of outputs.
>
> The requirement for at least one pair of outputs in an intentional HIT to
> be of equal value results in optimal behavior, and causes intentional HITs
> to resemble unavoidable HITs.

> ==Alternate form heterogenous input script transactions==

> The formation of a standard form HIT is not possible in the following
> cases:
>
> # The HIT is unavoidable, and the user?s wallet contains an insufficient
> number or size of UTXOs to create a standard form HIT.
> # The user wishes to reduce the number of utxos in their wallet, and does
> not have any sets of utxos with identical scripts.
