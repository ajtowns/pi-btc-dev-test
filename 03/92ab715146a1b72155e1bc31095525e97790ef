"Packaged app pages always load locally. This allows apps to be less dependent on the network. Once a user installs an app, they have full control over the app's lifecycle. Apps open and close quickly, and the system can shut apps down at any time to improve performance. Users can fully uninstall apps."

Does this mean that upon install, a nice, icon-emblazoned package will drop into my /Applications folder on a Mac, or in my Windows Start menu, etc... Or are packaged apps always launched and maintained from within Chrome itself?

Provided that the technical stuff could be made to work within the context of the more limited API, this certainly seems like an interesting, user-friendly way to distribute a Bitcoin wallet!
