Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Fix available for startup issues for git HEAD
	nodes
Message-ID: <20131024143403.GB12658@savin>

"DisconnectBlock() : outputs still spent? database corrupted"

If you can't get your node up and running and see the above in your
debug.log there's a potential fix available:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3143

Be warned: highly rushed and poorly tested, so you're best to ask a dev
in IRC for more details.
