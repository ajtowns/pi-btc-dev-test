Run on sentence sorry. I meant to say that development of more efficient/mature mining hardware sooner is desirable to money owners/traders. So anything that could dis-incentivize R&D to mature ASICs would be bad. PoW policy changes should be made carefully in order to minimize this hampering effect.

I didn't mean to imply that Gregory Maxwell's current BIP countered/disabled both the evident and covert versions of asicboost. I think his BIP is a good idea, to quickly release a version that blocks the patented covert optimization... and then later we can consider taking steps to further disable the patented evident version of asicboost if it becomes a problem.

Cheers,
