Or very old, indeed, if you are using unsigned arithmetic. [...]

Hardly,

It isn't, but many people have performed planning around the current
behaviour. The current behaviour has also not shown itself to be
problematic (and we've actually experienced its largest effect already
without incident), and there are arguable benefits like encouraging
investment in mining infrastructure.

This thread is, in my opinion, a waste of time.  It's yet again
another perennial bikeshedding proposal brought up many times since at
least 2011, suggesting random changes for
non-existing(/not-yet-existing) issues.

There is a lot more complexity to the system than the subsidy schedule.
