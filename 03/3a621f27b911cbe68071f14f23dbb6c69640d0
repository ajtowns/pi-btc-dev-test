Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP39 seeds
Message-ID: <68330522-7e7c-c3b4-99a9-1c68ddb56f23@gmail.com>

Has anybody already looked at this: given N randomly chosen words
belonging to a BIP39 2048 words dictionary, what is the probability to
get a "valid" BIP39 seed (ie with the right checksum)?

The result looks (very) surprising to me and might have some use cases,
just would like to know if this topic has already been discussed before
going further
