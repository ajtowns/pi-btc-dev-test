I think the right approach for this is to actually implement it and
*then* propose
a BIP. There are so many possible features we could add to the payment
protocol, any other approach would rapidly turn into lots of people
deciding to do the "fun bits" and often leaving others doing the hard work
with difficult or unworkable specs.

For instance, if you try to implement this, you would rapidly discover that
it probably makes more sense to do this as an additional set of fields in
PaymentDetails rather than a new message type entirely. A new top level
message type would in turn require new MIME types, URI extensions and so
on. That doesn't make any sense.

Once you decide to extend PaymentDetails, the next discovery would be that
it probably makes sense to try and solve the problem of address re-use for
recurring payments first, before speccing out time intervals and so on.
That's a separate BIP.

I'm all for adding recurring payments as a feature, that's what the
protocol is there for. But I'd like to see future protocol extension
requests come after at least one working implementation has been made .....
