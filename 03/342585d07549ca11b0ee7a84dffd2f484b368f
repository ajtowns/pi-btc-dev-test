Of course there is a need. It's the primary mechanism that keeps Bitcoin
secure and immune from malicious influence.

Of course not everyone needs to run a node. But that leaves the
responsibility on us - the community - to help the situation by not making
it too hard to run a node. And I see the block size as the primary way
through which we do that.

If the impact of the system goes us, so should the - joint - incentives to
keep it secure. And I think we're (slowly) failing at that.
