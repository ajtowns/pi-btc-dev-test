Libbitcoin has implemented a 11 + log2(height) limit since version3 for
this reason. This message can be very costly if not constrained.

The presumed protocol inherently limits valid locator size for a given
recipient. IMO it's worth considering instead describing the expected
semantics of the message and thereby its *inherent* limits. Doing so
gives the recipient an upper bound on valid locator size, eliminating
the need to introduce an arbitrary limit.

I have commonly seen locators with 100 elements, I believe from
BitcoinJ. I recall posting a query on the issue to their IRC but got no
response. So it would seem that a quick survey and a limit of 64 would
not have prevented the issue of concern.

But in any case, I agree that implementations should enforce a limit.
