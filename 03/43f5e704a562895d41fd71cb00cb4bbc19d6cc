Following Gavin tagging 0.5rc1, I have tagged the stable git tree "v0.4.1rc1". 
If you are able, please compile and help test.

See the doc/build-*.txt files in the source tree for instructions on 
compiling. Binary releases for at least unix and mac will be available only if 
someone steps up to the task.

There are no major changes from version 0.4.0, only bugfixes.

None of the features from 0.5 are supported, only those in 0.4.

Run: git shortlog --no-merges v0.4.0..
... to get a complete list of changes, and thanks to everybody who is 
contributing!
