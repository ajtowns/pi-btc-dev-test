Arriving slightly late to the discussion, apologies.

Personally I wouldn't have written that patch, but I know development of
hostile patches happens out of sight, and if it can be written, we have
to presume it will be written eventually. I'd have preferred a patch
that only replaced non-final txes, which is the use-case I have for
transaction replacement, but that's easy to add back in.

I'm certainly not terribly convinced of the security of vanilla
zero-confirmation transactions myself, for reasons including but not
limited to this case. I also think it's important to understand that
people do make irrational decisions, and trusting network security on
everyone behaving perfectly rationally is not a workable model either.

TLDR; me too

Ross
