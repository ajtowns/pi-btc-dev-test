Yes, that's fine. If the network cannot handle the transaction volume that
people want to pay for, then the marginal transactions are priced out. That
is true today (otherwise ChangeTip would be operating on-blockchain), and
will be true forever.

"better is better" -- I applaud efforts to fundamentally improve the
scalability of the system, but I am an old, cranky, pragmatic engineer who
has seen that successful companies tackle problems that arise and are
willing to deploy not-so-perfect solutions if they help whatever short-term
problem they're facing.

I think consensus is against you on that point.
