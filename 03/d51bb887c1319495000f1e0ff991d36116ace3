This assumes the states are discernible.  They often aren't cleanly.
You obviously know how bad it is in the best case, but the worst could
be much worse.

I've multiple time seen a hard to exploit issue turn out to be trivial
when you find the right trick, or a minor dos issue turn our to far
more serious.

Simple performance bugs, expertly deployed, can potentially be used to
carve up the network--- miner A and exchange B go in one partition,
everyone else in another.. and doublespend.

And so on.  So while I absolutely do agree that different things
should and can be handled differently, it is not always so clear cut.
It's prudent to treat things as more severe than you know them to be.

In fact, someone pointed out to me a major amplifier of the
utxo-memory attack thing today that Bitcoin Core narrowly dodges which
would have made it very easy to exploit against some users, and which
it seems no one previously considered.

I also think it's somewhat incorrect to call this thread anything
about disclosure, this thread is not about disclosure. Disclosure is
when you tell the vendor.  This thread is about publication and that
has very different implications. Publication is when you're sure
you've told the prospective attackers.
