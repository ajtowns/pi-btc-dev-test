Because the mnemonic is an encoding of a 128-bit random number using its
hash as a private key (or derived part of one) is not a problem, its just an
alternate alphabet encoding of the random private key.

Not being able to generically understand the checksum.  Seems tricky to
solve other than say brute force eg H(mnemonic||1) mod 2^k == 0 where k is
the amount of check digit redundancy.  But that might be expensive for a
trezor if k is very big at all.  And then key = H(mnemonic).
