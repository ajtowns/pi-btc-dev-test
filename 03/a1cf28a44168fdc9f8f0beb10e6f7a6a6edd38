Hi all,

it's a very useful approach to also model fees and you came up with an interesting scenario.
Assuming that you meant that the groups are only connected with a single link,
I've recreated the scenario with Gavin's simulation and got similar results.
The group with the large hashrate does profit overall, but the miners which are not directly
connected to the small group loose:
https://github.com/jonasnick/bitcoin_miningsim/blob/master/analysis/README.md#two-groups-well-connected-internally-but-connected-to-each-other-with-a-single-poor-connection

Moreover, it's important to note that this is not an equilibrium because these miners are better off when they create their own
connections to the small group (see the plot below the other one).
This means that your scenario is not the result of a cartel but the result of a long-term network partition.
When assuming partitions, there are quite a few scenarios where big miners can profit from creating big
blocks. For example, one 40% miner and two groups of three 10% miners, where both groups are connected to the big
miner but they are not connected to each other.

Best,
Jonas
