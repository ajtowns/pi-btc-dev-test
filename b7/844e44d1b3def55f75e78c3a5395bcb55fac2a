Not incentive compatible. Miners would prefer to include transactions
paying fees via alternative mechanisms (anyone can spend outputs,
direct pay to miner outputs, or completely out of band), if they even
paid attention to internal fees at all they would give a lot more
weight to direct payment fees. Users would accordingly pay much lower
fees if they used these alternatives instead of directly, so the
equlibrium state is almost everyone bypassing.   Bypass fee mechenisms
have been supported by miners since 2011 too, so it isn't just
conjecture.
