Can you add a part about SHOULD/MUST warn users if the fee is unusually
high to avoid sob-stories of people sending 20BTC fees with for the
0.002BTC sandwich.

"SHOULD be cryptographically signed" I assume.

Once could make efforts to publish (maybe even as signed commits in the git
repo etc the current valid certificate fingerprints and which CA signed
it). This would go some way to exposing
MITM either by CA or in workplaces where browsers are loaded with bogus CAs
for the purpose
of deep packet inspection.

According to RFC 2119 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt> language, you
might be better using the word RECOMMENDED or MAY over SHOULD here.

Additionally, at the beginning of the spec I would put :

"The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
2119<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>
."
