Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Two Drivechain BIPs
Message-ID: <d3497397-33c3-90c1-1be8-a733736eac0b@gmail.com>

Hello,

First, Drivechain has vaguely escaped vaporware status. If you've ever
thought "I'd like to take a look into Drivechain when there is code",
then now is a pretty good time. (Unfinished items include M1, and M8_V2.)

Also,
Site:? http://www.drivechain.info/
Blank sidechain:

Second, I think drivechain's documentation / BIP-Drafts are tolerably
readable.

Here they are:

1.
https://github.com/drivechain-project/docs/blob/master/bip1-hashrate-escrow.md
2.
https://github.com/drivechain-project/docs/blob/master/bip2-blind-merged-mining.md

cc: Luke, I think they are ready to be assigned formal BIP Numbers.

This is also a request for code review. The most helpful review will
probably take place on GitHub.

Regular review is also welcome. Although, please read our
recently-updated FAQ, at: http://www.drivechain.info/faq .
And also see major earlier discussions:

Have a nice weekend everyone,
Paul
