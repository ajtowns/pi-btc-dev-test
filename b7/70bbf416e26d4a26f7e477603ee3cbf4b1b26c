Please don't confuse people dismissing your thoughts with dismissing the basic 
economic considerations. The fact of the matter is that you didn't read the 
archives where these ideas have been brought forward and discussed, a 
consensus was reached. (it wasn't so basic afterall)

The fact that people don't want to repeat the discussion just for your sake is 
not the same as people not listening to those arguments.
