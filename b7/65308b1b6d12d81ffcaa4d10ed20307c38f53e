Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP for segwit compatibility URIs
Message-ID: <CACUQsLKTHVE7pe=0-zuMTGZWbUaJFp5=CNZCQE0477B7LZRsbg@mail.gmail.com>

An extremely simple BIP write-up for a backward compatible URI scheme to
help with segwit adoption by online stores and merchants.



====

This BIP is a modification of an earlier [[bip-0021.mediawiki|BIP 0021]] by
Nils Schneider and Matt Corallo

==Abstract==
This BIP proposes a URI scheme which allows for backward compatibility with
native segwit (bech32) wallets and legcy wallets (base58)

==Motivation==
The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable all users to easily make
payments from any wallet, without allowing backward compatibility to be a
barrier to segwit adoption. This BIP allows a merchant to preferentially
receive payments to a bech32 address, while gracefully allowing older
clients to make base58 encoded payments.

==Specification==

=== Query Keys ===

*addr: an alternative bitcoin destination which is preferred over the
"bitcoinaddress" field of the url

== Appendix ==

=== Simpler syntax ===

 <nowiki>bitcoin:<address>[?amount=<amount>][?label=<label>][?message=<message>][?addr=<bech32address>]</nowiki>

=== Examples ===

Just the address:
 bitcoin:3BnsWZiTdYVrqiPh2RP3q9Y3ZqvhbCN2it?addr=bc1q5u92yq20hss4rc99mfu23h4dxkxn4uuyqd5dzy&amount=50&label=Luke-Jr&message=Donation%20for%20project%20xyz


== Reference Implementations ==
=== Bitcoin clients ===

* none yet
