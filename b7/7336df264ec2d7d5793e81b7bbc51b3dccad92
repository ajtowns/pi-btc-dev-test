At least on my part, the title of the 1st email was "It's economics & ..."
and focused on (a) economics and (b) transition issues.  There was no
confounding.  There was a list of real problems and risks taken when 1M is
not lifted in the short term.

Thus "SW is orthogonal" in these emails, because these problems remain
regardless of SW or no, as the 1st email outlined.

The 2nd email addresses the specific assertion of "no 1M hard fork needed,
because SW."
