FWIW

That said, keep in mind the github discussion(1) that was had: if all
the DNS seeds being down breaks your application, your application is
broken and insecure. The only exception is initial startup, and even
then you should have fallbacks such as hardcoded node lists and manual
peer entry. If for some reason you really do need instant startup, run
your own centralized high-availability/low-latency nodes; either way
you're depending on a centralized resource.
