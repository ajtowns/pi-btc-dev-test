Java (Applet) security is indeed abysmal but lets compare apples to apples.
With an applet some random guy with a website makes up some Java code and
your browser automatically executes it.
With Multibit you're only executing highly trusted code (so trusted that it
handles your money).
There has almost never been a Java exploit against secure trusted code.

The idea of discouraging use of java apps just because people would be
tricked into activating the browser plugin when installing the JVM is
probably valid but Multibit is the only reasonably complete client outside
of bitcoinqt and I think client diversity is more important than stamping
out java.

Thanks,
Caleb
