Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Process: Status, comments, and copyright licenses
Message-ID: <201602012253.18009.luke@dashjr.org>

I've completed an initial draft of a BIP that provides clarifications on the 
Status field for BIPs, as well as adding the ability for public comments on 
them, and expanding the list of allowable BIP licenses.

https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/bip-biprevised/bip-biprevised.mediawiki

I plan to open discussion of making this BIP an Active status (along with BIP 
123) a month after initial revisions have completed. Please provide any 
objections now, so I can try to address them now and enable consensus to be 
reached.

Thanks,

Luke
