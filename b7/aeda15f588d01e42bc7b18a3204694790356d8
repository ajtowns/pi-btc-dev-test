Is the point is to have different hosts like in jtimon at gmail.com,
jtimon at timon.es, etc. so if jtimon is already taken I can take another
host?

What about reserving directly the string "jtimon at nottaken.org" or
"jtimon::public::receiving::bitcoin" in namecoin?

I'm confused about the problem we're trying to solve.
