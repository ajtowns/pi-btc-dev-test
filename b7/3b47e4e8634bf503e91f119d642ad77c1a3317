I quite liked Wladimir's description of what someone with the ability
to merge pull requests into Bitcoin Core is:

    @orionwl github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin repository admin, or maybe just "janitor"

-https://twitter.com/orionwl/status/563688293737697281

In any case, we can't force people to run Bitcoin Core - an unpopular
patch that fails to reach consensus is a strong sign that it may not get
user acceptance either - so we might as well accept that centralized
authority over the development process isn't going to fly and deal with
the sometimes messy consequences.

Like I said, you're welcome to fork the project and try to get user
acceptance for the fork.
