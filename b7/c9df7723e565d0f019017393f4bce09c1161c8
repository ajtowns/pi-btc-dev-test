It's not just about trust, there is the robustness factor: what if he
becomes sick, unavailable, hit by a bus? Others need the ability to pickup
and run with it. The control over the domain (including ability to renew
registration, alter nameservers) needs to be with more than one person.
That's why I suggest using the same people who have control over the
software project at sf,github.
