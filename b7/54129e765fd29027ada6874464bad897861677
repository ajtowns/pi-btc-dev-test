M = 1,000,000
N = number of "starts"

S(0) = hash(seed) mod M
...
S(n) = hash(S(n-1)) mod M

This generates a sequence of start points.  If the start point is less than
the block height, then it counts as a hit.

The node stores the 50MB of data starting at the block at height S(n).

As the blockchain increases in size, new starts will be less than the block
height.  This means some other runs would be deleted.

A weakness is that it is random with regards to block heights.  Tiny blocks
have the same priority as larger blocks.

0) Blocks are local, in 50MB runs
1) Agreed, nodes should download headers-first (or some other compact way
of finding the highest POW chain)
2) M could be fixed, N and the seed are all that is required.  The seed
doesn't have to be that large.  If 1% of the blockchain is stored, then 16
bits should be sufficient so that every block is covered by seeds.
3) N is likely to be less than 2 bytes and the seed can be 2 bytes
4) A 1% cover of 50GB of blockchain would have 10 starts @ 50MB per run.
That is 10 hashes.  They don't even necessarily need to be crypt hashes
5) Isn't this the same as 3?
6) Every block has the same odds of being included.  There inherently needs
to be an update when a node deletes some info due to exceeding its cap.  N
can be dropped one run at a time.
7) When new starts drop below the tip height, N can be decremented and that
one run is deleted.

There would need to be a special rule to ensure the low height blocks are
covered.  Nodes should keep the first 50MB of blocks with some probability
(10%?)
