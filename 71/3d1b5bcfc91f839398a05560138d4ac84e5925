Hi Gavin (the list escaped the cc...),

I participated also in the hacakathon Sunday @ OnlyOneTV and I felt that this had a strong chance to diverge. So - yes - I agree - no "constitution" changes now. Further, I have thought later on on the analogy of a clerk and a safe.

WHen you enter the bank you hand over your money to the clerk (one key) - then after the clerks wallet has been filled over the day _he_ transfers the money to the safe (3 keys). My point is do we really need the customer to bypass the clerk and have 3 key addresses, or could we just leave it to the/a client to implement the multisign transaction after the money has been received - as a transfer to a safe? This would greatly simplify the problem and cover the vast majority of use cases. Not covered in this is huge single transfers where the intruder of a single key system finds it profitable to reveal their intrusion by grabbing the entire wallet.

Put in another way - do we *really* need to couple the securing of the wallet to creating a new address type ?

Cheers,

M
