I'm already on it, leveraging bitcoinj to do the work. I've added async
capabilities to bitcoinj so that I can peer with everything that will let me
with the goal of publishing quality peer lists via the DNS. Once I can build
some metrics off the network its a matter of creating the visualizations.

I just started on this project last week. Happy to work with others on what
a healty network looks like as well as best ways to communicate status.

also need advise on how to not be an impolite peer.
