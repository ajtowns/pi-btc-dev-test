Hi ZmnSCPxj,

What happens in the case that the provided merkle tree hash has a invalid
transaction in it? Wouldn't this mean that the mainchain nodes would think
the longest work chain is the valid chain, and it would kill off any
consensus valid chain that sidechain miners are trying to construct? It
seems that a malicious miner could extend the chain to whatever the SPV
proof block height is and make it impossible for the chain to reorg after
that. I guess if that is a sufficiently long block waiting period it may
not be a realistic concern, but something to think about any way.

Just a side note -- I think it should be highly recommended that the
coinbase maturity period on the sidechain to be longer than 288 (or
whatever we decide on the parameter). This incentivizes the s:miners to
work together to extend the chain by working with other s:miners (otherwise
they won't be able to claim their bribes). If they do not work together
they will not be able to spend their s:coinbase_tx outputs until they
extend their own sidechain by 288 blocks meaning they need to tie up a
large amount of capital to go rogue on their fork.

Another interesting thing might be to use the OP_WITHDRAWPROOFVERIFY op code
<https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/elements-0.14.1/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1420>
used in the elements project. Since the cannonical merkle root hashes are
included in the mainchain, we can provide a merkle proof to the bitcoin
blockchain to initiate a withdrawl from the sidechain. I wrote up a blog
post on how OP_WPV works here
<https://medium.com/@Chris_Stewart_5/what-can-go-wrong-when-transferring-coins-into-a-sidechain-with-op-withdrawproofverify-b2f49b02ab60>.
This allows us to prove that a transaction occurred on the sidechain to
lock up those funds.
