For Blockcypher to succesfully do what they claim to do they need to
connect to a large % of nodes on the network; that right there is a
sybil attack. It's an approach that uses up connection slots for the
entire network and isn't scalable; if more than a few services were
doing that the Bitcoin network would become significantly less reliable,
at some point collapsing entirely.
