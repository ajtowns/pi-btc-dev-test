Yeah, it's somewhat similar, except that Tor directory authorities are
authenticated (the public keys are in the source code), whereas DNS seeds
aren't. Also Bitcoin puts way more emphasis on decentralisation than Tor
does. For Tor having a P2P network is just something that's needed in order
to build an anonymity network, but it's not actually the goal. For us,
decentralisation is pretty much the end goal.
