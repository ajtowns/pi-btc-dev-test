To what degree is this an actual problem?  If the mutated transaction
pays a feerate at least incremental-relay-fee[1] below the original
transaction, then the original transaction can be rebroadcast as an RBF
replacement of the mutated transaction (unless the mutated version has
been pinned[2]).

  -incrementalrelayfee=<amt>
       Fee rate (in BTC/kB) used to define cost of relay, used for mempool
       limiting and BIP 125 replacement. (default: 0.00001)
