The reason that BIP37 presents a long list of problems is that it is a client-server scenario wedged into a peer-to-peer network. The only possible excuse for this design was implementation shortcut.

As this thread and others demonstrate, reproducing this design flaw will not eliminate the problems. The fact that there are many wallets dependent upon it is an unfortunate consequence of the original sin, but is not likely to last. There is no rationale for node operators to support wallets apart from their own. As a node implementer interested in privacy, security and scalability, I would never waste the time to code BIP37, or and client-server feature into the P2P protocol, especially one that delegates some aspect of validation.

Other nodes (servers) provide independent, securable, client-server interfaces. Many of these are made available as community servers for use at no charge. They could also provide mechanisms for operator payment without polluting the P2P network.

However as a community we should be working toward full node wallets. A secured personal node/server can support remote mobile wallets with security, privacy and no wasted bandwidth. And if we avoid counterproductive increases in blockchain growth rate, full nodes will eventually be able to run on mobile platforms with no difficulty whatsoever. A wallet that delegates full validation to node operators is just another centralization pressure that we do not need.
