Is that what you say to yourself to quiet your conscience at night
(assuming you're one of the non-sociopathic humans who does indeed
have one)? It's "just a nerdy distributed consensus problem"?

The things you're talking about fucking around with have real life
implications for quite a few people and your casual dismissal of this
is precisely why I responded in the way that I did.

What you're doing is reckless endangerment and you're not got to get
away with brushing it off as a mere technical detail.

Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and this episode is demonstrating
to the world exactly how averse you are do that kind of transparency.
