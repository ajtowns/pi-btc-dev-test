Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Mac libboost_thread or thread-mt?
Message-ID: <CAPfzCrQapXWj_qVRffi5Tnr6_e3_0NEXjGnusHiSOkE-RJ5KLw@mail.gmail.com>

I installed boost via the mac ports.  Its got lobboost_thread-mt, but
it doesn't have libboost_thread.a. Should I modify the makefile or get
a different version of boost?
