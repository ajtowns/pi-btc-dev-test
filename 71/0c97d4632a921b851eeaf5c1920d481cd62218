gmaxwell - I wanted to ask you a non-expert question. Let's say I use
my bitcoin-qt on my laptop with Tor, and send some BTC or receive
some, what can my Tor exit node see / do / harm? He can alter the
content, by modifying and transmitting invalid transactions to the
network but this will have no effect on me, e.g. can't steal coins or
send them on my behalf or intercept my payments, right? It's not clear
for me what data would such a node see? Why would you spend money to
setup a spy node for this what relevant data can it give you?
