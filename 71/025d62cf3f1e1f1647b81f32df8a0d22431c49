Sorry, that is the names come from the original thread, where I was
outlining the idea.  I updated the names.

The bail in transactions are only signed by one of the parties.  They are
kept secret until the refund/payout transactions are all properly signed.

There is a malleability risk though, hence the need for the 3rd party.

It works on the same refund principle as payment channels.

TX0 is not broadcast until the refund transactions are complete.

This is a draft at the moment.

There is an implementation of (almost) this system but not by me.  This
proposal reduces the number of non-standard transaction types required.

A full implement is the next step.

That is a typo, I have updated it.

I can do that.

I wanted it to be as simple as possible, but I guess MIME is just a
different way of doing things.

I would have no objection.
