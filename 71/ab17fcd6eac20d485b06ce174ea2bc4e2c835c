I actually implemented parts of the header+ v<tx> stuff in a branch with
my bloom filter stuff, you can see it here:

Its pretty stupid and would be pretty easy to DoS/get it stuck/etc, but
in theory it works.  I don't see much reason why we'd need anything
significantly more complicated, but maybe there is a use-case I'm
missing?
