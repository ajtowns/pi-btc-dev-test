Can you quantify "additional costs in terms of complicated control flows"?

When considering these costs, using a normal P2SH output + a script
with OP_IF and friends seems more straightforward?

Doing boolean logic with multisig groups is quite possible, e.g.
"group AND group", "group OR (group AND group)" etc.  Definitely a
valid use case.  I discussed how to do this on IRC with gmaxwell
several months ago.  I call it "multi-multisig" for lack of a better
name.
