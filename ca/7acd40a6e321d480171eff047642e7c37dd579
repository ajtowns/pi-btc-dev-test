Makes sense. I would love if GPUs were back as the main hashing tool.

However, we need to consider the environmental impact of mining, which currently consumes a quite exorbitant amount of energy. Any ideas on this front?

There is a big problem here though: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on the current algorithm, and will be a huge loss if this is not done slowly enough, and the miners who control the chain currently would likely never allow this change to happen.

I've heard the term "level playing field" bandied about quite a bit. ? And it seems to me that the risk of state actor control and botnet attacks is less than state-actor manipulation of specialized manufacturing of "SHA-256 forever" hardware. ? Indeed, the reliance on a fairly simple hash seems less and less likely a "feature" and more of a baggage.

Killing the existing POW, and using an as-yet undefined, but deployment-bit ready POW field to flip-flop between the current and the "next one" every 8 years or or so, with a ramp down beginning in the 7th year....? A stub function that is guaranteed to fail unless a new consensus POW is selected within 7 years.
