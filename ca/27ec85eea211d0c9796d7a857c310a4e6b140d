As an end-user of Bitcoin, the whole possible value of a set of mathematical
rules has become completely trashed by the imprecise and unpredictable behavior
of buyers and sellers.

If the rules are not responsive to real human needs, bitcoin is worthless
as a long-term store of value because **my idea of value** changes over time.
This implies, in my mind, an absolutely requirement to attempt to gather 
some useful signal from the human political noise.

How do you determine what that signal is, so you can **change the rules**
and the mathematics so it makes more sense?

You've got to deal with politics, one way or another.
