What you describe is not a fix of replay attack. By confirming the same tx
in both network, the tx has been already replayed. Their child txs do not
matter.


Read it again.

The validation algorithm would be extended so that the transaction can't be
replayed, because replaying it in the other network REQUIRES a child
transaction in the same block that is valid, a child transaction the is
unique to the network. By doing this policy change simultaneously in both
networks, old pre-signed transactions *can not be replayed by anybody but
the owner* of the coins (as he must spend them immediately in the child
transaction).

It means that as soon as spent, the UTXO sets immediately and irrevocably
diverges across the two networks. Which is the entire point, isn't it?
