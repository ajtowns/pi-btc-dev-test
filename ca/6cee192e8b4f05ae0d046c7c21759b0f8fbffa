It is a lot easier to set up an HTTP server to dynamically respond with addresses than a DNS record. ?It is considered a good practice to use a different address for every payment.

Just so we're clear, what is the need for HTTP at all?

A query for a string and an answer can all be handled via DNS.

Could we combine this proposal and the HTTPS proposal?



The DNSSEC TXT record could give instructions on how to query an HTTPS server to get the address. ?Then we get the dynamism of HTTPS without having a rigid URL scheme for querying the server along with the advantages of DNSSEC.
