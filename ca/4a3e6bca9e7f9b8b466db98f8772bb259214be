I think 2 of 3 is a _far_ more useful example than (a or b), ?it is
the prototype for a normal escrow transaction., and still only results
in three address and at most two signatures like the (A and B) or C
case.

You can also replicate the functionality of (a or b) in a hashish and
inefficient sort of way with two of three by simply using a public
known key as one of the roles.
