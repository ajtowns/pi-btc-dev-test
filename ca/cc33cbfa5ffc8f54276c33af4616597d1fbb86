If there is a situation where wallets are supposed to constantly monitor
the tx propagation and recreate their transactions with different fees,
this would make a lot of usecases inconvenient.
half-offline bluetooth transactions, users with unstable connections,
battery power lost, etc, etc. - and last but not least power concerns on
hardware wallets on the bitcoincard (tx signing drains a significant amount
of power and should therefore only be done once)
