What?

Ask yourself; why do miners include transactions at all? What it the incentive 
if there really is only less than 0.8% of income to be derived from fees?

Miners don't get payed by fees.  They won't need to get payed by fees for 
decades to come. Maybe you want to re-do your math, it seems off.
