I get it. :) Being able to run Bitcoin Core on open hardware is a noble (and important) goal! I hope that once we?ve figured out what the current requirements are that we can adjust these requirements (if needed) to include certain open hardware platforms. But that?s the next step. Bitcoin Core is a project in flight. Let?s first see where we?re at.

What are the critical wall-time requirements? As discussed earlier, the block propagation times are very important to keep orphan rates low. This sounds like one of the inputs that can be used to model bandwidth and CPU requirements. Other inputs for this could be as simple as the minimum number of connected nodes (multiplier on outbound bandwidth, but not CPU), etc. It wouldn?t surprise me if many of the real world requirements will center around Bitcoin Core?s ability to talk to the outside world.

Yes there are conversion factors and different architectures will perform differently. However, there still must be some baseline, a point at which we can say processors below it no longer are supported. I am saying that line should never be set so high as to exclude presently available open hardware.

Can you speak to the health of Moxie development? Ultimately, ensuring support for many open architectures would be preferable. Are there other reasonable open-source processors that you are aware of?

You?d be lucky to get about 33% effective utilization out of them (up to 50%, tops, but that?s really pushing it), so if you were to map this onto another architecture, you?d have at least a 3x conversion from this end alone (the other end could also have a scaling factor).

If some metric changes by, say, 5%, then it doesn?t really matter if it?s expressed in MIPS, INTOPS, MB or GB. The fact that it changed is what matters and what the effect is on the baseline (that ultimately could be expressed as a certain specific hardware configuration). It would probably be practical to have a number of comparable concrete min spec configurations and even more ideal would be if people in the community would have these systems up and running to do actual on-target performance benchmarks.
