Yep, I want to chip in and also express my gratitude for these useful tests. I sent a personal email to Gavin before.

I plan to make some more complex tests by combining several of the simpler ones.

Yes, more tests are definitely welcome.

check*sig tests are tricky, because they have to refer to previous
unspent transactions and private keys (so require a particular block
chain to test against). Brilliant ideas on a simple data-driven format
welcome.

block verification tests would be great; a collection of good/bad
block chains, starting from a common chain (maybe the testnet3
tesnet-in-a-box chain) would be very useful for regression testing.
