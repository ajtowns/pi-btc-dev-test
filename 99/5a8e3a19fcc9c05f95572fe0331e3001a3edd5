look at the first line of the if statement

These are interesting thoughts, karma for bitcoins essentially.

I would like CoinLab to publish a 'cost of subverting 1-n transactions with 90% probability' metric soon, and I think it would help everyone to understand what that number is.

When we started out, you probably needed to wait 5 blocks for $10 or $20 of bitcoin value transfer.

Now, I'd happily accept a $1k transaction with 1 confirmation.?

More difficulty shortens the safe time we can transact large volumes in, which is good for the network.

I'm not sure of the current implementation of replacement transactions, can anyone on the core team speak to this? Can I replace transactions, or is that part of the spec unimplemented or deprecated right now?
