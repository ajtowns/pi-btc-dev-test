I agree that dropping zero value outputs is a needless loss of
flexibility.  In addition to the CT example, something similar could
be done for increased precision (nanobitcoin!).

Maybe if in the future the value of 1e-8 btc is high enough then an
argument could be made that requiring one is a meaningful reduction in
a miner's ability to spam up the network... but the argument doesn't
fly today... the cost in lost fee income from the spam just totally
dwarfs it.
