That's incorrect terminology - what I proposed are "TXO commitments". I
proposed that a MMR of all prior transaction outputs's, spent and
unspent, be committed too in blocks along with a spentness flag, not
just spent transaction outputs.

That's why I often use the term (U)TXO commitments to refer to both
classes of proposals.

What I proprosed is that a consensus-critical maximum UTXO age be part
of the protocol; UTXO's younger than that age are expected to be cached.
For UTXO's older than that age, they can be dropped from the cache,
however to spend them you are required to provide the proof, and that
proof counts as blockchain space to account for the fact that they do
need to be broadcast on the network.

The proofs are relatively large, but not so much larger than a CTxIn as
to make paying for that data infeasible.
