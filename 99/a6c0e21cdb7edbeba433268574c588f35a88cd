Hi guys,

I've seen many many non-geeks be utterly intimidated and confused by
0.000XXXXX quantities and/or mBTC & uBTC notation


Yes, $10 being rougnly 10,000 Won in South Korean is a great example where
large amounts of units work very well in a major economy.


FWIW,  I would prefer the entire switch-over be done *once* *and *at the
same time switching both BTC to XBT and using the following


Currency Code *: *XBT
Unit Definition  *: *1 Bit = 100 Satoshis

Addition benefit is splitting the term Bitcoin/bitcoin (as in Network and
currency unit) into Bitcoin (network) and Bit (the unit).


Perhaps this project/process should have a name and be listed on a road map
somewhere

*BRCS: *Bitcoin Re-denomination and [Currency] Code Standardization project


Cheers ...
