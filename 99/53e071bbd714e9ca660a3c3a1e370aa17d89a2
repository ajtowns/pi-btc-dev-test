Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 release candidate 3
Message-ID: <580F9AB9.8010907@mattcorallo.com>

Due to a relatively trivial fix for an out-of-place assertion in rc2
(see
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/58d4fa7da30cb57e5fc3dca62f49a64e126c76cd),
0.13.1rc3 was tagged and is now available on github either via git or at
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v0.13.1rc3.

Because of the simplicity of the change, it was decided that 0.13.1
should not be delayed as a result, and thus no official binaries will be
made available for rc3.

However, any additional testing which folks have time for before final
tag on Thursday would be significantly welcomed.

As usual please report bugs using the issue tracker on github at
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues

Thanks,
Matt
