Some questions:

Does this require information to be added to blocks, or can it work today
on the existing format?

Does this count number of transactions or their total length? The block
limit is in bytes rather than number of transactions, but transaction
number can be a reasonable proxy if you allow for some false negatives but
want a basic sanity check.

Does this allow for proofs of length in the positive direction,
demonstrating that a block is good, or does it only serve to show that
blocks are bad? Ideally we'd like an extension to SPV protocol so light
clients require proofs of blocks not being too big, given the credible
threat of there being an extremely large-scale attack on the network of
that form.
