I guess my question didn't get across. 

Why would you want to make your usecase do connections over the peer2peer 
(net.cpp) connection at all?

Mixing messages that are being sent to everyone and encrypted messages is 
asking for trouble.
Making your private connection out-of-band would work much better.

The statistical attack I mentioned earlier.  Which comes from knowing which 
plain text messages are being sent over the encrypted channel, So as long as 
you keep saying you want to encrypt data that identical copies of are being 
sent to other nodes at practically the same time, you will keep being 
vulnerable to that.
