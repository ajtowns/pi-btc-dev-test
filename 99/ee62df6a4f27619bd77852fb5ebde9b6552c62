Subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.9.2 RC postponed for 7 days
Message-ID: <CAEz79PpK7ofeT9VHUSWgn9NVCHsSBAcZpbSWJhHZ+U5-Cd8JBQ@mail.gmail.com>

The release candidate for 0.9.2 was previously scheduled for May 13th.
 Yesterday it was decided to postpone this for 7 days due to the Bitcoin
2014 Amsterdam conference.  The string freeze is now in effect and it is a
very good time to contribute
translations<https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=582345.0>during
these next 7 days.

http://nightly.bitcoin.it now has separate builds for the master and 0.9.2
branch.  0.9.2 is what will soon become the release while master is
accepting changes that may not be safe for a near-term release.  Read
details <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=571414> about
deterministic reproducibility of the unofficial nightly builds.
