I'm in favor of BIP43.

Adding a "Purpose" node can be used as an identifier for what kind of
tree is in the wallet file we're reading.   I can envision a few
different, common tree structures.  Perhaps using a non-hardened
first-layer derivation (we have clients who want this).  Similarly, my
proposal for a "No-collision mode" for multisig BIP32 trees
<http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/32860512/> is another
variant that might get some traction but not everyone will use it. 
These things could be "supported" by simply changing the BIP43 "Purpose"
index and wallet software could be designed to recognize and react to
the Purpose node for any number of different tree structures, and ignore
any trees that it doesn't recognize (or maybe be able to view the
balance across all the leaves of the tree but not expand it)

We have clients with special use-cases (complex multi-layer trees) that
are unlikely to be recycled across users.  In such cases we might just
use a "random" Purpose that is recognized by their system, and know that
other software won't mess with it.  Though it would be better if that
field was encoded in the root seed, instead.

Nonetheless, putting that extra layer between the root and the
"important" tree nodes provides flexibility to BIP32 as a whole.
