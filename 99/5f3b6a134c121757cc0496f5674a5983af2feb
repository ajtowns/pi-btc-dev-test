Block timestamps are in the 80-byte block header, so activation is
completely deterministic and can be determined from just the sequence of
block headers. There are no edge cases to worry about.

But even more so I would expect there to be significant differences in

It doesn't matter much where in the difficulty period the fork happens; if
it happens in the middle, the lower-power fork's difficulty will adjust a
little quicker.

Example:  (check my math, I'm really good at screwing up at basic
arithmetic):

Fork at block%2016:  25% hashpower will take 8 weeks to produce 2016
blocks, difficulty drops by 4.

Fork one-week (halfway) into difficulty period:  25% hashpower will take 4
weeks to adjust, difficulty drops by 5/2 = 2.5
It will then take another 3.2 weeks to get to the next difficult adjustment
period and normal 10-minute blocks.

That's an unrealisitic scenario, though-- there will not be 25% of hash
power on a minority fork. I wrote about why in a blog post today:

http://gavinandresen.ninja/minority-branches

If you assume a more realistic single-digit-percentage of hash power on the
minority fork, then the numbers get silly (e.g. two or three months of an
hour or three between blocks before a difficulty adjustment).
