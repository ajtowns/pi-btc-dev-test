If bitcoin listened on IPv6 that might help for alot of people. Windows 7
users get a teredo IPv6 address (unless they disable it) when behind NAT on
IPv4. Take any win7 box and put it on a typical NAT /DSL setup this is what
happens. I think this might actually work for more users than have UPNP
support on their DSL gateways. teredo IPs aren't that stable though (they
change frequently) and they might tend to flood the address cache with stale
addresses.
