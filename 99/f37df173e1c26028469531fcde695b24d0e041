Mike,

If bitcoinj will be ready and you will help us, we are willing to implement it right away in Hive as well. We will also keep BitcoinKit.framework updated with the new bitcoind and bitcoinj implementations.

BitPay taking the lead here would be tremendous. Hopefully cool sites like Bitcoin Store will also be game to hit the ground running. I'll ask them.

Someone volunteered last week to do it for bitcoinj and if he doesn't pull through, I have some old code from EOY 2012 that I could update to the latest spec and ship at least some basic support. I'd hope that we can get Bitcoin Wallet or MultiBit updates out once bcj has support pretty fast.
