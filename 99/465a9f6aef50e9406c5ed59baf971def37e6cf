First of all, we can easily do this in a way where miners show their support
for this change, say with the usual 95% approval threshold we've been using for
soft-forks. That gets the % of hashing power on a AsicBoost chain fork down to
5% at most.

Secondly, we can probably make the consensus PoW allow blocks to be mined using
both the existing PoW algorithm, and a very slightly tweaked version where
implementing AsicBoost gives no advantage. That removes any incentive to
implement AsicBoost, without making any hardware obsolete (such as 21inc's
hardware). This means that no hashing power at all needs to use the AsicBoost
patent.

Obviously, the fact that miners can support such a change (assuming of course
the economic majority approves it as well) changes the negotiation position re:
licensing fees; the actual outcome may simply be you guys make the patent 100%
public for all to use at a much reduced price, given you're lack of negotiation
strength.

I think _patented_ optimizations where one party has a monopoly are very
different than optimizations that anyone can independently rediscover -
AsicBoost itself looks to be something that two or three parties independently
discovered.

...which is a scenario that may result in a dozen patented optimizations, with
new ASIC manufacturers needing a dozen licenses, from potentially hostile
entities.

For instance, it's not clear to me if you actually own this patent, or
Cointerra's creditors. Obviously in the latter case, it'd be quite possible
that some kind of bankrupcy court ruling results in the patent getting sold to
a hostile entity who will use it against all of Bitcoin. Equally, even if it is
100% owned by you and Sergio, it'd be very easy for a personal bankrupcy to
result in the same scenario (suppose you get into a car accident and lose a
negligence lawsuit over it).
