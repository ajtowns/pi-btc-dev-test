Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Scaling at the end user level
Message-ID: <CAD2Ti2_vGc+SJX_+uTz4ZVk1r5DhCOm6n3yKW16o9QaPKTQkHQ@mail.gmail.com>

A freshly deployed client on an old p4 has been idly crunching away
at building and verifying the initial chain for about a week now. It
should be done in a day or two. This seems rather untenable for
new users. Have any groups published proposals for distributing
a weekly precomputed bootstrap chain?
rsync? db_dump > git > db_load?
There is also 50% or more compression available in the index
and chain.
Of some known future issues... raw transaction rate, the eventual pay
(or extort?, depending on how megapools pan out) to process mining
environment, and scaling the client count itself... this one appears to
be already present.
