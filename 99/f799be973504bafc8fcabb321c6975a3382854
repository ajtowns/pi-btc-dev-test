That's because its not.

If you have a node that is "old" your node will stop getting new blocks. 
The node will essentially just say "x-hours behind" with "x" getting larger 
every hour. Funds don't get confirmed. etc.

After upgrading the software they will see the new reality of the network.

Nobody said its a problem, because its not.
