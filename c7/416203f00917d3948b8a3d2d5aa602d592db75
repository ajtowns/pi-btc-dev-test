I stand corrected. A permanent 1-way-peg is sufficient to preserve
scarcity; "nothing else can do that" WRT 2-way-pegs was overreaching.

I still don't see what "2-way-peg vs. 1-way-peg" has to do with
"embedded consensus vs. blockchain consensus" though, and feel it
disingenious to conflate them.

Blockchain consensus (eg. sidechains) can utilise either mechanism,
1-way-peg or 2-way-peg. Arguments in favour of 1-way-peg are
interesting, but they're ultimatley just arguments in favour of one
type of sidechain over another.

Arguments in favour of embedded consensus - and I feel I'm being
generous with the term "consensus" here - should surely stand on their
own merit against blockchain consensus, if they're to be convincing.

IMO the question of whether scarcity can be preserved while enabling
innovation bears heavily on the liklihood of longterm viability of
said innovations - and perhaps of Bitcoin itself.

FWIW I'll happily declare that I hold a modest amount of BTC and have
an interest in the price appreciating. I'm sure you'll admit you're
hardly an impartial party in this discussion yourself Peter :) But it
really shouldn't matter. I'm not here today to make it, but I think
the argument for preservation of scarcity stands quite well on its own
merits - as rightly it should, regardless of anybody's interests.

Very interesting. I admit I hadn't come across these ideas before; I
really must search the archive before posting :) They certainly offer
a measure of robustness over the naive approach. I'm not sure they
address my primary concerns however, WRT how consensus is demonstrated
and incentivised.

I know what my own node considers valid transaction history; how can I
be confident that everyone else takes the same view? For contrast,
with blockchain consensus, I can be confident that there is consensus
on the longest chain observed. If I receive a new transaction, simply
waiting for it to be buried under N blocks of PoW provides a high
level of confidence that everyone else considers it valid.

The obvious "embedded consensus" answer of "wait until N other
transactions have occurred that include a hash of system state that
includes your transaction" doesn't provide me with any confidence; it
could be simulated with a Sybil attack.

Indeed :) To avoid wasting time it's only ever worth arguing against
the strongest opposing position you're aware of (whether your opponent
is aware of it or not.)
