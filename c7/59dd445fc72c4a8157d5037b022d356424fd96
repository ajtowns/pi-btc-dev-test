Interesting. I think the original BitDNS discussion was more interesting
that what currently is happening with namecoin, see
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.0

Satoshi said there: "1) IP records don't need to be in the chain, just do
registrar function not DNS.  And CA problem solved, neat."

Besides, ICANN is currently selling out the global public namespace - not
that anybody really cares about such measly topics as the ownership of
global namespaces. And so some guy on the Cayman Islands is now the largest
holder of TLD's.
