Note how due to bandwidth being generally asymetric your findings are probably optimistic - you've measured download capacity. On top of that upload is further reduced by the fact that multiple peers at once need to be sent blocks for reliability.

Secondly you're measuring a network that isn't under attack - we need significant additional margin to resist attack as performance is consensus-critical.
