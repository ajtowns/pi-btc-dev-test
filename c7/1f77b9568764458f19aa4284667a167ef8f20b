This seems strange to me -- why wouldn't you just assume every signature
is 65 witness bytes, and just be grateful for the prioritisation benefit
if someone chooses a shorter signature? Your error margin is just 0.25
vbytes per signature.

An alternative generalisation: is there a proof that all valid witnesses
will have a weight within some small range?

(DEPTH 2 NUMNOTEQUAL seems like it would have been more obvious...)
