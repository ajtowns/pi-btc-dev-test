Hi Jeff

There where previous discussions about similar approaches [1] [2].

I?m not sure if compression should be built into the protocol.
My humble understanding of it, is, that it should be built into different layers.

If bandwidth is a concern, then on the fly gzip compression like apaches mod_deflate could be something. But I expect fast propagation is often more important then a ~30% bandwidth reduction.
Bandwidth may be a concern for historical blocks transmission. If you continue the proposal, I think you should focus on historical blocks.

If disk space is a concern, then the database layer should handle the compression.

Thanks
?

Simply applying various compression algorithms, I was able to achieve about a 50% compression ratio. Here are my findings on a recent Bitcoin block using max compression for all methods:

I ran all from the command line and did not notice any lag as I pressed enter to do the compression, so easily less than a second. But compression time doesn't matter, decompression time is what matters as blocks will be decompressed billions of times more than they will be compressed. Decompression speed for LZ4 is the fastest of the above methods, at 3.3GB / second, slightly less than half the speed of memcpy, see char at (https://github.com/lz4/lz4 <https://github.com/lz4/lz4>).
