That's a good point. In the paper, they have a deterministic wallet
scheme in section 3.3.  It is non-interactive, so that's good.  On the
other hand, it's not BIP32, so that adds complexity.

Good points, although multisig is catching on quickly in the ecosystem.
AFAIK, all production wallets can send to p2sh addresses.
