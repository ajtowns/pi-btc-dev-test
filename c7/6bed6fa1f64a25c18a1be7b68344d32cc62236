Thank you.

I also appreciate your commentary[1], and willingness to list your investment
position. What I'm concerned about are people who have signed non-disclosure 
agreements or who's salary/equity/whatever depend on people who are experts
at manipulating markets to take naive investors money.

Independent is also a state of mind as much as it is about financial connections.

What pisses me off here is that a huge amount of wealth just changed hands based
on MtGox's press release, and it stinks of insider trading. I still maintain the
best outcome would be for MtGox to AGPLv3 release their code, and then those of 
us that understand it would be able to have a public technical discussion about
how to fix it, and MtGox would still maintain their intellectual property
ownership position.

This, however, cuts off a significant revenue stream for people who take money
making market bets 5 minutes before the information goes public, so I expect
the likelyhood of such an outbreak of sanity is quite low.

DISCLAIMER: I have a significant emotional investment in copyleft/viral copyright
development models, and I expect to take a lot of money charging people to write
code I give away for free. I also occasionally make money from cryptocurrency
mining, but only when I can sell it in functional and transparent markets.
