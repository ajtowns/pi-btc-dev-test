A ban-subnet RPC would be a reasonable addition, but obviously DoS
attackers that are IP or bandwidth constrained are really just script
kiddies. Also anything that involves every node operator doing manual
intervention rather works against decentralisation and having a big
network. That's why I keep pushing for automated heuristic driven
prioritisation.
