Yo can fool a SPV wallet even if it requires a thousands confirmations
using this attack, and you don't need a Sybil attack, so yes, it impacts
SPV wallets also. The protections a SPV node should have to prevent this
attack are  different, so it must be considered separately.

It should be said that a SPV node can avoid accepting payments if any
Merkle node is at the same time a valid transaction, and that basically
almost eliminates the problem.

SPV Wallet would reject valid payments with a astonishingly low probability.
