Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Lookinf for issues to contribute to
Message-ID: <CAHtYR9E4GpwBqqmD0HDKutiXeg=cDtpyvhd_+23srv5_c1AFQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

I want to contribute to bitcoin core. I am an intermediate programmer and
want to get started contributing fast. I have already cloned the git
repository. Can you maybe direct me to sources where I can learn more about
the structure of bitcoin core and specifically to problems where I can get
experience working with the source code?

I know Python, C/C++ and a bit of Java. I have advanced knowledge of
cryptographic concepts and procedures and try to teach myself some of the
math, especially around elliptic curves. I am currently composing a
bachelor thesis around the question of Blockchain usage in the
car-industry, where I try to look at different aspects of protocol-design.


Best Regards
Daniel
