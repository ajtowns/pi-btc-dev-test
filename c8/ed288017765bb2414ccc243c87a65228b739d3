It's the same with Bluetooth. More and more people use audio via
Bluetooth, mostly because they use a headset or stream their music to
their stereo at home.

Those that still switch off Bluetooth all the time can simply press a

True, but those people who switch off Bluetooth will also simply not
install the app because of that permission.
