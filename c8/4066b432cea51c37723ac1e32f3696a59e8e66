Mike and all,

Pierre and I just committed a prototype implementation of the recurring payment protocol using bitcoinj. You can find the diff on our fork: 
https://github.com/killbill/bitcoinj/commit/40c657c4191498f12539c60316116aa68af368a7

We did not write the server (merchant side), but wanted to have some feedback before going deeper (merchant implementation and tests). We did our best to build it on top of the existing BIP-0070 protocol-- only a few additions in the messages, but no new calls and no new uri scheme. We created a new package 'recurring' where most of the new code lives.

At a high level:

1. Creation of the subscription:

The initial handshake for creating the subscription is exactly similar to the one for the payment protocol (PaymentRequest is used to provide the contract)

2. Wallet can decide to poll the merchants for its active subscriptions.

Here the flow is exactly similar to the payment protocol but the wallet receives a callback to verify the payment matches the contract and should go through.

Please give us some feedback whenever you have the chance. In the meantime we will start implementing the merchant side and test the code.

Cheers!

We are pretty new to that community and so we don't know exactly what the process is, and in particular how we reach consensus via email. I am certainly open to follow 'the way' if there is one, but one solution would be to follow Mike's suggestion on providing a (prototype) implementation first and then defining/refining the BIP. Odinn also suggested a possible retribution for our time through crowd-sourcing which I am interested to pursue if that makes sense.

The main goal here is to have the customer subscribe to a service of some kind (that is, agreeing on the terms of that subscription contract), and then have the wallet make recurring payments without any intervention from the customer as long as the payments match what the customer agreed on paying.

Note that there is also usage based billing: for example, the user may need to purchase additional access for premium videos (overage charges). This type of billing is more complicated and there are many variations to it used in the industry (pre-paid, ?). For the sake of discussion, we?ll focus on fixed recurring payments only, but we will keep usage in mind to make sure the protocol will be able to support it as well.

It could even be zero if the user decides to make a one-time payment to the merchant directly using a different wallet. Hence, the wallet needs to get the latest invoice balance to make sure how much it should pay. This also opens the door for the support of overage charges.

This goes often hand in hand with a dunning system, which progressively restricts access as the user's account is more and more overdue. Since wallets can be offline for an extended period of time, payments may be missed and lead to an overdue state (e.g. extra fees, service degraded). It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure the wallet is up often enough for payments to happen.

> In that recurring phase where the wallet polls the merchant, the wallet is responsible to check that payments match the subscription contract; that is, the amount, frequency of payments, ? match what the customer agreed on. If so, the payment is made without asking for explicit approval from customer, and the flow is similar to BIP-0070: The message is sent to the merchant, and in parallel, a transaction is sent to the btcnet. The merchant sends an ACK to the wallet and of course checks the states of the transactions on the btcnet to mark that payment as successful.

Of course, we could also simply support a cancellation followed by a creation of a new subscription, but having that as a one atomic message is probably better. The steps are very similar to the initial registration.
