I don't think the solution should be to "fix the replay attack", but
rather to "force the replay effect". The fact that transactions can be
relayed should be seen as a good thing, and not something that should
be fixed, or even called an "attack".

The solution should be to create a "bridge" that replays all
transactions from one network over to the other, and vice-versa. A
fork should be transparent to the end-user. Forcing the user to choose
which network to use is bad, because 99% of people that use bitcoin
don't care about developer drama, and will only be confused by the
choice. When a user moves coins mined before the fork date, both
blockchains should record that transaction. Also a rule should be
introduced that prevents users "tainting" their prefork-mined coins
with coins mined after the fork. All pre-fork mined coins should
"belong" to the network with hashpower majority. No other networks
should be able to claim pre-forked coins as being part of their
issuance (and therefore part of market cap). Market cap may be
bullshit, but it is used a lot in the cryptosphere to compare coins to
each other.

The advantage of pre-fork coins being recorded on both forks is that
if one fork goes extinct, no one loses any money. This setup
encourages the minority chain to die,and unity returned. If pre-fork
coins change hands on either fork (and not on the other), then holders
have an incentive to not let their chain die, and the networks will be
irreversibly split forever. The goal should be unity not permanent
division.
