Subject: [Bitcoin-development] New Project Discussion
Message-ID: <CAPfzCrQ04iDXGm6yc0B+WGvFELWM7_isD9f5QqOCQkhu4tOp5g@mail.gmail.com>

I have a proposal and design for a new project built on bitcoin.
Where should I post my initial proposal and design to start a
discussion?  Its of interest to bitcoin folks and a wide range of
others.  Its totally cool and a first-of-its-kind and I want to start
discussing it.  I'd like to discuss it on this list if its
appropriate.  Its entirely built on bitcoind, so I need your comments.
