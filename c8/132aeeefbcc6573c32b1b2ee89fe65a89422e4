One interesting thing to do is to compare how much does it cost to maintain
a bank check account and how much does it cost to run a full node.

It seems that it is about 120USD/year in USA:

A 4TB hard drive ~=115USD
https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LQQH86A/ref=mp_s_a_1_4

And it has a warranty of 3 years.

As your calculation shows, it will take more than 19 years to reach 4TB
with a 4MB blocksize.

I'm one of the co-authors of that study. I'd be the first to agree with
your conclusion
and argue that the 4MB size suggested in that paper should not be used
without
compensation for two important changes to the network.


Our recent measurements of the Bitcoin P2P network show that network speeds
have improved tremendously. From February 2016 to February 2017, the average
provisioned bandwidth of a reachable Bitcoin node went up by approximately
70%.
And that's just in the last year.


4 * 144 * 30 = 17.3GB per month, or 207GB per year. Full node
initialisation will become prohibitive for most users until a shortcut is
made (e.g. witness pruning and UTXO commitment but these are not trust-free)


Further, the emergence of high-speed block relay networks, like Falcon (
http://www.falcon-net.org)
and FIBRE, as well as block compression, e.g. BIP152 and xthin, change the
picture dramatically.


Also as the co-author of the selfish mining paper, you should know all
these technology assume big miners being benevolent.


So, the 4MB limit mentioned in our paper should not be used as a protocol
limit today.

Best,
- egs
