Not so much that the implementation is difficult, as it requires context 
to validate a block size, rather than being able to validate it without 
requiring the preceeding blocks. Yes, time on different machines may 
vary, but block time is safe to use for this, because it's a 
straight-forward test of "if block time is acceptable and block time is 
after <date> then maximum block size allowed is n MB otherwise m MB".
