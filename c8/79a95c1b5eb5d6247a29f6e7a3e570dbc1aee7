 - Adaptive r choice shouldn't be possible since r is derived from the
original threshold prf and it's not possible for a party to have any
adaptive impact on the value of r
 - I'm guess I don't see how an attacker can use adaptive key choice in
this context either.   Any modification of the key should be useless
AH!

I forgot to include some assumptions.   The important part here is that
each party only has a share of the private key and publishes a share of the
public key.

This hopefully should preclude any sort of adaptive key attack.

>From scratch:

1. Has a public g^x'
2. Computes and broadcasts g^k' ... where k' is a random number
3. Computes r = g^k using lagrange interpolation (see
http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/homprf.pdf)
4. Computes H(r || M), as per standard schnorr
5. Computes s' = k' - xe , as per standard schnorr .. except k' is a "share"
6. Publish (s', e, g^x')

Verification:

With m of n share-signatures:

1. Interpolation on m of n s' shares to get s
2. Interpolation on m of n g^x' shares to get g^x
3. Standard schnorr verification

The actual public key of the "set of signers" is interpolated.
