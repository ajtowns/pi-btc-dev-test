Right you are!
I saw Thomas's email about Electrum 2.0 not supporting BIP39.
It seems he had the idea that the wordlist was a strict requirement yet it is not, it is unfortunate that Electrum did not go the route of BIP39. The wordlist is irrelevant and merely used to help build mnemonics.
Also as I've shown, you can work a version into it, I was going to actually propose it to the BIP39 authors but didn't think it was an issue.
I think BIP39 is fantastic.
I think Electrum 2.0 (And everyone)?should use BIP39? On 2015-03-11 06:21 PM, Thy Shizzle wrote:

Unfortunately there's more incompatibility than just the date issue:

* seed: some follow BIP39, and some roll their own
* HD structure: some follow BIP44, some BIP32 derivation, and some roll
their own

So actually very few wallets are seed-compatible, even ignoring the date
question.

That's a reasonable solution.
