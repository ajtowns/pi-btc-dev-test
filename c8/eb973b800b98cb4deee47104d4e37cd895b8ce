Not at all - ACK from me, fwiw. Any attempt at a double spend should be
shouted from the housetops.

What Miners should do with that is still up for debate, it seems. My
opinion is that they should hold on and attempt to confirm the first,
letting it go only if a conflicting transaction is mined elsewhere. (Let
your Yes mean Yes...) But I understand the contrary arguments.
