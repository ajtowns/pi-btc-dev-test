I think you misunderstood my proposal. What you'd do is the transaction
is spendable by either Bob OR (Bob AND Alice) and before
broadcast/during construction/whatever sign a new transaction that
spends it and is only spendable by Alice, but is timelocked for 24
hours. At the 24h mark, Alice broadcasts the transaction and once it is
confirmed only Alice can claim the money.
