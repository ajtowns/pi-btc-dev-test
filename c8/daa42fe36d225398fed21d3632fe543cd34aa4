Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BLS library released
Message-ID: <CAHUJnBCyhaKU+P2RYHv=+8jDpV6tk53qNStbh0WKFAw8hXSj7Q@mail.gmail.com>

BLS signatures have the same aggregation feature as Schnorr signatures but
even better because the aggregation can be done non-interactively, at the
expense of being a bit slower. We just released a first draft (but fully
functional) library for doing BLS signatures based on a construction based
on musig. Feedback, discussion, and usage is very welcome.
