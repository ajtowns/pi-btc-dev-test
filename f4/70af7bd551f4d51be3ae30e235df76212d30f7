You could say 256 bit ECDSA is overkill lets go to 160 equivalently.
Saves even more bytes.

The problem with arguing down is where to stop.

As Matt said these things dont degrade gracefully so a best practice
is to aim for a bit of extra margin.

256-bit is quite common at this point since AES, SHA256 etc even in
things with much less at stake than Bitcoin.

You could send the compressed (unhashed) pubkey then there's no hash
(and omit it from the sig).  Greg had mentioned that in the past.

I think it might be possible to do both (reclaim the hash bits in the
serialisation of the pub key).
