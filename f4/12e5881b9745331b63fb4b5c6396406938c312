Scan all branches for UTXOs, then you have the balance for the wallet. Account 
balances are metadata, so cannot be known from the seed alone. If you want to 
have a way to restore accounts, you must define some more detailed wallet file 
format (which could be built on top of this).

Sure, it *knows* what address was used to receive it. But at the point it's a 
UTXO, that address is no longer relevant.
