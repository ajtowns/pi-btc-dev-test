I disagree. Returning an empty "inv" is a very strange way of replying
"empty mempool". Bitcoin P2P is not a request-response protocol, and
"inv" messages are sent where there are inventory items to send. The
reaction to a request (for example "getblocks") can be nothing, or one
or more "inv" messages if necessary. Special casing an empty "inv" to
mean empty mempool is trying to hack a request-response system on top
of the asynchronous system.

If there is need for confirming the transmission of the mempool is
complete, the proposal to use a MSG_MEMTX sounds good to me. No client
will ever receive such an inv without requesting the mempool, and
implementing handling MSG_MEMTX is trivial.
