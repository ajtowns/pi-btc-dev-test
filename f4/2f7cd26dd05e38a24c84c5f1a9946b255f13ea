I'm not sure I understand the whole proposal, but it seems to me that
having different characteristics, bitcoins and zerocoins would be
different currencies.
I don't see the need to peg zerocoins to bitcoins.
It is great to have an anonymous p2p currency, maybe some bitcoin
users that use bitcoin because of the transparency they allow (public
funds expenditures could be more transparent than they have ever been)
don't like this hard-fork. Well, maybe this is not the main reason,
but I think this could be highly controversial.
Maybe everybody likes it, but can you expand more on the
justifications to peg the two currencies?
If you're requiring one chain look at the othe for validations (miners
will have to validate both to mine btc) you don't need the cross-chain
contract, you can do it better.

Instead of doing this:

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_5:_Trading_across_chains

You could do something like this:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=31643.0

This very idea has been proposed recently by othe people, but I can't
find where.

The problem with this is of course scalabilty. Once you do it for what
chain, why not the others?
You can't validate 100 chains to mine bitcoin even if they're all
merged mined: that's asking miners too much.
If zerocoin enjoys this privilege why not, for example?

As some of you may know, Mark Friedenbach and I are working on a
protocol modification to support issuance of arbitrary assets. Would
be something like colored coins but better, we're calling it
FreiMarkets. Of course these assets are not p2p like bitcoin or
freicoin themselves: they have a centralized issuer.
But if you allowed to sacrifice real bitcoins (as opposed to IOUs
denominated in BTC like you have, for example, in ripple) so they
appear in Freicoin's chain and turn them back, you could have p2p
bitcoins inside Freicoin's chain.
Maybe ripplers want that too. If FreiMarkets prove to work well on
freicoin and be scalable enough, maybe a lot of scamcoins apply the
hardfork too and they want to have p2p btc in their chain as well.

Maybe I could have explained this without even mentioning FreiMarkets,
but my point is that you're asking for a lot like it was nothing.
Zerocoin-bitcoin fungibility hardfork is opening a little pandora's
box. Are we ready?

I was waiting for others to comment and I'm surprised that no one else
has made any objection yet. But if no one's going to point out the
controvery that is so obvious to me, I feel almost like a
responsability to act like a Devil's advocate here.
So if you make bitcoin and zerocoin fungible, I want bitcoins to be
transferrable to freicoin's chain. And I warn you there will be many
more people asking for the same thing on other chains. What criteria
will we have to say yes or no?
