The notification transaction portion is my least-favorite portion of the
spec, but I don't see any alternatives that provide an unambiguous
improvement, including your suggestion.

One of the most highly-weighted goals of this proposal is to be usable
on as many mobile/light wallets as possible.

I know for sure that all existing platforms for balance querying index
by address. Support for bloom filters or other querying methods is less
comprehensive, meaning the set of wallets that can support payment codes
would be smaller.
