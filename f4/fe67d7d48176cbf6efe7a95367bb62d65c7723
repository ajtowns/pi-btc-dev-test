Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin Core build system (automake vs cmake)
Message-ID: <CADxo8WLrKxkUHpQSYb-Yoq0Nzv9QP=k5qBmS2wiqhp0P8=rSMA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I wonder why automake has become the build system for Bitcoin Core?
I mean - why not cmake which is considered better?
Can you please point to the relevant discussion or explanation?

Thanks,
