It cannot possibly be enforced.  Enforcement is not important when you're
setting defaults.  In fact, you don't want to enforce defaults, but rather
allow anyone who cares to deviate from them to do so.

The importance of default behavior is proportional to the number of folks
who mess with the defaults, and that, among miners, is pretty small as far
as I know, at least in the area of deciding how to decide which block to
build on when two show up at nearly the same time.
