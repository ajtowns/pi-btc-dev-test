The problem is one of individual incentives leading to a systemic problem.
"All X should do..." solutions which are oblivious to individual incentives
don't scale, eg: "If all factories avoid emitting pollution they don't pay
for..." does not work if individual factories save their own costs by
dumping into the environment.  No one wants environmental catastrophe, and
no one wants a blockchain where miners don't validate transactions, but
there may be a systemic problem of incentives.

The bitcoin.org claim that "about half" of miner capacity does SPV Mining,
is consistent with the incentives problem as I described it.  However, I
don't claim the state of mining is certainly due to these incentives and
not other incentives we haven't discussed.  Also, there may be other
incentives that outweigh this issue.

If there's any cost to non-SPV mining, and the chance that an incoming
block contains only valid transactions is very high, isn't there still an
incentive to make this timeout longer and longer?


The average cost to the miner from building on an invalid block is small,

Yes. If it's rare enough, then skipping transaction validation saves more
cost than the expected cost of mining atop an invalid block.  ... but if
everyone follows that logic, the chance is no longer rare.

This is a good point.  If the benefit to skipping verification outweighs
expected transaction costs, then a non-validating miner might also choose
to mine empty blocks with only their coinbase.  (I recall hearing this
occurred somewhat regularly around 2013, but I haven't paid attention since
then.  How common are empty blocks these days?)

This is a benefit of the world where transaction fees approach or surpass
block reward.

Oh.  This is a different explanation than Peter Todd's I linked to above,
which claimed it was network latency in receiving transactions.

Could you explain this a bit more?  What is not needed, the hashing
hardware or the power?  How does SPV Mining affect that?

I'll bet there are many individual rationales for SPV-Mining, but
ultimately they come down to dropping a cost based on a bet about other
miners' behavior.
