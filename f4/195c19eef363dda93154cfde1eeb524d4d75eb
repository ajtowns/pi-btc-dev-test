No, the only cure is the check the hashes. We should know something
about hashes here. TLS is a big pile of 'too big to audit'. Spend
a couple of satoshis and put the hash of the source tar.gz and the
binaries in the blockchain. Problem solved.

I used to think encryption was important, and this exchange convinced
me that kerberized telnet with no encryption but with integrity
checking would be far more secure than 'secure' shell.

Also, there's some organization that's inserting malicious memes
that try to get me to buy shit below my signature. How about we 
move the mailing list? I've run mailman servers before, and there's
also http://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/WhyChooseSavannah/
