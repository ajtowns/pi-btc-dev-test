I personally would welcome alternative clients as a vulnerability in the
main client right now has the potential to kill the entire network.

Changes to the protocol are hard, mainly because hashes of packets are used
to identify transactions and blocks, and even the target hash is a hash of a
packet.
As for your proposal to eliminate some parts of the protocol, I have to
agree (the magic bytes seem an ugly hack by satoshi as I discussed with
Mike, and the double SHA256 hashes as checksums are incredibly wasteful, and
seem to have been chosen simply because a double hashing was already
implemented).

Changes should be implemented with backward compatibility in mind, even if
it restricts the freedom of what can be changed.

Having a Wiki or a single Wikipage to list proposed changes, with all pro
and cons, maybe pointing back to the original discussion would be nice. But
don't forget that situations change, and features that have been shot down
way back might become reachable/desirable at a later time, so please don't
just use it as a method to shoot down ideas, but as a way to bring people up
to speed and, if necessary, continue the discussion where it left.
