Absolutely.  This is a key address-non-reuse case we really need to
solve.  Miner payouts, BitPay salary payouts, etc. all use a
statically provided, manually changed address.

Rotating through multiple outputs is a stopgap -- but IMO a useful
one.  HD wallets will solve this in a better way, but existing randkey
systems will be around for a long time.
