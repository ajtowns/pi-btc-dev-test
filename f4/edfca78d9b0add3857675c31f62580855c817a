Thanks for your comments.

In the case of a softfork, as long as an user waits for a few 
confirmations, the risk of money loss is very low. In the worst case 
they run a full node with SPV security. In the case of a hardfork, the 
consequence of failing to upgrade to the economic majority fork *is* 
fatal, even if an user waits for 1000 confirmations. Not to mention the 
risk of having 2 economically active forks. That's why wallets should 
STOP accepting and sending tx after a hardfork bit is detected and wait 
for users' instructions.

No, the "triggering block" you mentioned is NOT where the hardfork 
starts. Using BIP101 as an example, the hardfork starts when the first 
 >1MB is mined. For people who failed to upgrade, the "grace period" is always zero, which is the moment they realize a hardfork.
