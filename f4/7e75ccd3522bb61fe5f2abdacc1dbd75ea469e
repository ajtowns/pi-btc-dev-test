Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Final status
Message-ID: <201602082217.57146.luke@dashjr.org>

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/314 proposes updating the status of many 
Accepted BIPs to Final:

BIP 11: M-of-N Standard Transactions
BIP 14: Protocol Version and User Agent
BIP 21: URI Scheme
BIP 22: getblocktemplate - Fundamentals
BIP 23: getblocktemplate - Pooled Mining
BIP 31: Pong message
BIP 32: Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
BIP 34: Block v2, Height in Coinbase
BIP 35: mempool message
BIP 37: Connection Bloom filtering
BIP 65: OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY

This PR has been open for a week, and I plan to merge it within the next week 
unless there are objections.

Additionally, https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/315 proposes to upgrade 
five additional from Draft to Final status, and preferably needs ACKs from the 
champions of the BIPs:

BIP 50: March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem, by Gavin Andresen
BIP 60: Fixed Length "version" Message (Relay-Transactions Field), by Amir
        Taaki
BIP 64: getutxo message, by Mike Hearn
BIP 66: Strict DER signatures, by Pieter Wuille
BIP 73: Use "Accept" header for response type negotiation with Payment Request
        URLs, by Stephen Pair

Thanks,

Luke
