Yadayadayada.

If someone could threaten the network by releasing a hard-forking bitcoind
version, then already all is lost. Bitcoins stability does not (and cannot)
depend on the "good will" of anyone. If it would, we should all abandon
this silly project. Relying on the good will of people is the worst idea
one could have.

So please (please please) go ahead and release your hardforking bitcoinds
you have been holding back. Competition is everything.

Cheers
