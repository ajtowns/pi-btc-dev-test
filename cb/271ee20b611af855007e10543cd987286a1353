Prefer a three-arg version (gbits-to-compare, blocknum, hash):
- If <bits> is 0 or > 256, invalid.
- If the hash length is not (<bits> + 7) / 8, invalid.
- If the hash unused bits are not 0, invalid.
- Otherwise <bits> of hash is compared to lower <bits> of blockhash.

This version also lets you play gambling games on-chain!

Or maybe I've just put another nail in CBAH's coffin?

Cheers,
Rusty.
