Thanks to everyone with advice re: editing text on github, and Mt. Gox' control of the wiki. Regarding the latter, "SerajewelKS" and "gmaxwell" in IRC/bitcoin confirmed that fixes are underway, but didn't give specifics. I'll wait.

Regarding text editing, special thanks to Wladimir for the simplest solution:

> - Go to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.9.0/doc/release-notes.md
> - Click "edit"
> - Make your changes and add a commit message describing the change, usually something like 'doc: Add missing foowidget to release notes'.

I'll try to make time to go over the 0.9.0rc2 text soon. Cheers,
