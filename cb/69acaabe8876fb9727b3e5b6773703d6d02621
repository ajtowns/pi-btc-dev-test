That's true, but we can extend the DNS seeding protocol a little bit - you
could query <current-chain-height>.dnsseed.whatever.com and the DNS server
then only returns nodes it knows matches your requirement.

This might complicate existing seeds a bit, and it's a bit of a hack, but
protocol-wise it's still possible. Of course if you want to add more
dimensions it gets uglier fast.
