HOWEVER, the impact on this feature RE user population is
unpredictable.  Users may see bigger than expected numbers, and switch
off their node.

Meh.  I like example configs, perhaps tuned by the distro.  If the
distro (_not_ Bitcoin Core upstream) chooses to install a bitcoin.conf
in the proper location, that's up to them.

Agreed with conditions:
1) The distro MUST let bitcoin devs dictate which dependent libs are
shipped with / built statically into the bitcoin binaries/libs.
2) The distro MUST permit fresh updates even to older stable distros.
2) The maintainer(s) MUST be active, and follow bitcoin development,
release status, etc. on a near-daily basis, be able to respond quickly
if security issues arise, etc.

Matt C seems to do a good job of this in Ubuntu PPA, I'm told.

The best path for this is figure out what statistics you want to see,
and have bitcoind export those raw numbers to any willing consumer.
Then write your bitcoind-top on top of that.

In progress.  Disable-wallet support, at compile time or runtime, was
the first step.

No, you don't want this (and it's not possible in many cases anyway).
