Side chains are a way to scale and shard horizontally while still retaining
primary security parameters of the main chain.

The future is an Internet of chains, a forest of chains with bitcoin as the
root chain for: factom / proofofexistence, ChainDB, Blockstream side
chains, merge mined side chains, and more.  A multi-chain design is much
more scalable in general.
