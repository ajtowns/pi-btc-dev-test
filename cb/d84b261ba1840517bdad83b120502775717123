Its not that people dislike the forums or dislike having the forums.
Its that they are giving bitcoin a very, very bad name with all the
illegal crap, etc in them to the point of even possibly creating legal
risk in the future.  So its best that the forums are marked as
unofficial and not part of Bitcoin proper but just some group of kids
who for some reason think Bitcoin is good for their drug-buying habits.
