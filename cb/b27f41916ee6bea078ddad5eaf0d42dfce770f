Agreed.  A TX is just a signed message.  No reason why it -must- use
mainnet's distributed notary service.

IIRC pay-to-IP was removed because it was unreliable -and- detrimental
to privacy?  ISTR Satoshi specifically disliking the privacy elements
of p2ip.

But I also have a "gut feeling" that these sorts of payments and
direct communication should be done via a wholly separate protocol
than the bitcoin P2P protocol.  Doing p2ip as it was done originally,
inside the bitcoin P2P protocol, was a mistake.  Extensible as it is,
I think a better job -- and faster evolution -- can be done with a
separate protocol on a separate port.

Some HTTP derivative would probably make life easier for mobile
payments and firewalled scenarios, and for client->merchant
communications, for instance.
