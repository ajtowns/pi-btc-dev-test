I was never officially assigned any number for this.

Subsequent P2SH changes give the required functionality in an alternative
way.  This renders the BIP obsolete.

I suggest marking the number as nonassignable, in order to prevent
confusion with archive searches.  I assume that new BIP numbers will be
greater than 100 anyway.

As was pointed out at the time, I shouldn't have used a number in the
original git branch before being assigned it officially.
