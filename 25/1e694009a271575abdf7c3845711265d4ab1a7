Stealth addresses and SPV don't mix well, so no. I wrote up a description
of how to do something similar with the payment protocol here:

Because you can send data around outside the block chain on private
channels, with the pp the same issues don't crop up.

At the moment there are no concrete plans what goes into the next release.
I will be focusing on fully launching Lighthouse and crowdfunding for
decentralisation/crypto related projects, so I won't be doing any major
feature work on bitcoinj. Luckily it's become quite an active project now
and there are lots of contributors, so things won't stand still.

If I were to tackle a big project the next one would not be privacy
related. It'd be refactoring the wallet so it doesn't store transactions
directly anymore, just unspent outputs. Bitcoinj has always been largely
driven by the needs of Andreas' mobile app, and right now the top user
reported problem there is people hitting the scalability limits of the
current design (e.g. they are mining directly into their phone's wallet).
