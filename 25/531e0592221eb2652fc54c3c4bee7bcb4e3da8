This seems like a good place to point out that attempts to identify
individuals (either by name or simply as an individual human being) are
futile as well as destructive.  "1%" usually means "one out of every 100
people" but this requires identification of individuals as individuals.
One person can look like many in Bitcoin, which is why such an effort is
futile.  Additionally, one person may be far more affected by a decision
than others, which is why it's destructive.

I like the idea of measuring consensus, and there are proto-ideas in my
head about how that can be done, based not on individual people, but on
amounts of bitcoin.  Many will argue that we don't want the system to be
controlled by those who hold the most bitcoin.  I understand that
sentiment, but A) I simply disagree, and B) Finding something better seems
impossible to me.

A simple method is the following:
A message can be constructed saying: "As of block X, the holder(s) of Y BTC
controlled by [public key] agrees that Z," where X, Y, Z, and the [public
key] are the only things that change.  This message can be signed by the
private key matching the [public key] in the message.  Anyone interested in
measuring consensus on anything relative to bitcoin holders can advertise
for such signed messages to be sent to a repository of their choice which
would validate each message (that [public key] (still) holds Y BTC and that
the signature is valid) and provide a measure of agreement about Z.  Change
your mind?  Just move your BTC to a different address.
