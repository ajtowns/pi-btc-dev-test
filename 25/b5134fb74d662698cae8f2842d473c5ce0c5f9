As has been mentioned there have been a lot of time to upgrade
software to support segwit. Furthermore, since it is a softfork, there
will be plenty of time after activation too for those taking a "wait
and see" approach.

You keep insisting on "2 months after activation", but that's not how
BIP9 works. We could at most change BIP9's initial date, but if those
who haven't started to work on supporting segwit will keep waiting for
activation, then changing the initial date won't be of any help to
them can only delay those who are ready and waiting.

The new features are not a requirement after activation. And although
it may take some time after activation for the new features to really
get to the users, that's just a fact of life that won't change by
changing the initial BIP9 date.
