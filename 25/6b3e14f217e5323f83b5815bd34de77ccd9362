Likewise, including any kind of information that would allow a determination of whether the secret has been correctly reconstituted would give an adversary too much information. Failing silently when given incorrect shares or an insufficient number of shares is intentional.

I do not believe this is a good tradeoff.  It's basically obfuscation of
something that is already considered secure at the expense of
usability.  It's much more important to me that the user understands
what is in their hands (or their family members after they get hit by a
bus), than to obfuscate the parameters of the secret sharing to provide
a tiny disadvantage to an adversary who gets ahold of one. 

The fact that it fails silently is really all downside, not a benefit. 
If I have enough fragments, I can reconstruct the seed and see that it
produces addresses with money.  If not, I know I need more fragments. 
I'm much more concerned about my family having all the info they need to
recover the money, than an attacker knowing that he needs two more
fragments instead of which are well-secured anyway.
