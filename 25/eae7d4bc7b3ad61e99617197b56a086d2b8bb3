I agree that it seems like a safe assumption that adoption would be faster,
whether it is "very safe" and "significantly faster", whether it will be 6
times faster, all of those assumptions seems significantly less safe and
robust to me.

The nature of the bitcoin protocol, that it is a decentralized census based
protocol involving currency, suggests to me that roll out schedules ought
to be conservative with a minimum of assumptions. In light of the most
recent protocol upgrade, 6 months for this hard fork seems to me to be the
most conservative time frame with the fewest assumptions.

As for why it needs to be so fast, ie what are the dangers of it being as
slow as 6 months?

Gavin writes:

"I strongly disagree with the statement that there is no cost to a longer
grace period. There is broad agreement that a capacity increase is needed
NOW."

~~
"Broad agreement", that really seems to be another assumption, the fact
that the debate has been as long and acrimonious as it has been suggests
that there isn't broad agreement. Also, resorting to "SHOUTING" doesn't win
any favors when it comes to engaging in reasonable discussion om the
technical merits of a proposal.
