Cool.  ACK on adding your seed to the ref client.

Correct.

That's fine.  The main point was to create something scripted and
repeatable.  Then pnSeed[] becomes easier to maintain _and_ easier to
audit.  Right now it is a bit opaque with a list of hex constants.  A
script or makefile rule could do

     cd src
     ../contrib/gen-seeds.py > seeds.h

and seeds might look like

  #ifndef __SEEDS_AUTOGEN_H__ etc.

  unsigned int pnSeed[] = {
    0xABCD1234, /* IP addr 12.34.56.78 */
  };

I think Satoshi liked them opaque and not easily searchable, so
printing the readable IP address in a comment may not be desired.
Anyway, that output would make updating the list more transparent and
easy to maintain.
