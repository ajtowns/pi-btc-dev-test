Standard Disclaimer: Digital asset transfer systems are fundementally
fancy accounting systems; no amount of code can, by itself, make data
represent a physical or legal entity. Only consensus and/or authorities
in the "real world" can do that. Crypto-currencies are only a partial
exception to that rule, and only because a scarce asset that can be
transferred digitally appears to have potential to be broadly useful.

Those considering investing in or otherwise devoting resources to the
creation of digital asset transfer systems should be warned that their
value in general remains unproven and losing some or all of your
investment is very possible, even probable. I myself have doubts that
these systems serve real-world business needs, but the only way to find
out is to build them and see.

Anyway, the best we can do is build good tools. Dwelling on the
underlying metaphysical nature of what those tools may or may not do
from a social perspective is frankly off-topic on this email list.
