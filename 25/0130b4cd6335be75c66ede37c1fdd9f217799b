I don't think code quality is of a particular problem in alternate
implementations, the difficulty of getting it right is simply
astronomical.  If you attempt to re-implement just transaction
signature verification you run into edge cases remarkably quickly,
most use of Bitcoin today barely scratches the surface of what was
added to Bitcoin for future expansion.
