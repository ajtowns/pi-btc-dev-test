Good morning Dustin,

If Bitcoin had implemented RBF "properly" (i.e. not have the silly "opt-out" rule) then such races are won by bidding up the fees.  A random person who is not the original staker would be willing to pay miners a fee up to the entire staked amount minus dustlimit satoshis; obviously a staker would be far less willing to pay up such a fee, so the random person slashing the funds would have a major advantage in that race.
Thus the race will be won by whoever mines the highest-fee transaction.
It still becomes very unlikely that the staker will win unless the staker already has a significant mining hashpower (and if the staker has significant hashpower, then the Bitoin layer itself is at peril anyway, never mind sidechains built on top of it).

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
