Subject: [bitcoin-dev] TestNet block starved?
Message-ID: <CAJN5wHX1Uqwqbd0Q=DeMhpqn8AsdEfjWnrxc4p83tFfXb9Jnag@mail.gmail.com>

Any idea what's going on with TestNet?  No blocks for nearly 2 hours now,
according to multiple block explorers (blockr.io, my own bitcoin node, etc).

Prior to the last block (530516), there were a lot of blocks with zero
transactions and only an occasional block with a ton of txs.

Any info?

Thx,
-Danny
