Jorge, they'd have to be. Otherwise, assuming the price of the share goes
low enough, you could buy a share of the company, melt the gold plate, and
sell it for a profit. If the gold is part of the capital of the company,
the cheapest a share can be is the price of the gold on which the stock
certificate is printed.

This is why I think the importance of padding with colored coins is
overblown.
