Subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.6rc3 binaries available
Message-ID: <CABsx9T3B0hMfS5kL+RaKwRq5MO0Bfs2EJRrzS6pfNsk+DPjx3w@mail.gmail.com>

Version 0.6 release candidate 3 binaries are available at:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.6.0/test/

The big reason to run rc3 is to get the BIP30 security fix that takes
effect on March 15.

It also includes a fix to the problem of running rc1, upgrading, and
being stuck on the wrong block-chain fork
