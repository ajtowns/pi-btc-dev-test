But shouldn't your reasoning apply here so that ixcoin would be
destroyed by those who aren't even mining it. Because of the
"supposedly obvious" harm it does to Bitcoin through competition?

That's precisely my worry. Most of those guys planning to implement
random altcoins will conclude after reading you that what they need is
not merged mining but yet another independent scrypt coin, or worse,
yet another stupid PoW algorithm.

I'm approached many times with questions like "How much would it cost
to create a new altcoin?" (Thanks, BlueMatt for creating coingen!!).
I try to explain them that there's more currencies beyond p2p
currencies and they probably don't need that. I talk them about local
currencies, colored coins or open transactions as solution that
probably fit their needs much better without the need to bootstrap and
antire economy with a network of computer that consumes plenty of
resources.

If none of that fits them (say, for crazy experiments like datacoin or
gridcoin), I recommend them merged mining because is more secure for
them, more secure for bitcoin, and better for the environment and
everyone in general.

Still, for some reason a new non merged mined chain is the most popular choice.
Less efficient, less secure, more popular.
Why?
I wonder if devs warning against merged mining or making stupid
predictions like "bitcoin's PoW algorithm won't survive the year" have
anything to do with that...

The harm TO THE MINERS alone (again, assuming they have any position
at all in the coins they're mining) is less than the "total harm" to
the competing system, assuming that's quantifiable at all.
Miners won't think about the "total harm", but only about their share
of harm vs their share of just mining the competing system alongside
with the old one.

Yeah, true, they will only mine if all those costs are lower than the
reward. Only the hashing is "for free".
I'm assuming that those costs are very small compared to the reward,
that is, that most of the reward pays for hashing and not validation.

Not exactly, a less secure chain can become completely useless due to
the lack of security.
What I'm saying is that a useless chain is still useless no matter the security.

It is possible.
At least now we know each other position in MM.
I'm not sure if the silence means that only Maaku and Luke-Jr agree
with me on merged mining, that it is you who are more alone than me on
this one, or if it's just that not many people had taken the time to
think about this...
