Jeff elaborated the problems very well, but I just want to add this:

Your change is essentially relying (trusting) the server to track a piece of information (your state). Anytime you start depending on another node in some way, it is opening yourself up to be exploited. Nodes should be doing their owning state maintainance, not relying on external parties.


I am very much against the change. As someone who has implemented the complete bitcoin protocol, I had no problems implementing the blockchain download. In fact, I dislike that nodes have to store the last inventory they sent as part of a getblocks in order to trigger the next round. It's be better if there was no state whatsoever.

If the peer is misbehaving, then disconnect.? Your protocol change
does not offer any clear benefits in this area, as these sorts of
attacks/misbehaviors/bugs are still just as possible, and just as
damaging (or not).

Just disconnect the strange peer!

Stateless protocols have a lot of value.? They are easiest to
implement, and easier to prove correct.? Existing clients like
ArtForz' half-a-node, variants of which are deployed all over the
place in bitcoin-land, rely on the stateless-ness to one degree or
another.

Stateful protocols, too, have their problems as well.? One must add
code to help remain "synchronized" between local and remote states,
which your suggested change only hints at.? NFSv4 and RPC have a long
history of dealing with stateful-ness issues.? Obviously bitcoin P2P
is nowhere near as complex, but the history of NFS development offers
several lessons applicable to your proposed change.

Overall, IMO your listed reasons for needing this major change
(stateless->stateful) do not really justify the change.? Handling
initial block download can be accomplished in a number of ways, and
peer(s) may crash or return odd results.? You must handle these cases
properly, regardless of the presence of req/reply id's.
