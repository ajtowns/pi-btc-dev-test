I'm not convinced of the necessity of this idea in general, but if it
were to be implemented I would recommend serializing the nVersion field
as a VarInt (Pieter Wuille's multi-byte serialization format) and using
the remaining space of the 4 bytes as your extra nonce.

That would allow serialization of numbers up to 0x1020407f (slightly
over 28 bits) before the 4-byte field is exhausted. For version numbers
less than 0x204080 there will be at least one byte of padding space left
over for extra-nonce usage (two bytes if less than 0x4080, three bytes
if less than 0x80). For version values up to 127, the format is exactly
identical when the padding bytes are zero.
