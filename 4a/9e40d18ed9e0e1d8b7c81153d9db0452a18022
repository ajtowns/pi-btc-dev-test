There can be multiple independent transport networks for Bitcoin.

There already is: ipv4, ipv6, Tor, and native_i2p (out of tree patch).

As long as multihomed hosts that act as bridges then information will propagate across all of them.

The free-market capitalist nodes will want to charge their peers and will kick and ban peers that don't pay up (and will pay their peers to avoid being kicked and banned themselves), whereas the socialist nodes will want all of their peers to feed them transactions out of the goodness of their hearts and will thus necessarily be relegated to connecting only to other altrustic peers. Thus, the network will comprise two incompatible ideological camps, whose nodes won't interconnect.
