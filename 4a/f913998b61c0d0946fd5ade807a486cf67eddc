It certainly wouldn't hurt if there was a way to use OP_MULTICHECKSIG 
with hash160 values instead... I doubt that's workable, though.

At the moment, I feel that the copy&paste size problem is much smaller 
than the risk we take implementing such a huge change to the network.  I 
almost feel like, we should have multi-sig in place, thoroughly tested 
and available, as something to fall back on if something goes wrong with 
BIP 13/16/17 after implementation.  After all, I've been promoting the 
idea of considering the "cost" to fixing an erroneous/insecure 
implementation, as consideration for the proposals at hand.

But gmaxwell has expressed some compelling reasons why plain multi-sig 
might be abused, which maybe suggests we don't want it ever considered 
standard...?  I guess I'm not really promoting one thing or another, but 
I feel like copy&pasting is not a big deal (after all, it exists to 
moving large amounts of data around).  Then of course, I use 
home-shift-end all the time, and regular users may not be so adept at 
copying long strings.
