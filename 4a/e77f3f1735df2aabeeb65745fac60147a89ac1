There are so many things wrong with this paragraph I just can't let it
slide.

"Mainstream usage will be enabled primarily by..."  Maybe. Maybe not, we
don't know what use case(s) will primarily take cryptocurrency mainstream.
I believe it is a big mistake to pick one and bet "THIS is going to be the
winner".

"we can address it either by... or..."  False dichotomy. There are lots of
things we can do to decrease costs, and a lot of things have ALREADY been
done (e.g. running a pruned full node).  I HATE the "it must be this or
that" "us or them" attitude, it fosters unproductive bickering and
negativity.

(and yes, I'm human, I'm sure you can find instances in the recent past
where I did it, too... mea culpa)
