Math should decide the max block size, not humans (miners in this
case). The goal of Block75 is to manage the max block size without any
human intervention.

Under Block75, miners don't have any direct control but could still choose
to mine smaller blocks (same as now), though doing so would cost them the
fees from transactions they didn't include in their blocks.

A maximum block size is necessary to prevent a single nefarious miner from
creating a ridiculously large block which would break the network.

- t.k.
