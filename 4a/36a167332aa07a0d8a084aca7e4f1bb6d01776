They discuss a very old version of the Cuckoo cycle paper, and I
believe none of their analysis is applicable to the most recent
revision. :(

In any case, I commented more about functions of this class here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3n5nws/research_paper_asymmetric_proofofwork_based_on/cvl922x

I don't believe changing the POW function is impossible in principle,
but I expect it would only happen due to problems with the composition
of current hash-power and not even if it were universally agreed that
some other construction were technically better (though that is a high
bar.)
