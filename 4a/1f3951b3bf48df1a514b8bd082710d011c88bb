I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not, but if you aren't, I don't
think this is an accurate description at all. BIP75 is, at its most
simplest, nothing more than an encrypted/encapsulated version of BIP70. All
we did was make it safe for people to exchange BIP70 messages through an
intermediary.

The only identity information included in BIP75 is the pki_data field,
which wasn't even introduced in BIP75--it was already in BIP70. I'm
guessing Peter would also have us remove BIP70 altogether?
