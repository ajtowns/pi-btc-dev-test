I swear, I'm getting alzheimers or something. This and stealth addresses
is now the second time I've totally forgotten I had just read an idea a
week prior:

Reddit user RubenSomsen, ten days ago:

"I would really like it if Mycelium allowed me to temporarily lock my
bitcoins in a 2-of-2 transaction with a potential buyer (of course with
nlocktime back to myself) so the network can start confirming the
transaction before we even meet."

Better explanation than mine too for someone wanting a quick intro.
