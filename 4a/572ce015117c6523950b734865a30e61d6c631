We don't form or need to form a great many connections.

We don't use UDP.

Yes, TCP has a congestion window too, still sometimes some poorly
designed or configured routers suffer from buffer bloat.

Adding our own UDP network stack involving a ton of exposed code
sounds like a great way to gain inadvertent bugs or backdoors.

But there doesn't have to be and shouldn't just be one network
transport for Bitcoin. You can gateway to other protocols and run them
in parallel.  I think it would be great for someone to go build an
alternative transport protocol to gateway to and see what useful
things they can accomplish.
