In this general signing-a-script context, I think a verifier might want to
see the time conditions under which it may be spent. The proof container
could include an optional nLockTime which defaults to 0 and nSequence which
defaults to 0xFFFF...

I took another look and there should definitely be a byte appended to the
end of the sig so that the encoding checks pass, but I think it might as
well be a 0x00 byte since it's not actually a sighash flag.
