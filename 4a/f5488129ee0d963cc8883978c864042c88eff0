Gavin has been very clear about the fact that he's on vacation. I'm not sure what you want Mike to say. It's obvious the Bitcoin Core developer pitchforks are out for him so there isn't really anything he can possibly say which will be constructively received on this highly adversarial and increasingly ridiculous charade of a mailing list. I feel as though they've made their case abundantly clear to anyone paying attention.

The community will weigh the independent merit of the two points of view and that community is not as naive and uninformed as everyone on this list likes to portray them to be. Your concern for companies' welfare is appreciated but I'm confident they can manage their own independent assessments of this matter as well as seek out enough varied expert opinions such that they can make an informed decision.
