This scheme would discourage people from attempting a Finney attack because
they would end up worse off if they did.

It would work but it's an ugly hack IMO. What do people do if they don't
have extra to pay when making a purchase? I have 200 mbtc and want to buy a
200 mbtc phone but I can't because I need 400 mbtc. Sucks for me.

I would much prefer the hassle of a green address notary than always having
to make sure I have double what I need to make a purchase.
