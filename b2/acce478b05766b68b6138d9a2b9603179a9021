If not spent immediately, they become invalid and are removed from UTXO. But I still think the best solution is a more flexible SIGHASH system, which doesn?t need CPFP at all.

I don't see any reason why UTXO pollution would be a special concern so long as
those outputs are subject to the same dust rules as any other output is.
