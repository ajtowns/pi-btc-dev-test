The contract between the buyer and seller is actually outside the Bitcoin network. Yes, a merchant that gets cheated could seek some other recourse in such an event?but the behavior you?re claiming as ?obviously correct? is NOT obviously correct.  In fact, there are arguments against this ?obviously correct? way even if we were to accept the premise that the signature implies a promise to pay (which I think many reasonable individuals would also dispute). For instance, by relaying conflicting transactions it makes it potentially easier for others to discover the double-spend attempt (of course, this requires wallets to not be lazy about this?perhaps such relays could be flagged or placed in a special message type).
