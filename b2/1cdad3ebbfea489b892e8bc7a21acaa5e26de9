If a project cannot be organized enough to run its own hosting/web presense/
counterintelligence/security that starts with installing an OS and patching
kernels, then it is really not wise for me to trust my financial future to
software written by such a group.

There is a great deal of 'work' that is really quite pointless, particularly
in regards to claims I see about security that are irrelevant unless you 
have the understanding that comes from operating and running your own 
servers. 

This includes running DDOS protection, so no cloudflare.

If bitcoin wants to become irrelevant, then by all means, continue to 
depend on github and all the unknown attack surface it exposes.

Those of us that do run our own servers will migrate to higher quality 
alternatives.
