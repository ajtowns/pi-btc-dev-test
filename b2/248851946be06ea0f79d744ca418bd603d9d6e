I've looked at the latest draft and am worried about the increased AVB
namespace usage.  Would it make sense to differentiate main/testnet in
the prefix byte instead of the AVB?  Perhaps aiming for ST rather than
TS.

I'm willing to fork it.
The maximum number of shares possible over GF(2^8) is 255.  That would
make M and x biases unnecessary.
