The purpose of PaymentACK is to give the customer reassurance that their
payment request has been received and will be processed (or not).

If it is syntactically incorrect or invalid in a way that the payment
processor can detect right away then a PaymentACK with a message saying
that there is a problem should be the response.

Waiting until confirmed is definitely not the right thing to do, but
waiting a few seconds to detect a 0-confirmation double-spend attempt
before sending back an ACK is fine.  The BIP is intentionally vague on how
long it might take to get an ACK, but, again, the intent is to give the
customer reassurance that their payment was received and is being
processed, whatever "processed" means (order sent to shipping for
fulfillment, or awaiting 11 confirmations, or "your burger is paid for you
can leave the restaurant and we won't chase after you").
