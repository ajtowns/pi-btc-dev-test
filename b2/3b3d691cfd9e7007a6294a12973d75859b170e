Subject: [bitcoin-dev] What is OpenSSL still used for?
Message-ID: <CADToNK--p5FBxCKXGbab4sa_uOkWL=GxcNKA8f6Dgcz+NE0BMg@mail.gmail.com>

In the release notes for 0.12, it says that we have moved from using
OpenSSL to libsecp256k1 for signature validation. So what else is it being
used for that we need to keep it as a dependency?

Thanks,
Andrew
