The general case doesn't require transmission of any merkle data; it is derived from the tx data. Equally changing a data format is certainly: note how Freimarkets has no third-party library support because you've made it incompatible with the standard Bitcoin data structures. Merkle radix tree formatting OTOH is just a cryptographically committed extension of the tag-value concept seen in protobuf, among others.

re: efficiency, we need fundamental improvements in efficiency, not little micro-optimisations everywhere done at high cost to maintainability.

re: validation, note how the merkle radix tree meets that need by allowing the absence of data to be proven.

It's also rather useless without consensus. Expiry is only useful if it is a guarantee, if not you might as well just implement tx replacement directly.
