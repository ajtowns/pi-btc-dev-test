I think it would be wise to figure out HD wallet changes before trying to 
extend message signing. For privacy/safety, it would be a good idea to avoid 
signing with the same private key twice under any circumstances, so it might 
make sense to create a new address format the represent a chain of keys 
instead of one key or combination of keys.
