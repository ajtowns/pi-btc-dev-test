Then I only care about the hard cap (for example, to me bip100 is
practically equivalent to just raise the limit to 32 MB directly).
Miners can always produce smaller blocks by modifying their local policy.
So if we need a maximum that cannot be altered by miners anyway, why
take the additional complexity of miners voting on a lower and
changing maximum size?

How expensive it is depends on the concrete function f(extra_nBits) =
extra_size_allowed
But the goal of that proposal is not to raise the size maximum
permanently, but rather temporarily allow bigger blocks when there are
spikes in demand (ie many fees to collect in unconfirmed
transactions).
Yes miners will ask that question to themselves, and the answer will
depend on the concrete function and on the fees of those extra
transactions.
The miner paying for the costs will get the gains: no tragedy of the
commons here.

I believe the tragedy of the commons actually happens with your
proposal. Why would I pay alone for something that benefits all
miners?

This seems to solve the tragedy of the commons problem with your
current proposal.
It would be like flexcap but instead of the change in size being
temporary, it affects the next maximum size permanently.
One thing to worry about is miners filling blocks with
pay-to-themselves garbage to avoid reducing the size when they don't
have enough attractive transactions to include (ie it may not be free
for the network for miners to vote on "maintain current size").

I still don't see the point in having a lower moving size maximum.
If 8 MB is mining-centralization-safe, let's move directly to 8 MB
without adding this seemingly useless extra complexity.
If it's not, mining voting on a lower moving maximum won't make it safer.

Once we have more objective tools (centralization metrics, simulators,
etc...) to determine whether or not a block size is
mining-centralization-safe for a given point in time (looking at
current centralization and current technology available), I don't see
the problem with repeating the equivalent of bip102 periodically
(every 2 years?) to adapt the size to better technology or lower
mining centralization.
It would be also helpful to have a tool to somehow measure "size
increase urgency" (ie right now free transactions get mined and blocks
aren't full or close to be full, I don't think the current general
sense of urgency on this matter is justified).

With all respect, I believe bip100 and this proposal are
over-engineering; and bip101 and bip103 (pieter's) are
overly-optimistic (in their exponential technological growth
assumptions).
