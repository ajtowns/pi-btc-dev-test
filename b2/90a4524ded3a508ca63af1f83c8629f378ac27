Remember that one of the goals of full-RBF is to explicitly reject the
idea that miners should have any obligation with regard to what they're
mining. I perhaps should say that explicitly in my BIP proposal; I say
it implicitly by pointing out how the BIP *doesn't* define an exact
standard, but rather only an suggests an implementation as a starting
point.
