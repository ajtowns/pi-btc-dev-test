But that's not what this proposal does. They have to pay the difficulty penalty merely for a *chance* at later being able to mine larger blocks.

Maybe this could be fixed by allowing miners to produce a larger-than-limit block *immediately* by paying a difficulty penalty. Then we can simply take the 80th-percentile block size in each 2016-block period as the nominal block-size limit in the next period.
