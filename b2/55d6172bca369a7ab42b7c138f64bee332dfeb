ok, also what is the reasoning behind serialising points using a compressed format before going into the hash function? I'm looking at the sec1-v2.pdf and the compression format is a little confusing.

I think the octet string for X is 32 bytes (using q = curve.order) and secp256k1 is a prime field so we follow step 2.2.1

There is no way to iterate over all strings. The intention is that a wallet application can detect a new account that becomes in use (e.g. during disaster recovery), so the accounts get assigned incrementing numbers.

I wouldn't mind adding the ability to do "non-standard derivations" using arbitrary strings, if this recoverability property is not desired.
