Could you expand more on how prefix trees could be used for
time-stamping and merged mining?

I'd be inclined to leave the unicode out of the code examples as many
editors and shells still don't copy-and-paste it nicely. Using it in BIP
documents themselves is fine and often has advantages re: typesetting,
but using it in crypto examples like this just makes it harder to
reproduce the results by hand unnecessarily.
