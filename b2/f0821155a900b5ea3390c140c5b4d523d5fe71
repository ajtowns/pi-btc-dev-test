I still think HTTPS should be used, at the minimum. Using HTTPS is 
standard to every website out there that deals with financials, even if 
it is not a perfect system. Why should Bitcoin adopt a more lax policy 
than everyone else?

I thought that JSON support was fairly common these days. I personally 
prefer XML in most cases, but since JSON is already used with the RPC, 
it seemed like a natural fit here. Binary data can be base64 encoded, 
although I'm not sure why you would need to send back binary in an alias 
response.

What exactly do you mean by "custom output script"?
