Gerrit is free if you can afford the admin(s) to maintain it.

http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/wiki/ShowCases

And yes, I'm volunteering to get paid to be the admin, especially if you
want a 'painless' log in with a github account feature, because it will
be very painful for me to unroll the damage if github is compromised.

My preference would be that we use the same ECDSA keys we secure our
bitcoins with to secure our access to the code review and source 
control systems.
