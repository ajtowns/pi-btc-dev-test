Does this functionality change peer selection?  If not, the preferred
signaling mechanism is probably the one in BIP 130.

Otherwise, I think the standard method for getting numbers has been to
write a BIP documenting the usage. I don't know if that is intentional
or just how things have previously happened; and I don't have much of
an opinion on it.
