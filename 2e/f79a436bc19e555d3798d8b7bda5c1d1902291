Mark,

You seemed interested in changing BIP 68 to use 16 bits for sequence number
in both the block and time versions, making time based sequence numbers
have a resolution of 512 seconds.

I'm in favor of this approach because it leaves aside 14 bits for further
soft forks within the semantics of BIP 68.

It would be nice to know if you're planning this change, and perhaps people
can hold off on review until things are finalized.

I'd cast my "vote" against BIP 68 without this change, but am also open to
being convinced otherwise.

What are other peoples opinions on this?
