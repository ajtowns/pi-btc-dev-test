These types of actions are immediately apparent to anyone who looks at 
the Bitcoin ecosystem (Bitcoin.org, Githib, Wiki, bitcointalk, etc.) and 
were readily apparent long before any block size debate.  It is almost a 
taboo subject and anyone who raises these types of issues is immediately 
labeled as a "troll."  These are the people who used to run around 
saying that Bitcoin development is "decentralized" because anyone can 
fork the code and now many of the same people claim a fork will destroy 
everything.

The problem is that a small group of highly irrational and inexperienced 
people (outside of the small and unusual Bitcoin ecosystem) have control 
over the majority of the resources.  I think over time the problem will 
even itself out but currently it is an obstacle in moving Bitcoin forward.
