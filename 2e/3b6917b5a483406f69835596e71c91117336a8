I think it is better not to use the coinbase, because it might collide
with other proposals, and because coinbase is not part of the block header.

I agree that a small set of standard threshold may be sufficient; a one
percent resolution is probably not needed. If we use 4 bits we can
encode 15 different thresholds + zero (meaning no support). For example
we can have all thresholds between 25% and 95% separated by 5%.

Using 4 bits per soft-fork proposal leaves enough room to fit 7
simultaneous proposals in version bits. That should be plenty.
