Some questions:
* why limit the number of matching transactions to 255?
* what does "each hash and key in the output script" mean exactly? what about the output script in its entirety?
* is sharing parts of the merkle branches not worth it?

I'm not in favor of stuffing too much into the version message, it already seems overloaded.
A byte with some bit-flags is fine by me - higher bits can later be added for other boolean
flags.
