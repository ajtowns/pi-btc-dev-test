You could get most of the best of both with a combination of the two: Have
the activation be a timestamp plus a certain number of blocks to come after
maybe about 100, which is more than enough to make sure all the games which
can be played with timestamps have passed but a small enough amount that it
doesn't add much uncertainty to wall clock time.
