Or you could flip the definition of your activation bit.  That would
avoid the inversion and put relative locktimes outside the realm of both
the MAX_INT and MAX_INT - 1 values.

It would also allow an explicit relative locktime of 0, which would help
applications avoid accidentally finalizing the whole transaction when
they only meant to not impose a relative locktime on one input.
