Sorry, perhaps I misinterpreted that question.  The estimates will be
dominated by the prevailing transaction rates initially, so the estimates
you get for something like "what is the least I can pay and still be 90%
sure I get confirmed in 20 blocks"  won't be insane, but they will still be
way too conservative.  I'm not sure what you meant by reasonable.  You
won't get the "correct" answer of something significantly less than 40k
sat/kB for quite some time.  Given that the half-life of the decay is 2.5
days, then within a couple of days.  And in fact even in the steady state,
the new code will still return a much higher rate than the existing code,
say 10k sat/kB instead of 1k sat/kB, but that's just a result of the
sorting the existing code does and the fact that no one places transactions
with that small fee.   To correctly give such low answers, the new code
will require that those super low feerate transactions are occurring
frequently enough, but the bar for enough datapoints in a feerate bucket is
pretty low, an average of 1 tx per block.  The bar can be made lower at the
expense of a bit of noisiness in the answers, for instance for priorities I
had to make the bar significantly lower because there are so many fewer
transactions confirmed because of priorities.  I'm certainly open to tuning
some of these variables.
