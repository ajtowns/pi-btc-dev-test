Thanks for the pointer! Good to hear there is finally a decent
documentation for HCE.

Good news: HCE offers the required dispatch ability -- they call it AID
(Application ID).

Bad news: It seems - at least CATEGORY_PAYMENT - very credit card centric.

HCE seems to cover only the payer side. I wonder if there is also an API
for "reader emulation" which we would need for apps to support the payee
side.

Since Android 4.4 market penetration is quite far off, I suggest we
focus on the already established NFC payment protocol(s) for now, it
works pretty well. I will investigate into IsoDep and HCE and see if we
can make it enhance usability.

Interesting side note: They recommend messages transmitted via NFC to
not exceed 1 KB in order for a snappy experience. This (again) questions
usage of bulky X.509 certificates in our payment request messages.
Bitcoin Wallet currently does not sign payment requests, so I could not
try how it would feel.
