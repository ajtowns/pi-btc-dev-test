Nah.  It reported multiple metrics. The "100,000" number was an mostly
useless metric that just counted the number of distinct addr messages
floating around the network, which contains a lot of junk.  They also
reported an actual connectable node count previously and while they
may have tweaked things here and there as far as I can tell it has
been consistent with the numbers they are using in the headlines now.
