I started without a BIP and the feedback I got is that I should to a BIP.
We cannot write all the code for all the wallets ; this is after all a
communauty project.
However we have and we will propose bounties for each wallet to support
natively the protocol.

Yes you are right. But if the concept of authenticating yourself gets
traction, they will probably do it.

My view on this is mainly about the UX and the fact everyone in Bitcoinland
has a wallet.
It's a approach leveraging this fact, with the possibility to build
interesting apps combining address auth and the blockchain.

I understand the problems related to multisig, contracts etc,
There is no such thing as a from address in a transaction, however many
services still take first tx as the return address.
People will always find way of building and doing stuff (cf the message in
the blockchain debate).

There is also the benefit of revocation with certificate and central
authority.

But, again, you already have a wallet and a Bitcoin address.
So if you add a simple auth protocol, people will use it at no cost.
