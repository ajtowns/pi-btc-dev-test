I think that's extremely short, even assuming there is no controversy about
changing the rules at all. Things like BIP65 and BIP66 already took
significantly longer than that, were uncontroversial, and only need miner
adoption. Full node adoption is even slower.

I think the shortest reasonable timeframe for an uncontroversial hardfork
is somewhere in the range between 6 and 12 months.

For a controversial one, not at all.
