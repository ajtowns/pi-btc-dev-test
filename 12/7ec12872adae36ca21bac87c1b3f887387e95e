Hi guys


Just wanted to let you know that Andreas' testnet Bitcoin Wallet doesn't
work because of fail in the peer discovery, and this caused us problems as
we cannot properly demonstrate my XBTerminal POS on the Bitcoin Conference.

Right now I'm booting up an own full node that I will set as trusted peer
in the Wallet settings, hopefully this will work. However this DNS
discovery problem is really a problem, even for testnet. Btw, I had
problems firing up the full bitcoind node also, of the same reason -
discovery failed. I had to ask Andreas to paste me his node list to
manually seed the nodelist.

So I've set up and will run a well connected testnet node, as we need it
for the XBTerminal.
Please let me know if I can somehow help to fix the DNS discovery issue
also.


Best regards,
Alex Kotenko
