Well if you are bothering to draft up a BIP about that SIGHASH flag,
then perhaps also consider some other SIGHASH flag types as well while
you are at it?

Various proposed sighash types:

petertodd's reply about OP_CODESEPARATOR linked back to this thread
regarding "Build your own nHashType":

((That particular thread had other replies which can be viewed here:

))

Also, there was a draft implementation of SIGHASH_NOINPUT:

https://github.com/Roasbeef/btcd/commit/67830e506fa135d5239177340918cea39909e6a4

FWIW there was some concern about replay using SIGHAHS_NOINPUT or something:
