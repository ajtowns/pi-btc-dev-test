Unlikely. I doubt any significant portion of miners in china will continue to mine on a china-specific chain, since it will certainly be outmined by non-Chinese miners, and will be orphaned eventually. 

More likely is that mining interests in china will make special arrangements to circumvent the GFwOC.

Users who can't access the worldwide blockchain will notice horrendously slow confirmation times and other side effects.
