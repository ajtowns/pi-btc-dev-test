Indeed. I always use that look at and test and the merges locally
before pushing them. I never use the github merge button.

I'd recommend other people to do so as well - and as can be seen with
`git log --show-signature` it's common practice.

For browsing git history locally I find "gitk" to be a useful tool.

I'd absolutely encourage for more people to review code changes. Even
better if a few people do this through local tooling instead of the
web page. But my gut feeling is that hosting the code on github
results in many more eyes on the code overall than would be when
requiring *everyone* to use local tools. It's easy to let paranoia get
in the way of actual effectiveness.
