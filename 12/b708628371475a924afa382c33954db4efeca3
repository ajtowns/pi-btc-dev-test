Note how we can already do this: P2SH uses Hash160, which is
RIPE160(SHA256(d)) We still need a new P2SH *address* type, that
provides the full 256 bits, but no-one uses P2SH addresses yet anyway.

This will restrict data stuffing to brute forcing hash collisions. It'd
be interesting working out the math for how effective that is, but it'll
certainely be expensive in terms of time hashing power that could solve
shares instead.
