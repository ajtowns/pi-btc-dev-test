Also:

* There may be a desire to minimize the URL length when used in a QR code

* Some applications might specifically require some of the features of
the payment protocol - e.g. it may be a requirement that a print-media
QR code cannot be used after a cut-off date, or a vendor may have a
specific requirement not to accept payments without a refund address

There are pros and cons, but it's not clear to me that the benefits of
enforced backward compatibility outweigh the benefits of allowing
application designers to innovate as they see fit.
