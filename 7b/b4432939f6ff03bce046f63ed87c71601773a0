And this scheme could be generalised to the combinatorial settlement model in my earlier post.

Let?s say the settlement tx has 3 outputs: (A&B),(B&C),(A&C). There will be 4 versions of this tx:

tx-X: all 3 outputs are tagged, signed by all 3 parties
tx-Y-AB: output (A&B) is untagged, the other 2 outputs are tagged. Signed only by C
tx-Y-AC: output (A&C) is untagged, the other 2 outputs are tagged. Signed only by B
tx-Y-BC: ???

All 4 txs will have the same relative-lock-time

If C is missing at the time of settlement, A and B will settle upon tx-Y-AB with a simple signature

If B and C are missing, A will settle upon tx-X

However, I think this is just an overkill, and hardly improves fungibility. It is very clear that this is an uncooperative eltoo closing (due to the update tx of the main channel), and this is a multi-party channel (due to multiple settlement outputs). There is little doubt that the remaining parties would like to continue trading. So there is actually no secret to hide, and it might be easier to just tag all outputs

Nonetheless, this example shows that the fungibility impact of output tagging is quite manageable. Most likely you just need to prepare more versions of intermediate txs, and only use the tagged one when things go against you.

Therefore, a branch channel could be opened with the (A & B) output. The channel opening must use NOINPUT signature, since we don?t know the txid of the settlement tx. With the output tagging requirement, (A & B) must be tagged, and lead to the fungibility loss you described.

>> The branch channel is opened on top of the tagged output of tx X. If A and B want to close the channel without C, they need to publish the last update tx of the main channel. Once the update tx is confirmed, its txid becomes permanent, so are the txids of X and Y. If A and B decide to close the channel cooperatively, they could do it on top of the untagged output of tx Y, without using NOINPUT. There won?t be any fungibility loss. Other people will only see the uncooperative closing of the main channel, and couldn?t even tell the number of parties in the main channel. Unfortunately, the unusual long lock time of Y might still tell something.
>> 
>> If anything goes wrong, A or B could publish X before the lock time of Y, and settle it through the usual eltoo style. Since this is an uncooperative closing anyway, the extra fungibility loss due to tagging is next to nothing. However, it may suggest that the main channel was a multi-party one.
>> 
>> For C, the last update tx of the main channel and the settlement tx Y are the only things he needs to get the money back. C has to sign tx X, but he shouldn?t get the complete tx X. Otherwise, C might have an incentive to publish X in order to get the money back earlier, at the cost of fungibility loss of the branch channel.

>> To minimise the fungibility loss, we?d better make it a social norm: if you sign your tx with NOINPUT, always try to make all outputs tagged to be NOINPUT-spendable. (NOTE: you can still spend tagged outputs with normal signatures, so this won?t permanently taint your coins as NOINPUT-spendable) It makes sense because the use of NOINPUT signature strongly suggests that you don?t know the txid of the parent tx, so you may most likely want your outputs to be NOINPUT-spendable as well. I thought of making this a policy or consensus rule, but may be it?s just overkill.

Unfortunately, key-pair reuse has been a social and technical norm since the creation of Bitcoin (the first tx made in block 170 reused the previous public key). I don?t see any hope to change this norm any time soon, if possible at all.

The existing bitcoin script language is so restrictive. It disallows many useful smart contracts, but at the same time prevented many dumb contracts. After all, ?smart? and ?dumb? are non-technical judgement. The DAO contract has always been faithfully executed. It?s dumb only for those invested in the project. For me, it was just a comedy show.

Accidental double payment is not uncommon. Even if the payee was honest and willing to refund, the money might have been spent with a replayed NOINPUT signature. Once people lost a significant amount of money this way, payers (mostly exchanges) may refuse to send money to anything other than P2PKH, native-P2WPKH and native-P2WSH (as the only 3 types without possibility of NOINPUT)

The trigger tx, which spends the setup utxo, should be tagged, so the update txs could spend the trigger utxo with NOINPUT. Similarly, all update txs should be tagged, so they could be spent by other update txs and settlement tx with NOINPUT. As the final destination, there is no need to tag in the settlement tx.

That means we have to disallow NOINPUT in P2SH-segwit (Otherwise, *all* P2SH addresses would become ?risky? for payers) This should be ok for eltoo, since it has no reason to use P2SH-segwit in intermediate txs, which is more expensive.

However, it is somewhat a layer violation and you could only tag all or none output in the same tx. Also, as Bitcoin Core has just removed the tx version from the UTXO database, adding it back could be a little bit annoying, but doable.

If the wallet always uses a randomised tx version, it makes accidental replay very unlikely. However, that will burn a few more bits in the tx version field.
