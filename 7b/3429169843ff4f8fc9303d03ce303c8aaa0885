Can anyone summarize the current status of the bounty? I see nothing 
definite about the bounty in that thread from the beginning of January 
2014, other than that the multisig address continues to accumulate 
bitcoins. Meanwhile, on other mailing lists, I've seen some talk about 
paying a portion or the whole of the bounty to the Dark Wallet team.
