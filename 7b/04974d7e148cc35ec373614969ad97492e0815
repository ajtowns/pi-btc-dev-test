Aside: But is Bitcoin Core a well-suited application for those uses? I
cannot imagine someone running a full node on a stateless system.

Anyhow: As this is only one symbol, we can probably get rid of it (as
we didn't use it in 0.8.6?), or put it behind some #ifdef
COMPATIBILITY_BUILD...

Another option: Instead of statically building it'd be easy enough to
build against the 4.6 Qt headers instead without even swapping the
library. Qt is, after all, forward-compatible - between the 4.x
versions. This will lose some GUI features but if compatibility is
more important here that's a choice that can be made.
