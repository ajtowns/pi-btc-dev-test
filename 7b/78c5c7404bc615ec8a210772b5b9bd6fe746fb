That's what cross-platform abstraction libraries are for. Both Java and Qt
provide a key store library that can load from either the OS root store or
a custom one. If your chosen app platform doesn't, OK, then you'll have to
make or find one yourself. Perhaps contribute it upstream or make it a
library. But that's not a limitation of BIP70.

Just as a reminder, there is no obligation to use the OS root store. You
can (and quite possibly should) take a snapshot of the Mozilla/Apple/MSFT
etc stores and load it in your app. We do this in bitcoinj by default to
avoid cases where BIP70 requests work on some platforms and not others,
although the developer can easily override this and use the OS root store
instead.

Of all possible solutions, using a third party service to convert things to
JSON is one of the least obvious and highest effort. I don't know anyone
else who arrived at such a conclusion and respectfully disagree that this
is a problem with the design choices in BIP70. It sounds like a bizarre
hack around lack of features in whatever runtime you're using.
