	Summer of Code
Message-ID: <517E8417.50400@privacyfoundation.de>

Crypto Stick is an open source USB key for encryption and secure
authentication.
We have been accepted as a mentor organization for Google
Summer of Code (GSOC) 2013. One of our project ideas is to develop a
physical BitCoin wallet according to
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_card_wallet

If you are a student interested in working on that idea - this is for you.
You can apply for a project with us and if accepted our mentors will
work with you over
the summer and Google will sponsor you USD 5000 during that time.
Please check out our ideas page at
https://www.assembla.com/spaces/cryptostick/wiki/Ideas or suggest your
own idea. And, join our mailinglist to discuss it:
https://lists.crypto-stick.org/mailman/listinfo/dev
Your applications should be submitted through Google Melange
(https://google-melange.com) until 3rd May!

You can continue to submit additional information and comments into
the system after your initial application submission.

In order to participate in the program, you must be a student in an
accredited institution or university.
