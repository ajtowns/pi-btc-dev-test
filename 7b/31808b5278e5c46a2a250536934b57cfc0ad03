I'm sure that there are many but my Google Search-Fu is not strong enough
to build a query to identify how widespread they are.

Maybe once we have sufficient evidence to support the suspicion we should
post to the main developer forum asking for a cleanup. After all, a Bitcoin
URI starting bitcoin://<address> doesn't actually make much sense because
there is no hierarchy in Bitcoin - it's flat with only an address being a
mandatory element.

I don't want to be all anal about this, but looking at RFC 3986 #10 (
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-10) it's pretty clear that
introducing a false hierarchy is breaking the specification since it
presumes the existence of a relative URI.
