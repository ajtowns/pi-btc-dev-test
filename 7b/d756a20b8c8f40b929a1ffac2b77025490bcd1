Michael,

Very interesting that you have tackled that off the radar.  I didn't
know anyone else was working on anything similar.  I'm sure you saw the
recent Armory-funding announcement, so understandably I have other
priorities in recent past and near future, but I think you should
connect with Mark Friedenbach about this topic.  He solicited donations
for working on my idea, and has been doing proof-of-concept for for the
last few months.  In fact, he was just looking for funding for another 3
months, and Armory Technologies, Inc, just offered up 50 BTC for him to
continue (@Mark, whoops, I haven't actually paid you yet; contact me to
work out details).

For now, my ability to participate directly is limited, but I am still
very interested to see the ideas developed further, as well as provide a
first test of this whole staging-area idea.  I devised it originally for
the UBC/Reiner-tree concept, but there's no reason it couldn't be used
for any other type of sweeping change to the protocol.
