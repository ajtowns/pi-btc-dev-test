This attack has an obvious signature: getting outworked on the same
block as the pool was trying to verify, and always by the same person.

So the goal is to prevent the attacker double-dipping by submitting
cycles to the pool, which if he
found a correct answer he could submit himself. I don't see how this
does that: if he finds a valid
block he finds a valid block. Only if the operator has a secret is
this prevented.

This further delays the finalization of a transaction. That's not a good thing.
