I'm not aware of a way to combine the setup and trigger transaction. The
trigger transaction was introduced in order to delay the start of the
timeouts until a later time, to avoid having an absolute lifetime limit
and having really huge timeout. If we were to combine the trigger
transaction with the setup transaction (which is broadcast during
channel creation), all of those timeouts would start counting down
immediately, and we could just skip the trigger transaction
altogether. It'd be more interesting to combine update and trigger
transactions in a sort of cut-through combination, but that doesn't seem
possible outside of Mimblewimble.

Cheers,
Christian
