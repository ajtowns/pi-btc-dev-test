Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Increasing regularity of block times?
Message-ID: <874mul9met.fsf@rustcorp.com.au>

Hi all,

        I've been toying with an algorithm to place a ceiling on
confirmation latency by allowing weaker blocks after a certain time.
Hope this isn't noise, but thought someone must have considered this
before, or know of flaws in the scheme?

Gory details:

Thanks,
Rusty.
