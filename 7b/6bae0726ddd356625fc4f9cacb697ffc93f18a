Excellent - Thanks for your response Jorge. This helps us plan out the
future upgrades properly.
Since I see 0.15 and 0.16 use block versions as 0x20000000, whereas the
current deployed codebase (based on bitcoin 0.9.4) makes versions
0x00000002 (as seen by a 0.15 client), it appears safe to activate soft
forks which require a minimum of version 3 and 4 blocks (0x00000003
and 0x00000004,
respectively). Would you agree?
