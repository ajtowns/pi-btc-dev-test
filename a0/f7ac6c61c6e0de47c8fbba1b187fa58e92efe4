You assume the value of a crypto-currency is equal to all miners, it's
not.

Suppose I create a merge-mined Zerocoin implementation with a 1:1
BTC/ZTC exchange rate enforced by the software. You can't argue this is
a scamcoin; no-one is getting rich. There's a 1:1 exchange rate so the
only thing you can do with the coin is get some privacy. But inevitably
some miners won't agree that enabling better privacy is a good thing, or
their local governments won't. Either way, they can attack the Zerocoin
merge-mined chain with a marginal cost of nearly zero.

OTOH if the Zerocoin scheme was implemented by embedding ZTC
transactions within standard Bitcoin transactions - even without any
attempt at hiding them - the attackers would need a 50% majority of
hashing power to succeed. Of course potentially slow confirmations is a
trade-off, but that's likely a perfectly OK trade-off in this case.
