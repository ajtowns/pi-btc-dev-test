...or should we be directing people to a (vetted) list of cloud services -
I think this has a significantly lower entry cost than any client. I know
the mybitcoin debacle has clouded (pun intended) people's views of these

cost of entry, cross platform support and what appears to be very good
security (e.g. two factor)
