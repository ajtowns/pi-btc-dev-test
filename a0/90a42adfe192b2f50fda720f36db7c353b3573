The number one user of the blockchain as a storage and transport mechanism
is Counterparty, and limiting OP_RETURN to 40 bytes didn't prevent them
from doing so. In fact they use multi-sig outputs which is worse than
OP_RETURN since it's not always prunable, and yet let them store much more
than 40 bytes.

For Open Assets <https://github.com/OpenAssets/open-assets-protocol>, we
need to store a URL in the OP_RETURN output (with optionally a hash) plus
some bytes of overhead. 40 bytes comes really short for that. The benefit
of having a URL in there is that any storage mechanism can be used (Web,
FTP, BitTorrent, MaidSafe...), whereas with only a hash, you have to
hardcode the storing mechanism in the protocol (and even then, a hash is
not enough to address a HTTP or FTP resource). Storing only a hash is fine
for the most basic timestamping application, but it's hardly enough to
build something interesting.

I've counted the number of OP_RETURN outputs in the blockchain for the
month of October 2014. There were 1,674 OP_RETURNs for a span of 4,659
blocks. Assuming they were all 40 bytes (the average is probably less than
half of that), that means an increase of 14.37 bytes per block. Considering
a 1 MB block, that's about 0.0013% of the block used up by OP_RETURN data
in average.

Increasing to 80 bytes will have a negligible impact on bandwidth and
storage requirements, while being extremely useful for many use cases where
a hash only is not enough.
