Hi, have you checked out databases like OKFN and searched for existing
vocabularies for payments? I don't think it's a great idea to
re-invent it, if there is already some existing protocol.

random search gave me that:

http://schema.org/PaymentMethod

http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#PayPal << adding
something right here for bitcoin!? (diners club and similar also exist
there)

payment relationships:
