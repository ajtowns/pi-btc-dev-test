It was written with bitcoind/Bitcoin-Qt in mind, which don't work on BSD. :p

It should be portable to other systems, though hasn't been done yet.
Would be nice if the concepts it uses could be integrated into the package-
building systems.

The problem is that we require bugs. That is, if your library has those bugs 
fixed, you have introduced a security vulnerability.

There is no configure-time for this node software yet. The autoconf-based one 
in the works *does* make this check, however.

The review process is very slow and strict, but that is because of the same 
reasons it isn't safe to distribute patched versions in general. Merging your 
patches to mainline is not only a good idea, but it helps to ensure they get 
the necessary testing needed to be safe.
