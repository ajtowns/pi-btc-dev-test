This actually sounds very similar to what happens with Apple iPhones.. they somehow manage to 'invalidate' the charging cables and accessories with every major software version.  One day an accessory is working fine, then after the update users get a behavior modification nag every time they use it, urging them to buy a new one.  Along these same lines, might as well put a warning about the registry keys needing to be cleaned, and maybe a 'shock the money' banner[1].

the server?  Sooner or later, the vulnerabilities must be faced.
