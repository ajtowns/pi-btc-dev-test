Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin API Wrapper
Message-ID: <5458EA79.4040600@googlemail.com>

Dear everyone,

I've developed a C++ wrapper for JSON-RPC communication with
an existing Bitcoin installation. For everyone that is a developer and
interested in building extensions or alike, this might prove useful.

The code can be found on GitHub:
-> https://github.com/minium/bitcoin-api-cpp

Warm greetings,
Krzysztof
