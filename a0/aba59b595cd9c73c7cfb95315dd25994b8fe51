Feel free to come up with wordlist enhancements. That's why we put
this BIP for discussion in the first place. Three people went through
the wordlist numerous number of times and as you can see it's still
not perfect.

Please bear in mind that for every word you remove from the list, you
have to come up with a good alternative that is unique and hard to
confuse with the others.
