I agree giving notice that the change is going to happen is critical for a
hard fork.  If miners vote in favor, they need to give people time to
upgrade (or to decide to reject the fork).

The BIP 100 proposal is that no change will happen until a timestamp is
reached.  It isn't clear exactly how it would work.

Testnet: Sep 1st 2015
Mainnet: Jan 11th 2016

It suggests 90% of 12000 blocks (~83 days).

This means that if 10800 of the last 12000 blocks are the updated version,
then the change is considered locked in.

I think having an earlier "fail" threshold would be a good idea too.  This
guarantees notice.

Assuming 3 is <old rule> and 4 is <new rule>

If the median of 11 timestamp is after 1st Sep 2015 and less than 10800 of
the last 12000 blocks are version 4+, then reject version 4 blocks
If the median of 11 timestamp is after 1st Nov 2015 and at least 10800 of
the last 12000 blocks are version 4+, then reject version 3 blocks
(lock-in)
If the median of 11 timestamp is after 1st Jan 2016 and at least 10800 of
the last 12000 blocks are version 4+, the allow <new rule>

This means that if the 90% threshold is lost at any time between 1st Sep
and 1st Nov, then the fork is rejected.  Otherwise, after the 1st Nov, it
is locked in, but the new rules don't activate until 1st Jan.

For block size, miners could still soft fork back to 1MB after 1st Nov, it
there is a user/merchant revolt (maybe that would be version 5 blocks).
