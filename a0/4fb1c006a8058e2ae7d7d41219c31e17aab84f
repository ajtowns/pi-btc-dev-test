BIP50 was an accident, and my proposal is just for a planned hardfork. You can?t anti-replay if you don?t even know a hardfork might happen. And I think your hypothesis (replay reduces the incentive of split) is not supported by the ETC/ETH split.

Aside the philosophical argument, your proposal is not technically feasible. In my understanding, you require the new chain to replay all the txs in the old chain. But this is not possible because there could be orphaning in the old chain, and different miners of the new chain may see a different history of the old chain. Not to mention that mining is a random process, and the hashing power is going up and down. Just by chance, 10 blocks might be generated in the old chain while no block is generated in the new chain. This is also unfair to the new chain miners, as they may not satisfied with the fees paid while they are forced to include those txs from the old chain (remember that people may just pay the old chain miners out of band, and pay no fee in the transaction)

I don?t think these technical issues are solvable when both forks are decentralised mining. If time machines, for example, are not technically feasible, there is not much point to talk about the benefits of time machines.
