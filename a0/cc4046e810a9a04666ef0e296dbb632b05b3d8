Huh? No... This is not a Bitcoin Core issue, it is a Bitcoin protocol one and should be discussed here, not on github.
I really appreciate Ittay and Emin's efforts in this space and their willingness to work with the Bitcoin community on it! It seems it still needs some tuning, but seems like if the pool-mining issues were resolved it could make block relay times irrelevant, at least.
