Your release announcement does not make it clear that Bitcoin Classic is
incompatible with the current Bitcoin network and its consensus rules. It
is a hard fork on mainnet with no safe activation as well as including
other unsafe changes. There is also no BIP for the hard fork. There is also
no evidence of community wide consensus for such a hard fork. This is
dangerous and irresponsible.


It's wrong to announce software without correctly informing people about
the contents or risks. Furthermore, there are no release notes in
https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/tree/v1.2.0/doc nor
changelog. Without those, it is almost impossible for average users to know
what is under the hood or what has changed and time consuming for
developers to assess.
