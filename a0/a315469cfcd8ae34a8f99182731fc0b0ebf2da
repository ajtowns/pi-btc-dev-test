You can't solve DoS by requiring all clients to do complicated work, all
that means is that weak clients (like users mobile phones and tablets) are
successfully DoSd whereas the attackers botnet of stolen computers sit
there solving PoWs.

The correct way to solve DoS is by having work prioritisation and queueing
mechanisms, then finding ways to distinguish "good" clients from "bad"
clients. Doing this whilst preserving privacy is hard. Long term the only
way to solve it may be to require clients to present some kind of cookie
during resource exhaustion events that prove they've been around for a
while, thus allowing them to jump the queue.
