Subject: [bitcoin-dev]  Possible change to the MIT license
Message-ID: <PS2P216MB01795F951980A6681D81582B9DF50@PS2P216MB0179.KORP216.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

I do not know that Bitcoin's position is any weaker because of the terms that the software is licenced under.

I disagree completely with any licence change. As well as allowing for the use of a software, a licence is also a disclaimer for those responsible for the release. Changing a single word can have drastic implications should there ever be any action considered against any involved party or group. The current MIT licence is IMHO the right fit.
