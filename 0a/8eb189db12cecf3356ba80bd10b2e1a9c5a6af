I gave the small miners collectively the same hashrate as the large
miners in the original test.  I made them well-connected because
everyone was well-connected intra-partition in the original test.

I just varied one thing: the size of the miners.  This is a principle of
experiment design, in science.

Next you'll probably claim that second-order and cross-term effects
dominate.  Maybe you can find the time to prove it.
