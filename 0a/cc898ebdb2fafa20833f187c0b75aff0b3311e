No, this is not correct at all.  RPC keepalive was present in 0.7.0,
possibly earlier.

Come on, it took a 30 second 'git checkout' session to verify this.

I was about to flame you with a "WTF is this fiction?" but it seems
true: 21eb5ada introduces this.

Unfortunately, it does so erroneously, introducing clearly buggy
behavior that did not exist with the thread-per-connection code that
provided keep-alive before commit 21eb5ada.

In my opinion, 21eb5ada half-changed the RPC code from
thread-per-connection to a worker-group model, without considering all
the consequences.
