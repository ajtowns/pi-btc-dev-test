I've advocated for this in the past, and reasonable counter-arguments I
was presented with are: (1) bittorrent is horribly insecure - it would
be easy to DoS the initial block download if that were the goal, and (2)
there's a reasonable pathway to doing this all in-protocol, so there's
no reason to introduce external dependencies.
