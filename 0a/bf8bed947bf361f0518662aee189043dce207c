True and the more complicated fields, like a digital signature, are optional. Are you suggesting BIP-70 payment requests should be rendered with bech32? How long would those be if it's just the address and expiration date?

Do tools that generate BIP-70 payment requests generate addresses themselves or are those input manually by a user? In the former case, I assume it could avoid setting the optional expiration date?

Is it not allowed to scan the date even if it then sets the expires field to the same (redundant) value?
