Our "identities" aren't pseudonymous.

In the case of Bitcoin, there's something like 6,000 nodes, so if that

You're not talking about a Sybil attack anymore, just resource use. We do
know how to change default configurations to offer more connections.

If you are achieving that via incoming connections, you're placing a big

We're not Chainanalysis and we do not run hundreds of distinct nodes. Just
a few well-tuned ones.

That's a matter of opinion. One could argue your actions and control
attempts hurt decentralization. Either way, no one should play the
decentralization police or act as a gatekeeper.

Question: Do you have relationships with mining pools? For instance, are

No, we do not. We do not know anyone else having such contracts. As you
know, Coinbase also denied having such contracts in place [1]. But you seem
to have more relationships with mining pools than we do.
