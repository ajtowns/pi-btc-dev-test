Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 70 and OP_RETURN
Message-ID: <5335EC3B.6070605@silicon>

The description of the Output message states that the payment request
can specify any standard TxOut script, and that OP_RETURN is a standard
transaction type that would imply the ability to specify OP_RETURN
outputs in BIP 70 payment requests.

If the creator of a payment request wanted the sender to include a small
amount of data as an OP_RETURN output, how would they specify this?
