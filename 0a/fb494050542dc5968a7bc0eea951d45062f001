Thanks Stephen, I hadn't thought about BIP 34 and we need to address this
in both proposals. If we can avoid it I'd like not to have one transaction
hashed one way and other transactions in another way.

Since BIP 34 explicitly uses the scriptSig to make the coinbase transaction
unique, simply removing the scriptSig is not an option as it would
potentially cause collisions. I don't remember why the scriptSig was
chosen, but we also have the option of putting the blockchain height in the
sequence number of the coinbase input or the locktime of the transaction,
restoring the uniqueness constraint in normalized transaction IDs (for both
proposals). Is there a specific reason why that was not chosen at the time?
