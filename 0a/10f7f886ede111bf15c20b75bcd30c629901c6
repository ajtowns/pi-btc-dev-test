Not to mention the tiresome and error-prone task of writing your own
JSON-to-schema marshalling code -- or something equivalent to the protobufs
compiler and libs for JSON.

protobufs -- and its modern competitors such as msgpack -- natively provide
type support in a way that must be hacked into JSON or XML.

The protobuf/msgpack design is engineered to avoid bugs routinely found in
JSON parsing code; due to the amount of code & effort involved in JSON
input sanity checking, bugs and inconsistencies inevitable arise.  We have
seen this in bitcoind with JSON-RPC.
