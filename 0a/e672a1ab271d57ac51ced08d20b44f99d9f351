Yea, no problem since we lack covenants.

Or a least no problem making an example, maybe you'll find it too
contrived since I'm not sure what would motivate it:

You and I put 5 btc each into a kickstarter-escrow to pay Alice+some
oracle that decides if alice did her job.  But if a timeout expires
before alice manages to get the sign off the funds must be returned
completely to their original payers.

Returning them to in two outputs, one to me, one to you is trivial
with a pre-signed refund.

You could make there be multiple alice outputs or refund, but then you
can't guarantee an atomic reversal (e.g. maybe Alice gets half if we
race).
