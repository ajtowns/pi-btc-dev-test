Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Announcement: libcoin/BitcoinQt aka libcoinqt
Message-ID: <CC97C1E6-57C3-4EDA-A6E8-1389F03DD503@ceptacle.com>

I have just finalized porting BitcoinQt to build using libcoin as its basic crypto library.

You can find the project at:

https://github.com/ceptacle/libcoinqt

It is based on the latest 0.6 branch of BitcoinQt.

There are a few things not yet ported:
* update the splash text while loading
* some of the globals have not found a replacement (see optionmodel for details on this)
* UPnP - this awaits the similar functionality in libcoin
* Proxy support - same...

To build libcoinqt you need to first build libcoin, then build libcoinqt using qmake or Qt Creator.

Note: I have only tested on MacOSX - more tests and features next week.

Have a nice weekend!

Michael
