Absolutely not. Time and time again we've seen "anonymized" data sets
that dont work out so well. I'm sure its possible to do but there are
too many factors and we dont want to succumb to this.

Also, these generally look good (and essentially the same as what had
been a gentleman's agreement for those who read IRC actively, the
purpose of codifying this is essentially that we ended up adding a lot
of DNS Seeds run by people who dont follow development closely and/or
are not aware of the issues involved).

Thanks for writing this up,
Matt
