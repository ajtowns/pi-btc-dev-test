While I agree with the sentiment, to be fair one should acknowledge that
Bitcoin Core has intentionally implemented two hard forks since Nov
2015. The earlier is released, and I assume the latter will be.

Neither was subject to activation, or prior public debate (see Buried
Deployments threads):

There was at least some internal discussion about whether a BIP should
document the latter having occurred, and that question was put to the list:

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-November/013275.html

Some have argued that these are inconsequential changes. I disagree, as
the arguments is base on provably invalid assumptions. Nevertheless, if
hard fork is the threshold criteria here, Core has not met it.
