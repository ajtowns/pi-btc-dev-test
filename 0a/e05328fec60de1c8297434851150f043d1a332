I'm not sure why that's actually a problem.

CPFP is initiated by the recipient of the parent transaction, and so if
the recipient is creating this transaction in the first place they must
have a copy of the parent transaction which can/should broadcast at the
same time.

If the child reaches a CPFP miner, then presumably the parents made it
as well (any path between the sender and the miner that doesn't relay
the parent should reject the child as trying to spend non-existent
coins), so both of the transactions can be mined at the same time.
