People would also abuse this feature in the same way amazon (and other sales sites) abuse the definition of "save". For example, Amazon will indicate that you're getting x% off by shopping at amazon, but all that number really means is x% off MSRP. In reality, every website has the same price. I have no doubt that merchants would put similarly meaningless and/or misleading data in this field. 

I agree, the memo field is appropriate for this data.
