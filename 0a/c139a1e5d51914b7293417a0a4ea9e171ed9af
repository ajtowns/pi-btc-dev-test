1. If it only affects "old dust" UTXO's where the # of coins in the UTXO
aren't sufficient to pay some lower quantile of transaction fees, then
there can be little argument of theft or loss.

2. There's another use-case for demurrage as well.

Computation power may grow rapidly if quantum computing becomes more
common.  At some point, Bitcoin may have to change the public key format
for coins and the POW used.

In order to do this, old coins will have to transact on the network, moving
their value to a new format, with many more bits in the public key, for
example.   But since quantum computing isn't bounded by moore's law, so
this may need to be a regular upgrade every X years.   Rather than a
regular "bit widening hard fork", the number of bits needed in a public
address format could be scaled to the difficulty of the new quantum hashing
algorithm that *also must *now grow in the # of bits over time.   To ensure
that coins are secure, those with too few bits must drop off the network.
So the timing for old coin demurrage can effectively be based on the
quantum POW difficulty adjustments.   As long as the subsequent exponential
rate of computation increase can be reasonably predicted (quantum version
of moore's law), the new rate of decay can be pegged to a number of years.
