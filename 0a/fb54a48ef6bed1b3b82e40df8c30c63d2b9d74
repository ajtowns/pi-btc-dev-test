You have no position (i.e. neutral). In other words, keeping the existing
limit.

The degree of mining decentralization is only one of many concerns. Users'
main concern is timely confirmation of low-fee transactions. Miners'
concern is the amount of profit they make.

The limit won't even get to be hit, because all the users that get thrown
out of Bitcoin will have moved over to a system supporting a larger block
size.

I don't know where you get your "majority" from or what it even means

The majority which the miners are beholden to is the economic majority.

Your position is only one of many and it does not carry excess weight to
the others. Individually it won't matter, because you can't control the
implementation that other people run.

Don't fight the market. The way the system is designed, the miners will
follow along with what the economic majority have decided.

So if you say 8, I must ask, why not 9?

8MB has simply been the focal point for this debate. 9MB is also safe if
8MB is, but I suppose the opponents will be even less happy with 9 than
with 8, and we don't want to unnecessarily increase the conflict.

It seems like the rationale it's always "the bigger the better" and

A one-time increase to 8MB is safer than a dynamically growing limit over
time for exactly this reason. Admittedly whenever the next debate to
increase the block size over 8MB happens it will be even more painful and
non-obvious, but that is the safety check to prevent unbounded block size
increase.
