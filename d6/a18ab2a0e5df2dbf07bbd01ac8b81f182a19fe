With normal usage, the expected results would then be ~4 or 4.2MB blocks.

I think Calvin is correct here, the secondary limit is not what people
anticipated with the segwit + 2mb agreement.  It would not kill the
agreement for me, but it might for others.

What is the justification for the secondary limitation?  Is there hard data
to back this?  The quadratic hashing problem is frequently brought up, but
that is trivially handled with a hard 1mb transaction limit and on the
other thread there's talk/suggestions of an even lower limit.  Are there
any other reasons for this limitation, and is there data to justify those
concerns?  If not, this should be left out in favor of a transaction size
limit.  If so, hard data would go a long way to dealing with the conversy
this will create.

This is likely to cause more controversy and unfortunately has the tightest
timelines.  Unlike the SW2mb working group's timelines, a hard-coded
timeline couldn't be changed with mutual agreement from the signers.

Given the chance of bit1 accidental activation without clear signaling for
the required bit4 2mb hard fork, I don't think the fair or acceptable
tradeoff is for flag day to require bit1 signaling only.  *Flag day should
be modified to accept either bit1 signaling, OR to accept bit4 signaling IF
the 80% threshold hasn't been met.*  In this way the anti-segwit working
group members are not in danger of an activated bit1 segwit without also
getting their portion of the compromise, the bit4 signaled HF.  If flag day
accepts bit4 OR bit1, AND bit4 requires both bit1 and bit4 once 80% is
reached, flag day is nearly guaranteed to get its stated desire within 1750
blocks (bit4 accepted until block 800; bit4+bit1 signaled afterwards until
95%), but without the chance that the WG signers won't get what they agreed
to.

*That seems like a minor compromise for BIP148.  Thoughts on this change to
flag day / BIP148?*

In addition, the aggressiveness of the timelines and the complexity of the
merged COOP proposal may require the BIP148 flag day to be pushed back.  I
would think some day in September is achievable, but I'm not sure if August
1st will be.
