It's both consistent and credible for an agent to commit to honesty on a
chain that it openly supports and dishonesty on a chain that it openly
opposes. (Moral? Legal? Perhaps not.) That said, majority hashpower doesn't
need to be dishonest to stop a change to large blocks. It just needs to
refuse to build on blocks that it doesn't like. The minority isn't going to
mine blocks larger than 1MB if it knows they'll be orphaned.
