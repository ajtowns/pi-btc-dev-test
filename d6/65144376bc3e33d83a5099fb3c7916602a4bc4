Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Process: Status, comments,
	and copyright licenses

The section that starts "Should two software projects need to release"
addresses issues that are difficult to ascertain from what is written
there.  I'll take a stab at what it means:

Would bitcoin be better off if multiple applications provided their own
implementations of API/RPC and corresponding application layer BIPs?

   - While there is only one such application, its UI will be the obvious
   standard and confusion in usability will be avoided.
   - Any more than a single such application will benefit from the
   coordination encouraged and aided by this BIP and BIP 123.

"To avoid doubt: comments and status are unrelated metrics to judge a BIP,
and neither should be directly influencing the other." makes more sense to
me as "To avoid doubt: comments and status are intended to be unrelated
metrics. Any influence of one over the other indicates a deviation from
their intended use."  This can be expanded with a simple example: "In other
words, a BIP having  the status 'Rejected' is no reason not to write
additional comments about it.  Likewise, overwhelming support for a BIP in
its comments section doesn't change the requirements for the 'Accepted' or
'Active' status."

Since the Bitcoin Wiki can be updated with comments from other places, I
think the author of a BIP should be allowed to specify other Internet
locations for comments.  So "link to a Bitcoin Wiki page" could instead be
"link to a comments page (strongly recommended to be in the Bitcoin
Wiki)".  Also, under "Will BIP comments be censored or limited to
particular participants/"experts"?" You could add:

   - The author of a BIP may indicate any commenting URL they wish.  The
   Bitcoin Wiki is merely a recommendation, though a very strong one.
