What if we added another byte field OutputType for wallets that do not
follow BIP43?

0x00 - P2PKH output type
0x01 - P2WPKH-in-P2SH output type
0x02 - native Segwit output type

Would that work for you?

The question is whether this field should be present only if depth==0x00
or at all times. What is your suggestion, Thomas?
