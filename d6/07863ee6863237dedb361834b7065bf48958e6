Wait, forget this reply, I mixed up the two issues of keepalive and
definition of low, high etc... -.-

1. Keepalive for longpolling:
As I said, this can be useful for an out-of-date warning. I don't know
if this is better solved with TCP keepalive or on the higher layer.

2. Definition of low, high:
My feeling is that there is nothing wrong with providing exact
definitions in the BIP, i.e.., giving up the flexibility does not too
hurt much. However all of this is a minor issue after all.
