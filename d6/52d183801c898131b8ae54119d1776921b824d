Sure, that's a way to increase your net worth in real terms, but it only
works if your interest rate on your fiat account is greater than the
price rise in bitcoin over the same term. If you pull out a BTC today at
$300, put it in a bank account earning 3% interest for a year and then
buy $309 worth of bitcoin when the price has risen to $400 per BTC,
and only get 0.7725 of a bitcoin, that's not a winning proposition.
I'd call that earning a -22.75% rate (in bitcoin terms), while a 0%
rate would just be ending up with as many bitcoin after a year as you
started with. Note that in USD (and real) terms, in this scenario 77%
of a bitcoin is actually worth more after a year than 1 bitcoin is now.

You might get a positive rate of return on bitcoin invested today by
running an exchange or a gambling service of some sort; but I think
mostly, people are just sitting on their coins hoping they appreciate. If
so, (in my terminology at least) they're earning 0%, denominated in
bitcoin, and have a time-value of bitcoin of zero.
