I think you can do everything with the existing script level nlocktime
in some kind of turing completeness sense (maybe); but there is a
complexity cost that often you have to resort to extra dependent
transaction(s) (and work-around malleability until that is fully
fixed) just to get the effect.

When I tried building things that need nlocktime I found it quite
inconvenient that it was wasnt a function rather than a script
property, so I like this proposal.
