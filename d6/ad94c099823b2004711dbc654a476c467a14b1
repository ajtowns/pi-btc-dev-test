Jumping on this thread after reading it all. I am in favor of the
discount offered by the merchant.

Ideally the merchant could get the amount of the wallet *fee*
for instant payment (privacy leak?). That way, the merchant
could decide to support the instant payment at 100% (better
user experience after all) or at 50% only or at 0%.

This would encourage instant payment for merchants and buyers without
(re-)creating a non-transparent system.
