Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP0039 Mnemonic code for generating
	deterministic keys
Message-ID: <CAJna-HgXPNa2UCO_edBzK=oY5-F=6LQVHap1Vk9XtGr09chy9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

we just finalized the draft and reference implementation of BIP39. Regards
to rules in BIP0001 we're asking for comments.

The aim of the proposal is to standardize algorithm across various clients
and fix some design problems of existing (but not yet standardized)
Electrum mnemonic algorithm.

BIP39 is a nice complement to BIP32, which allow users to (paper) backup
and share their wallet accross multiple clients easily.

Thanks for your time,
slush
