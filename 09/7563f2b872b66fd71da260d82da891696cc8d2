Great summary, thanks.  Helpful to get general grasp of the main
things out there.

I'd like to add to this some remarks that are from an earlier discussion

Cameron Garnham added into a thread, at
http://bitcoin-development.narkive.com/iHmMh6bZ/bitcoin-development-prop
osed-alternatives-to-the-20mb-step-function#post65
"First off, I am glad that the idea of dynamic block size adjustment is
gaining some attention, in particular the model that I proposed.

I wanted to take some time and explain some of the philosophy of how,
and why, I proposed this this particular model.

When Bitcoin was first made, there was a 32MB block size limit; this
was quickly found to be open to spam (and potentially DOS, as the code
was not-at-all optimized to support large blocks), and was reduced to
1MB, this was a quick fix that was never intended to last; at some
point the network should come to an understanding, a consensus if you
will, of what (and how much) belongs in a block.
The core point of this is that miners have always, and will always;
hold the power, to decide what goes into blocks; this implicitly,
obviously, includes how large blocks are. Miners are able to come any
sort of agreement they wish, providing the bitcoin clients accept
their blocks as valid."
(...)
"the proposal introducing a consensus protocol for block sizes;
instead of just having a hard limit (enforced by everyone), instead,
we have a constant factor above the average block size over a fixed
intervals that is soft-forked by only the miners. (The next simplest
mathematical construct).
This proposal is entirely a soft-fork and may be implemented without
changing any client code what so ever. In-fact, it could be
implemented by only a simple 51% majority of miners, with-or-without
gaining the wider community consensus."
