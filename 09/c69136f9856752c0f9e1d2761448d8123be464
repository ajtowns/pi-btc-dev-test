Mixed bag of worms there, even ignoring what people have already
implemented? if you make it use satoshis people who are working with
things at COIN scale are inevitably going to end up multiplying
numbers stored as radix-2 floating point to get satoshis and then are
going to be confused when it comes out "wrong".

Using decimal numbers at least lets them treat the values as strings
and avoid arithmetic that will end up confusing them.
