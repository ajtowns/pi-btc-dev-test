Subject: [Bitcoin-development] standardize on bitcoin signed ecies ?
Message-ID: <CAKzHBKndU4nHHK=h4=G+hG_t_c77h0DHpeEUK+Kk9q2CsRHEcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone see a value in a standardized PGP-style message,
which would allow someone performing a bitcoin transaction to
send signed encrypted messages using only public and private
bitcoin keys ?

I'd like to propose a signed encrypted message protocol, in case
someone see's value in encoding such a thing into a BIP.
