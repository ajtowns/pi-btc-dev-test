This seems to be a really good idea... May I add in here something
that's been dismissed before but I will mention it again anyway...

http://is.gd/DiFuRr "dynamic block size adjustment"
My sense has been that something like this could be coupled with
Garzik's BIP 100.  For some reason I keep getting attacked for saying
this.
