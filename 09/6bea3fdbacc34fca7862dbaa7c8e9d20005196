That doesn't seem very generic.  It's tied far too much to the current storage 
format of bitcoind.

Wouldn't it be better to add support for more bitcoin-protocol-oriented HTTP 
requests?  Then any client can supply the same interface, rather than being 
forced to create blkNNNN.dat on the fly?

 http://bitcoind.example.com/block/BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
 http://bitcoind.example.com/tx/TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
 http://bitcoind.example.com/block/oftx/TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
 http://bitcoind.example.com/peers
 http://bitcoind.example.com/peer/nnn

Essentially: block explorer's raw mode but in every bitcoind.  The hardest 
operation for light clients is finding out the block that contains a 
particular transaction -- something that bitcoind already knows.

I'd like to see support for HTTP POST/PUT of signed transactions and block 
announcements too.
