If I were designing the serialization format today, I would drop the
fingerprint and expand child number to full BIP32 path. Good thing is
that we already have depth, so we know how long the BIP32 path would be.

So I suggest the following:

4 byte: version bytes
1 byte: depth
depth * 4 bytes: bip32 path
32 bytes
33 bytes
