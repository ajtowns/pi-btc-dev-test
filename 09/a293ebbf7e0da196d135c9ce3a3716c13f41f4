When I posted this: http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/32263765/
Peter Todd clarified that the concept was referred to as "scorched earth"
http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/32264039/

Like I said I don't like the name and would prefer "stag hunting"
which is more formal and precise.
Some people seem to use the same term for "the potential undesirable
consequences of widely deployed replace-by-fee policies".
I'm not sure that concept deserves its own term.

And maybe by maintaining first seen policies we're harming the system
in the long term by encouraging people to widely deploy systems based
on extremely weak assumptions.
