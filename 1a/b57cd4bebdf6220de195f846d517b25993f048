I like your analogy for how it frames blockchain compatibility in
terms of the backward compatibility that hopefully most
computer-literate people already understand, but there's a key
ingredient missing.

It's as if, if everyone in the world did somehow upgrade to Windows
95, it would become forever impossible to take a program written *on*
Windows 95 but *for* Windows 3.11, and successfully run it on a
Windows 3.11 computer. It would be as if cross-compilers from Windows
95 to Windows 3.11 didn't, and couldn't, exist. Any coins that have
post-hardfork coinbase outputs anywhere in their tree of inputs (a
Windows 3.11 program, that's written on a computer that has ever run a
Windows 95 program) can never be spent on the no-change side of the
fork.
