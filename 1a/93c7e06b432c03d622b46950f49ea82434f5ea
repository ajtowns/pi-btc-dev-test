Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposed CSV configuration file format for
	bip-genvbvoting
Message-ID: <oSJNwoymxRpAmalBAK3TJ02P5l3GrrAIaJjefWSkjLZwCJIFaS7QeeWWB9448L4h1_2xuDg3haLf8cC6iXLrppt0O0B8EZWR0ZEzUjJNs8k=@protonmail.com>

Hi,

The link below includes documentation about a proposed CSV-based file format for fork deployment data (tentative config filename: forks.csv). This is planned to be used by my reference implementation of bip-genvbvoting (which is still in development - TBA later).
Other BIP9 improvement proposals are of course encouraged to use this format, and I'm happy to discuss extensions of it for things like supporting flag days or direct-to-activation transitions.

Regards,
Sancho
