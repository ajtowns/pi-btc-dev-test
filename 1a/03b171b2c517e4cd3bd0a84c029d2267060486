Yes. The feature will be very good.

Please do enable any transactions that seem to be a possible solution.
Even if this client doesn't ever implement any of them, alternative
clients can try them.

I agree that something should be done with what we have now. It *will*
take months to properly figure out how to add chain-forking features for
this. If we want to consider all of the unrelated feature proposals, it
might take years of discussion...

However, as I said in the forum thread, I think it would be better for
people using this protection to receive at a normal address and then
create new transactions at their end. Then no one has to handle huge
addresses, and the sender will never have to pay abnormal fees or deal
with incompatibilities. There will be a short period of time when the
recipient's money is unprotected, but I think this is worth it. A better
scheme can be made later after chain-forking features are figured out.
