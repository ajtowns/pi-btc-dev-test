Sorry for picking your email.

I understand people want something different for the agreement, I know I do 
too.
We have a specific agreement on the table, signed by a huge subsection of the 
industry.

Maybe the time for changing things is not to be *after* the signatures are 
set. I know I?d change some detials. But do we really want to go through 
another conference where all the important people are present to agree on a 
compromise? Or can we use the one we have?

The compromise is pretty simple;

*  Activate Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4
*  Activate a 2 MB hard fork within six months
