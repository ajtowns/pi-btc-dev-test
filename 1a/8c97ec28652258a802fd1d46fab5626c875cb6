Greatly appreciate seeing this discussion occur.  This is something that
potentially could be supported through a bounty - possibly a process BIP?

> Yes, recurring payments and subscriptions is a frequently-requested
> feature.  It needs a new BIP.  Here is an outline:
>
> The situation is somewhat analogous to HTML5 local storage.  The remote
> (merchant) wants to initiate a persistent behavior.  This is bitcoin, so
> we
> have a "push" model for payment, and the user has complete control.  The
> merchant can, at most, send a "subscription request."  The user is
> responsible for making on-time payments after that point.
>
> Centralized services like coinbase.com or blockchain.info will have an
> easy
> time of it.  An automated program on their backend, sending payments as
> needed, is easy and direct.
>
> More inventive services might employ multisig transactions, generating and
> signing one signature of a TX, then sending that TX to the human for
> further signing and publishing.  A few competing vendors could offer bots
> that provide this signing service.
>
> Decentralized, standalone wallet clients will be somewhat troublesome.  We
> can store a local subscription request, and send recurring payments...  if
> the wallet app is running.  If not, the user will be missing payments,
> that
> perhaps they intended to make (rent!).
>
> Each of these solutions can be cancelled at any time by the user.  As
> such,
> a courtesy "subscription cancelled" message sent to the merchant is
> recommended.  User controls the usage of their money at all times, the way
> things should be.
>
> And finally, you do not want to make it /too easy/ to send money over and
> over again.  From a human-interface perspective, a textual reminder to
> send
> money might be preferred over actual recurring payment automation:
> reminder
> email + manual spend inserts a bit of additional human thought and review
> into the process, with all that entails.
