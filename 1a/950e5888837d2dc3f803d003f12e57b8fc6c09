Why not? The blocksize increase eliminates the pressure to seek durable
solutions. But it will turn out differently. Other than we all think.

I really can not imagine that a 20-year plan will be successful. At one
point we like to clear away the auto-increase. I think that is the only
thing for sure at the moment.

I hope that the current protocol and blockchain will be continued.
Perhaps with fewer people. That would settles the matter for the time
being. ;)
