> You are not a developer of any alternative clients

I am and I'm going to have to agree with Greg. Information about clients
is bound to be transient and controversial.

My relatively naive suggestion would be to move it to the Wiki. If it
can handle the controversies involved with the Trade page, it should
easily be able to handle the controversies involved with a Clients page
like this one. A link to that page could be added under Bitcoin Wiki on
Bitcoin.org.

On the subject of randomization, I think that's a bad idea. Randomness
does not equal fairness and more importantly it does not serve the
users, which should be the overriding concern. As a user I don't want to
be recommended a random client but the most sensible choice. As
alternative client implementors we should not be overly concerned about
Bitcoin.org recommending the wrong client, truly good clients will
benefit from word-of-mouth and eventually rise to the top. If you want a
"fair" ordering, then I'd order by number of downloads for downloadable
clients and Alexa rank for any hosted / online services if it were
decided that such should be listed at all.

Your suggestion to remove the clients page is your bias towards thinking that there should be only one Bitcoin client that everyone uses (the one which you contribute towards).
