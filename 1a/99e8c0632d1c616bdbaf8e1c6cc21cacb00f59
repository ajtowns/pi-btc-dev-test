There are several clever ways to exploit even chosen prefix collisions
using the scripting language. One could search for collisions where one
message is some data and the other is a jump over a critical check.

KEEP IT SIMPLE.

Ask the Iranian nuclear program. Or those brainwallet users.

burning the funds)
