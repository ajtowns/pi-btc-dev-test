A Java implementation of what is called BIPSS in lack of an official number
can be found here:
https://github.com/mycelium-com/wallet/blob/master/public/bitlib/src/main/java/com/mrd/bitlib/crypto/BipSs.java
(passing all test vectors)

Which is based on a GF2^8 implementation here:
https://github.com/mycelium-com/wallet/blob/master/public/bitlib/src/main/java/com/mrd/bitlib/crypto/Gf256.java

I think having 3 encoding formats (long/short/compact) is over engineered,
and basically only makes implementing the standard a pain in the rear. From
a user experience point of view only the long format makes sense, and it is
only a few bytes longer than the short version.
