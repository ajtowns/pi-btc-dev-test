Yup, that's part of the idea behind partial UTXO set mode. You could have a model where your node starts with no data at all, and hence SPV security. You tell your node what the oldest key birthday is that your interested in and it downloads the full block chain starting at that date, giving you your txs w/ SPV security and full node privacy.

What partial UTXO would add on top of that is then your node would gradually scan backwards until block zero, at which point it has a complete UTXO set and is a full node.
