Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Providing Payment Request within URI
Message-ID: <771EF431-6644-4BE4-B39C-CA73CFC18DB4@gmail.com>

Hi,

I wonder if there is a standard way to put Payment Request data into bitcoin: URI or directly into QR code. The goal is to allow device to generate a multi-output payment request on its own, without relying on the server and x509 certificates. When scanned via QR code from, say, POS, it's pretty secure, so no additional authentication needed.

I'd like something like this: 

bitcoin:?r=data://<base64url-encoded-payment-request>

If there's no standard for that, would it be a good idea to extend BIP72 this way?
