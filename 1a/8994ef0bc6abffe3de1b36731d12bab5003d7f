Perhaps if there were a message that would nag your stdout or log output
letting you know there's a new version available, or N more versions
available and that you might be missing out on X security patches, Y
protocol improvements, depending on how far back you are, you'd be tempted
to upgrade, works for me in Ubuntu every time I log to my servers and I see
how far behind I am in terms of available updates.

Other thing done in open source projects to encourage updates, is to
automatically distribute (download) the patches and let the node operator
know an update has been downloaded for them, and let them know they're just
one step away from applying such update.
We do this for our bittorrent client. We don't ever want to do automatic
upgrades of our network, however, we want to make it painless to update.

For Bitcoin this could be done for the official binary distribution, would
not be an option for those that build from source.
