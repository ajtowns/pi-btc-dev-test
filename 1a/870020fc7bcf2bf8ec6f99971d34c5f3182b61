Justus,

We don?t even have a concept of identity in the Bitcoin protocol, let alone non-repudiation. What good is non-repudiation if there?s no way to even associate a signature with a legal entity?

Sure, we could use the ECDSA signatures in transactions as part of a non-repudiation scheme - but the recipient would have to also have a means to establish the identity of the sender and associate it with the the transaction.


Furthermore, in light of the fact that there *are* fully legitimate use cases for sending conflicting transactions?and the fact that determination of intent isn?t always entirely clear?we should refrain from attaching any further significance transaction signatures other than that ?the sender was willing to have it included in the blockchain if a miner were to have seen it and accepted it?but perhaps the sender would have changed their mind before it actually did get accepted.?
