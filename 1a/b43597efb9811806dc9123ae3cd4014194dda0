I see. That is undeniably more secure and "bitcoin-y" than my suggestion.

It's also really a lot more work, especially in that it requires extra
linkages between codebases that in my mind are largely separate.

I'm just one voice, but I persist in believing that the 'lighter' solution,
especially for something that may not be a particularly big problem in the
bitcoin world is good -- it carries much less technical implementation debt
going forward, and has a lower risk of sort of seizing up development with
additional necessary code to worry about for those implementing to-spec
clients.

If that lighter solution turns out to be gameable, or has problems that
require the full force of the bitcoin network and concepts, that would be
the time to implement the improved version. That's just my approach,
however. I worry that building in any additional requirements to the
protocol or codebase adds significant cost to the network as a whole over
the next 10 years.
