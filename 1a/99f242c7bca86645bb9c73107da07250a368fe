I disagree entirely. Your example of "straw polls" for bug fixes and
features is precisely what the current method of rough consensus and
running code, an IETF expression, handles just fine.

What the method does not handle effectively are issues that are
fundementally political rather than technical in nature. Blocksize is
precisely the latter because while the tradeoffs are technical in
nature the fundemental issue at hand is what do we want Bitcoin to be?
Who are we going to allow to participate?
