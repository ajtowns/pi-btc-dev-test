Probably on Android it's being verified in Java instead of C++. Some
Android APIs are backed by OpenSSL but I don't know off hand if the way
we're verifying cert chains on Android is. It's eminently fixable, at any
rate.

X.509 cert chains are pretty bloated, but even so, shouldn't take several
seconds to transfer even over Bluetooth.

BLE isn't really connection oriented, as far as I know.
