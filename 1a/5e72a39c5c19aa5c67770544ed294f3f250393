The way Bitcoin Wallet does it, the bitcoin URI includes a MAC address
where you can download the request from. BIP70 does not depend on internet
access or HTTP, plus, you don't have to sign them.

The name field might work but requires the merchant to set it, e.g. by
asking the payer what their name is, then typing it in, then the payer has
to wait for it to show up. By this point it's probably faster to have
scanned a QR code.
