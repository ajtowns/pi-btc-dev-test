I understand this concern and it's a valid one, including other dimensions
such as better decentralization. Some might argue that the mining pools in
China currently have such power and that's a bad thing:-

I happen to think  that it's unhealthy for the network but the irony is
that they are huge bitcoin fanbase that perhaps should be involved in this,
and other,  decisions. The question is how.

Thus far our friends from f2pool have chimed in with some data from their
perspective. It would be interesting to hear from the others and I'm
finding ways to do exactly that.

So let's find a way to involve, and not alienate them or others. Let's find
a way to get more data and test assumptions and boundaries.


It essentially lets them vote to change the rules of the system.

I fully agree and it doesn't have to be the only voice ...  think 'choir'
...  after all this is an ecosystem with each party playing their
respective roles. But sustainable ecosystems have 'keystone' species, and I
believe these to be the 'honest' miners that help secure the network.

Instead, we vote with the software we run, and all upgrade.

or not as the case may be.   I think we're trying to find a level of rough
consensus where members of the community feel comfortable enough to do this
upgrade in their respective codebase.

Bitcoin was 'unlikely' ...  yet it happened.

Nevertheless you raise the possibility of a different possible path forward
and that's positive. So thank you for doing that!

Bitcoin's humming in China, behind an GFW ... who could have guessed?

'Connect and Liberate' :)
