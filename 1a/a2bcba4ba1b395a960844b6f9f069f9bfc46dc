Too early for that.

The quantized scheme limits the amount of difficulty skew miners can
create by lying about timestamps to about a half a percent. A rolling
window with the same time constant would allow much more skew.

Increasing precision I would agree with but, sadly, causing people to
need more than 64 bit would create a lot of bugs.

infinite numerator + denominator is absolutely completely and totally
batshit insane. For one, it has weird consequences that the same value
can have redundant encodings.

Most importantly, it suffers factor inflation: If you spend inputs
1/977 1/983 1/991 1/997 the smallest denominator you can use for the
output 948892238557.

Not to mention that the idiots writing financial software can only
barely manage to not use radix-2 floating point on everything. Asking
them to use arbitrary rational numbers with mixed radix will never
fly.

Please lets not make bitcoin _less_ trustworthy.

The 100 block maturity on generated coins is good. The generation from
an orphaning is lost forever like the losing side of a double spend,
but far far worse... because orphaning happens all the time on its own
without any malice.

I agree it's obnoxious that you can't pad your generation payouts
without creating more transactions, but I don't see a solution for
that. Repeat the addresses... make up for it by increasing your payout
threshold.
