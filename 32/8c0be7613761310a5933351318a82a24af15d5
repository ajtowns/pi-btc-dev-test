I'm really glad to see this proposal.  We already treat non-DER
signatures as non-standard in btcd and agree that extending them be
illegal as a part of a soft fork is a smart and sane thing to do.

It's also good to see the explicit use of signature parsing since it
matches what we already do as well because we noticed noticed OpenSSL's
notion of big numbers (unsigned) didn't agree with Go's (signed).  By
having the explicit signature scheme and checking clearly called out in
a BIP, it greatly lowers the chances of there being any disagreement
about what is valid or invalid due to an underlying dependency.
