I think you're misunderstanding me: I'm assuming one of the n parties
signing transactions in my multi-factor authentication scheme is
uncompromised - much easier to do when it's a low-bandwidth box sitting
in a secure location.

Not re-using keys is nice too of course, and while not perfect - your
above scenario - certainely helps limit losses.
