We could care less about you selling your bitcoins or moving to
something else.

What we care more is keeping bitcoin a successful project which offers
clear benefits to the world. I agree a fee market is good and needed,
and transactions shouldn't be free ever, but users should also be able
to transact fast and relatively cheap, as opposite to the competition,
or at least with the same costs, so people won't move to something else.

The more people use bitcoin, the more demand we have on the market for
BTC, the higher BTC/FIAT rate will be, more people will become
interested in mining and so on. Bitcoin is not a rich-only-private-club,
it's an open, global, decentralized payment network. The less people use
it... I guess you figured it out.

So we could care less that you will go away in case the fee market won't
become absurd or too expensive to use for most users. Having some
offchain solution for small transactions would be a good idea, but this
doesn't mean we should make small transactions impossible due to absurd
fees.
