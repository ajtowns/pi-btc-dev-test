Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Do not use github issues on BIPs repository
Message-ID: <CA+s+GJA9ki6RUZ8S3wRW5Pev-COSotkVkL=b_6DHZnCnW4j45Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I see that people have been filing issues on the Bitcoin Improvement
Requests repository, https://github.com/bitcoin/bips.

This is not how it is supposed to work -- BIP authors are not required
to monitor the github issues, and it is not a good place to discuss in
the first place. If you have a remark about a BIP or want to discuss
it please use this mailing list (preferably) or contact the authors
some other way.

After discussion you can submit a pull request. Or if the change is
trivial, such as a typo, you can submit a pull immediately.

For this reason I intend to disable issues (not pull requests, of
course) on the repository.

Wladimir
