Hi Emin

This is going into the right direction. Well done!
The certificates (X.509/p12) are far more enduser-friendly than just a
normal PoE hash.

Your site needs some UX love and i just tried to OR_RETURN a
Email-Address-Verification. But after creating a 0.0001 tx and waiting
for two confirmations it still said that the payment has not yet been
received. There is probably something broken regarding the bitcoin
payment verification.

The weather and real estate notarization definitively needs a ?US
only? badge somewhere.

Two ideas:
- - Maybe adding a way of decentralize your notary service log via a
opensource p2p daemon (obviously sensitive data should be somehow
encrypted)?
- - Adding a opensource UI app to examine certs (maybe offline capable
with p2p daemon chain as mentioned above). This could prove
independence from your website/service.
