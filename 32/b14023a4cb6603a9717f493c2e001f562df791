Sorry, Bitcoin is not about the same thing to everyone. For me, Bitcoin is 
about one thing: providing a monetary system for the Tonal number system. 
Otherwise, it would be merely an interesting project I have no real concern 
with. To assume everyone has the same interests is a sure-fire way to prevent 
widescale adoption. If you want Bitcoin to succeed, don't try to impose a 
single purpose/"about" on everyone using it (which a "blackout" would do).

Bitcoin is an innovative new currency. How is a bill on internet censorship 
(which is badly needed, even if not in the form of SOPA/PIPA) directly 
relevant? I don't think it is.
