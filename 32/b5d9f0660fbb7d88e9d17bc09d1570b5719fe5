It certainly is not subjective, in that people are far more used to dealing
with whole numbers than decimals.  Try reading the first one, then reading
the second one.  Tell those numbers to someone else, have them write it
down, and see how many people screw up the first vs. the second.  This has
nothing to do with whether it "looks expensive".  There are reasons for
wanting the numbers to be higher as well, as evidenced by the number of
Dogecoin enthusiasts who like "having more", even if it doesn't matter.
 That part gets more subjective, but still favors micros in most cases.
 Sure, 3000 may sound like a lot, but if you have a lot more, it's all a
different scale.

If the argument is for keeping things based on what is already done, why
even switch to millis?  After all, everyone is used to full Bitcoins, why
even change to millis?  Whatever your arguments are there, for switching
base bitcoins to millis, try to see why they fail at micros (other than the
subjective argument that I'm used to decimal units of currency being worth
a cup of coffee, even though numerous people all over the world don't have
that conditioning).
