Make a transaction with two outputs.  Output A is your payee.  Output B is a fee to whoever transmits the transaction to the network.  Sign and print the transaction, along with private key controlling address of output B.  Put it in the mail with instructions to 1 or more greedy people who don't know you.   

Does namecoin allow mixing outputs for name registration with pay to hash outputs ?  If so, you could use namecoin for anonymous publishing via post.  Or just make output A in bitcoin scripted with op_return if its a 40byte tweet.
