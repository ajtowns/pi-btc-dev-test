I get concerned when I hear statement like "the raison d'etre of bitcoin
is trustlessness" because it implies that Bitcoin promises infinite
security, which has never been the case.

I don't think we can meaningfully discuss Bitcoin security issues if
every proposal is compared to a straw standard of perfection which is
achievable. When everybody expects infinite security then the perfect
turns into the enemy of the good (and the achievable).
