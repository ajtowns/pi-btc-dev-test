Just to make sure there are no misunderstandings, as far as I know there is
no reason to assume the reported problem (comment on #2726) is:
1) a fork (it's an indeterministic and avoidable database corruption, it seems)
2) related to leveldb
3) reproducible by more than one person
4) debian's fault.

That said, I think reaching out to packagers to educate them about the risks
is a good idea - but let's not blame people before we understand our own
problems.
