Hello,

I wanted to just add a very brief note to this discussion, that presently
for multisignature creation and management (new transaction etc) I've been
using this: https://coinb.in/multisig/

There were some initial bumps in the road but they were worked out,

see full thread more or less beginning from here:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=390046.msg4687868#msg4687868

Curious as to what wallets actually support multisig / P2SH at this point?
Unsure.  Am assuming more than previously.
