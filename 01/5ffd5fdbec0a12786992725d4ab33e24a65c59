That should probably be clarified in the BIP, I agree. Perhaps it ought to be 
assigned the same as BIP numbers themselves, by the BIP editor? (Although as a 
limited resource, maybe that's not the best solution.)

I don't think that's possible. First of all, a hardfork can always occur, 
since this is something done by the economy and not (even possibly opposed to) 
miners. Furthermore, consider the change affecting how further rule changes 
are made, such as a PoW algorithm change.
