Since a soft-fork is a restriction of the consensus rules, I think the
only way to have an un-soft-forkable cryptocurrency is creating a
cryptocurrency where no transaction is valid.

Imagine I build a very minimal cryptocurrency where in the transaction
output you only indicate the public key to send your coins to and the
amount. One can still soft-fork it by deciding that, from now on, only
even amounts are valid or only public keys that are a multiple of 10 are
valid.
