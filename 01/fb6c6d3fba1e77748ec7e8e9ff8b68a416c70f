As specified in BIP001, there's an optional field to link to the
discussion on the mailing list, which in this case links to this
thread (that's why I'm replying here):

You are probably right, but that is too vague for me to take any action.
Can you propose something more concrete as a PR to my branch?

Can you explain why?
I think they're helpful as examples for the explanations (even though
the concrete texts can probably improved/summarized).

I'm not sure I understand this.
What do you mean by "code forks"?
If you mean "software fork" (like libcoin or bitcoin xt
[pre-controversial-bip101]) those are completely fine and out of scope
for this BIP, since they don't require coordination by the different
users/implementations to upgrade/re-implement the consensus changes.

I don't think the spell checking had been followed at all for this or
any other BIP, but yes, Greg assigned the number 99 (he did so
privately instead of here on this thread, which I find very annoying
because you are the second person who complains about this).

That is a good question. The proposal currently says "informational |
process": https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/181/files#diff-e331b8631759a4ed6a4cfb4d10f473caR6
But I wasn't really convinced about this so I'm happy to change it to
whatever it's more appropriate.
The contained code is an example of an uncontroversial hardfork to
create a precedent. I'm not sure I understand your proposal for a
"patch into core as a module that hard forks can use in the future".
Can you elaborate what would go in that patch?
