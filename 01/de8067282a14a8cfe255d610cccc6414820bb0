I don't see how. It seems like the logical outcome from this is "whoever pays 
the most gets the next sidechain block"... That's not particularly useful for 
merge mining.

There are different kinds of sidechains...

Federated peg: this already works on Bitcoin.
SPV/SNARK peg: this isn't enabled by your BIP.
Drivechains: this isn't enabled by your BIP.

How do you say this enables any kind of sidechain?

This is unacceptable, for reasons Greg already pointed out.

Note that this is not acceptable for BIPs anymore.
