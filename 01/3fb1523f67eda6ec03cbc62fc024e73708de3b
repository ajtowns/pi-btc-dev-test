I did this for a Bitcoin-only Wi-Fi network I operated at a remote festival. We had well over a hundred lightweight wallets, all trying to connect to the Bitcoin P2P network over a very bandwidth-constrained Internet link, so I poisoned the DNS and rejected all outbound connection attempts on port 8333, to force all the wallets to connect to a single local full node, which had connectivity to a single remote node over the Internet. Thus, all the lightweight wallets at the festival had Bitcoin network connectivity, but we only needed to backhaul the Bitcoin network's transaction traffic once.

Interesting!

What festival was this?
