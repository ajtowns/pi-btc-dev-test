This is not correct.

As only about 1/3 of nodes support BIP65 now, would you consider CLTV tx 
are less secure than others? I don't think so. Since one invalid CLTV tx 
will make the whole block invalid. Having more nodes to fully validate 
non-CLTV txs won't make them any safer. The same logic also applies to 
SW softfork.

You may argue that a softfork would make the network as a whole less 
secure, as old nodes have to trust new nodes. However, the security of 
all content in the same block must be the same, by definition.

Anyway, I support SW softfork at the beginning, and eventually (~2 
years) moving to a hardfork with higher block size limit and better 
commitment structure.
