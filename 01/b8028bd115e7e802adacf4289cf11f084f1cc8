 A P2P Trustless Cryptocoin Exchange
Message-ID: <5E87867AB6214424BF99A460C56A1365@xk.io>

Hi All, 

If any of you are interested, I've put forward a proposal for a P2P Trustless Cryptocoin Exchange. I don't have anyone around to bounce ideas off; my apologies if there's any gaping logical holes.

You can find details here:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=198032.0

I'd really appreciate any insight any of you have on the matter. (And look forward to hopefully meeting a few of you at the conference).

Cheers,
Max
