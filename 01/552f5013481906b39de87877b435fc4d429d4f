Refunds in this circumstance would be problematic because someone is going
to lose because they have to pay the fee. If the sender's money is refunded
minus the fee, they will be unhappy. And the merchant will be unhappy about
having had an unacceptable transaction they have to send back, and eat a
fee for the privilege.

This kind of situation needs to be avoided at all costs.
