The rationale doesn't seem to apply to rule #4, what's so special about
that one?

Although I agree not having to support all of DER is nice, in practice I
think all implementations do and libraries to parse DER are widespread.
Given that the last time we modified tx rules without bumping version
numbers we managed to break the only functioning iPhone client, I've become
a big fan of backwards compatibility: seems the default choice should be to
preserve compatibility over technical niceness until the old versions have
been fully phased out.
