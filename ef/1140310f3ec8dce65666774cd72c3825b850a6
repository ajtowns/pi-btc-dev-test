I'll point out that I personally raised an issue with segpregated
witnesses quite recently - my concern that it could make validationless
mining easier and more profitable(1). Neither Pieter Wuille nor Gregory
Maxwell believed my concern to be important at first in private
communication. However, it was still discussed on IRC, with Pieter,
Greg, and others contributing valuable input on the problem and my
proposed fix. Right now I think the next step for me is to write the
code to implement my fix and submit a pull-req against the segwit
branch.

I certainly wouldn't describe that experience as "Here's the spec, take
it or leave it; We don't what what you think."
