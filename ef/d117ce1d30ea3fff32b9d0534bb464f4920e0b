You make a logical fallacy;

I would agree that nodes are there for people to stop trusting someone that 
they have no trust-relationship with.

But your conclusion that low node count is an indication that its hard to run 
one discards your own point.  You forget the point that running a node is only 
needed if you don't know anyone you can trust to run it for you.  I'm pretty 
darn sure that this will have a bigger effect on nodecount than how hard it 
is.
Or, in other words, without a need to run a node you can't judge the 
difficulty of why there aren't more running.

This is a very political answer; it doesn't actually say anything since 
'unnecessary' is a personal judgment. Everyone will agree with you, but that 
doesn't mean anything.
