Surely the TCP connection will be reset once the route reconfiguration is
completed, either by the MITM server or by the client TCP stack when it
discovers the server doesn't know about the connection anymore?

TLS without cert validation defeats the point, you can still be connected
to a MITM at any point by anyone who can simply interrupt or corrupt the
stream, forcing a reconnect.
