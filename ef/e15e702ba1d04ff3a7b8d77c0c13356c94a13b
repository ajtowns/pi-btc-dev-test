To clarify, I believe LYING about the client is a violation. Specifically, 
Gavin's commit intentionally reports "bitcoin-qt" for bitcoind. A common name 
for the codebase is compliant, and I don't see anything that says a version 
*must* be reported at all, let alone for a specific component, so it *could* 
comply by leaving that part off. But if there is a common part, it certainly 
isn't Bitcoin-Qt.

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/715 contains a fix that should fulfil 
everyone's desires (Gavin wants security by obscurity by making bitcoind and 
Bitcoin-Qt indistinguishable; this is the default with pull #715).
