I'm not sure it makes much of a difference. First of all, in point of
fact, the miners themselves own the coins from the coinbase. But more
importantly, even if miners did not explicitly own the coins, they might
profit by being bribed -- these bribes would come from people who did
own the coins.

The principle is that value "v' has been taken from A and given to B.
This is effectively coercive activity, and therefore itself has value
proportional to 'v'.

Yes. The more value _on_ the sidechain, the more abhorrent the malfeasance.

What do you think of my argument, that we already labor under such an
assumption? An attacker could pay fees today equal to greater than
sum(blockreward_(last N block)). According to you this would force a
reorg, even on mainchain (pre-sidechain) Bitcoin. Yet this has never
happened.

It seems that this argument fully reduces to the "what will happen when
the block subsidy falls to zero" question.

See above (?) for why I still feel they are comparable, if not identical.

Yes. Sidechains have newer, more interesting features, and
simultaneously more risk.

Again, I think that we _already_ need to eliminate any assumption of
"charitable miners".

Yes, we may see interesting behavior where people buy up these
liabilities using the LN. In my original post, I mention that miners
themselves may purchase these liabilities (at competitive rates, even if
these arent the idealized 1:1). At this point, miners would be paying
themselves and there would be no agency problem.

If you haven't seen http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/drivechain/ , that is
probably the most human-readable description.
