Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin Core 0.10.0 final was tagged
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.10.1502131037240.29068@nzrgulfg.ivfhpber.pbz>

Hello,

I've just tagged 0.10.0rc4 as final (with a small packaging change to 
avoid tar nastiness). The tag is 'v0.10.0'.

Start your gitian builders!

For a guide on how to do gitian builds see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md

Please wait with a release announcement until there are >3
builders and the binaries have been uploaded.

Cheers,
Wladimir
