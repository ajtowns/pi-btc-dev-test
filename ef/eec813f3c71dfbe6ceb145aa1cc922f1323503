FWIW Gavin has spent quite a bit of time and effort ensuring that
Bitcoin is resistent to DoS attacks, as well as spearheading a move
towards better testing. The latter in particular is helpful against
chain-forking bugs, so better testing is very much a security issue. He
also spearheaded P2SH, and the current efforts to get a payment protocol
implemented. I'm less convinced about his stance against attackers that
pose a threat to the system as a whole, but it's not fair to accuse him
of not taking security seriously.

You should clarify if you want this patch to compute fees recursively or
not, IE, should the patch include fees paid by child transactions in how
it computes the total fee the transaction pays. Doing this is
non-trivial, although Luke-Jr has written a patch to do this without
replacement: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1647

Also, clarify if you want unit-tests and similar things included in the
implementation.
