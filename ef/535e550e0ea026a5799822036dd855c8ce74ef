So you mean that,

   1. Govt agencies already know about everything and anything this subject
   is about, but passively.
   2. Due to passive nature, the actions are post incident and not pre. So
   there is a risk of many ticking time-bombs which some JB (Jack Bauer or
   James Bond or Jai Singh Rathore) would diffuse. Sorry for being dramatic,
   the purpose is to make the point, and nothing else.
   3. The subjected proposal doesn't breach the decentralisation, but just
   not like swiss democracy.

I am not a legal expert, but know this much that there are 2 kinds of
crimes, one against liberty and other against life. Most of online privacy
advocacy is for liberty. But money is attached to life and not liberty. So
this has to change. It means life for many and many depend on it.

And the appeal is, Let us get active.

PS: I do not own much of bitcoins to be an advocate, but many others do and
any mayhem would affect me somehow, even if in farthest of world.

Best,

Prabhat Kumar Singh
