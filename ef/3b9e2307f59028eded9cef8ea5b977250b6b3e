- We now are witnessing this... COOP vs LukeJr COOP, vs BIP148 vs BIP149 vs
BIP91 ... how many are there?:

https://xkcd.com/927

- If some miners and exchanges collude to enact a rapid 2MB+Segwit hard
fork coin... and calling it "bitcoin" on major exchanges this could swiftly
fragment the network.

- If this fork fails to contain an ASICBOOST defense, then this is
essentially an example of core failing to appropriately respond to the CVE
security vulnerability in time.

- A swift BIP148 release in core seems necessary to defend against this.
I am no longer in favor of adding a BIP148 option with default "false"..
I think it should be merged in...enabled, and released ASAP to defend
against these attacks.
