I don't see a need for a new RPC interface, just a new signature format.

Ideally, it should support not only just "proof I receive at this address", 
but also "proof of funds" (as a separate feature) since this is a popular 
misuse of the current message signing (which doesn't actually prove funds at 
all). To do this, it needs to be capable of signing for multiple inputs.

Preferably, it should also avoid disclosing the public key for existing or 
future UTXOs. But I don't think it's possible to avoid this without something 
MAST-like first. Perhaps it can be a MAST upgrade later on, but the new 
signature scheme should probably be designed with it in mind.
