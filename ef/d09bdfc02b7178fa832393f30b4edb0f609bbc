I should add that in the interest of peace and goodwill, I extend an offer to both Mike and Gavin to make their grievances heard?but only on the condition that we make a good effort to avoid misrepresentation and misreading of the other side?s intentions.

He hurts the PR battle and plays into Mike?s hand by doing that. The actual underlying issue actually has little to do with block size - it has to do with Mike and Gavin feeling that the core devs are being obstructionist.

It?s too easy to spin resistance to bigger blocks (even though the resistance is actually much more towards untested hardforking mechanisms and serious security concerns) as ?obstructionism? and it?s too easy to spin bigger blocks as ?scalability? because most of the people can?t tell the fucking difference.

> If you guys want to win the PR battle, the key is to make it clear that you are not obstructionist and are giving everyone equal treatment?Bitcoin was designed such that changing the rules is *hard* and this is a feature. Bitcoin simply does not have a reliable and tested hard forking mechanism?and a hard fork for such a politically divisive issue will almost certainly lead to a lack of cooperation and refusal to work together out of spite. All of us would like to be able to process more transactions on the network. It?s not a matter of whether we think higher capacity is a bad thing - it?s more that some of us are concerned that Bitcoin is not sufficiently mature to be able to handle such a schism with so much hostility.

Nobody really understands it except for a handful of people - I?ve tried to explain it, I?ve even written articles about it - but most people just don?t get it. Most people don?t really get scalability either - they seem to think that scalability is just doing the same thing you?ve always done manyfold.
