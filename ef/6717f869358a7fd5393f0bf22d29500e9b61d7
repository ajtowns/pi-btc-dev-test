Turned this into a pull request:
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/505

I reviewed the code but have not tested.

Rough sketch of a test plan:

Run clean testnet-in-a-box bitcoind, with -keypool=1
Encrypt the wallet
Run bitcoind getnewaddress until it tell you keypool is exhausted
Generate a couple of blocks via internal miner -- verify: coinbase
transactions have unique txids even though they pay-to default key
Generate a couple of blocks via getwork RPC call -- verify: coinbase
transactions have unique txids
