Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP70: Canceling Payments
Message-ID: <5kemthp1y7py3inyyquy78cf.1391459458968@email.android.com>

Is BIP70 limited to http only?

What about face to face scenarios, or realtime like ticket sales or gambling, and socket and/or bluetooth type connections?

</div>Over http, the merchant doesn't have the ability to reach out to the
consumer's bitcoin wallet on their own. So sending "Cancel Payment
Request" to the user is impossible.

If the customer doesn't want to send, nothing ever needs to happen. So
sending a "Reject Payment Request" to the merchant is useless.

The unhappy path scenario with Payment Requests (customer paid, but
for whatever reason that payment is no longer valid) can be simply
solved in 1 of 2 ways:

If the merchant realizes the mistake, they can refund the money.
If the customer realizes the problem, they can contact the merchant,
provide the signed request, and ask the merchant to return the funds.

What isn't covered?
