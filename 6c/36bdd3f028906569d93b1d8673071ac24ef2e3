In the short-term, maybe. Keep in mind that the code for tx relay is
fairly different and the bandwidth for transaction relay on these
nodes is already lower than it is for blocks (by design). That said,
I'd like to look into doing tx-less block relays for transactions that
peers already have to limit block relay times even for large blocks,
in which case tx relay is very much required.
