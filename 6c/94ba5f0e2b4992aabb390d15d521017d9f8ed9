BIP 39 was designed to make brainwallets secure!  If a user generates a 
weakling 12-word mnemonic from 16 tiny octets of entropy drawn off the 
non-artistic /dev/urandom, then protects its seed with a creative 
passphrase haiku about the power of human stupidity, then the result 
will have a 128-bit security level.  PROVE ME WRONG.
