This isn't about developers.

This is about venture capitalists taking lots of money from unsuspecting
investors, and MtGox is in a psy-ops PR-war with multiple other exchanges
and lots of places that would like to take their market share and money.

Why do you want the 'official' PR-spin-war response approved by the official
bitcoin developer PR-firm, who's probably being paid by competitors to MtGox?

Name me one single person with commit access to the bitcoin github repository
who is *independent* of any venture capital or other 'investment' connections.

Fortunately for the rest of us, any dumb farmer can create a copycatcoin

Hell, if MtGox hosted their *own* fork of bitcoin I'd run that in a heartbeat.


And for full disclosure, I am available for consulting if anyone would like 
assistance setting up and hosting an independent source code repository that
includes good automated regression tests.
