The majority (~90%) is negative R or S values (which are just interpreted as
unsigned by OpenSSL, but if the top byte has its highest bit set, it must be
preceeded by a 0x00 accordinging to DER). A smaller number uses excessively
padded R or S value (with a 0x00 in front when it's not necessary). Finally
there are 4 signatures with an incorrect length marker in the beginning
(which likely means they contain some garbage at the end).
