I missed that, that does effectively address that concern.  It appears
that BIP148 implements the same rule as would be required to prevent a
later chainsplit as well, no?

This comment did bring to mind another concern about BIP148/91 though,
which I'll raise in the pull request discussion.  Feel free to respond
to it there.
