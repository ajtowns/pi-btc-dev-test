The point is not that they get it *wrong*, it's that the implement it 
*differently*.  Given a set of 100 TxOuts, there's a seemingly-infinite 
number of ways to construct a binary tree.  Put them in in a different 
order, and you get a different tree. *They're all correct and legal* in 
terms of satisfying expectations of insert, delete and query runtime -- 
but they will produce different root hashes.   And the differences in 
underlying structure are completely transparent to the calling code.

I'm extremely uncomfortable with the idea the you can have all the nodes 
in the tree, but have to replay X years of blockchain history just to 
get the same tree configuration as someone else.  However, a trie 
configuration is history-independent -- given an unspent-TxOut list, 
there's only one way to construct that tree.  That's an important 
property to me.

I can't tell if you're joking about Judy structures: I've never heard of 
them.  But I'll look into it anyway...
