Subject: [bitcoin-dev] A roadmap to a better header format and bigger

As for your stages idea, I generally like the idea (and mentioned it may
be a good idea in my proposal), but am worried about scheduling two
hard-forks at once....Lets do our first hard-fork first with the things
we think we will need anytime in the visible future that we have
reasonable designs for now, and talk about a second one after we've seen
what did/didnt blow up with the first one.

Anyway, this generally seems reasonable - it looks like most of this
matches up with what I said more specifically in my mail yesterday, with
the addition of timewarp fixes, which we should probably add, and Luke's
header changes, which I need to spend some more time thinking about.
