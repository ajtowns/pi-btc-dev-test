You mean you wrote a bunch of FUD about zeroconf transactions while 
working for companies like Coinbase and GreenAddress that were trying to 
sell 100% centralized solutions? Lets just be clear on this.

I and many other people tried your replace-by-fee tools and found out 
that they worked **maybe** 1-2% of the time. You claimed 95% success 
rates.
