It seems you're not very well informed about what namecoin does? it's
a multiple namespace key-value store. And, as Peter pointed out? a
non-parasitic system can have exactly the same POW hashpower. Namecoin
chose a model which made it so that namecoin could survive even if
Bitcoin failed, but you don't have to.

I strongly recommend you listen to Peter and Luke? externalizing the
costs of your services onto people who do not care about them is not
going to produce good results for anyone. It's possible to accomplish
what you want to accomplish without taking resources from the users of
the Bitcoin currency without their consent? and you have people here
who are willing to help you figure out how.
