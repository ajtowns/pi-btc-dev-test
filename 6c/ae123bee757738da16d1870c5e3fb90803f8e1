Hybrid SPV sounds like a good idea to me. Allows it to work out-of-the-box,
then slowly gets up-to-speed with the full network - working low priority,
or even not at all, if it detects a slow system or network link.
Another idea is always distributing the client with a checkpoint that is
only days old, then starting by pulling in more recent blocks, so it can
transact. Following that, it will pull in progressively older blocks as
time permits.
