NACK

Horrible precedent (hardcoding rule changes based on the assumption that large forks indicate a catastrophic failure), extremely poor process (already shipped, now the discussion), and not even a material performance optimization (the checks are avoidable once activated until a sufficiently deep reorg deactivates them).

Now that the chain has long since passed the blocks at which those consensus rules have triggered, we can (as a simplification and optimization) replace the trigger mechanism by caching the block heights at which those consensus rules became enforced.
