Sorry if I missed the rationale earlier, but why not just do a transaction,
with a FORKID specifically for this? Then a node can have a mempool
acceptance test that returns true even if the signature is not valid as per
Bitcoin consensus, but only due to the FORKID?

This way basically any wallet can support this provided generic FORKID
support.
