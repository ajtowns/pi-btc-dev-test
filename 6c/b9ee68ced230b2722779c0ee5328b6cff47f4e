Peter, I like the idea of being able to know what fees to expect from different miners (it is like a service description / SLA for their service), but I would prefer a more distributed discovery mechanism for the information on the fees (Spent 10 years on Grid Computing...).

Miners could e.g. include a pointer to a webpage (or even their min fee) in the coinbase (encoded properly, like the "/P2SH/" string for BIP0016). That way clients could look it up them selves or you could create sites accumulating this information from the chain it self.

So something like :
        const char* service_sla = "|https://my_ubercool_asic_mining_pool/sla.php|";
        COINBASE_FLAGS << std::vector<unsigned char>(service_sla, service_sla+strlen(service_sla));
 
The format of the sla.php page should then be specified too - but it could be a json-rpc call returning a json object like (as result):
{ 
    sla_version: "0.1",
    accept_no_fee_tx: false,
    min_fee: 50000,
    big_tx_fee: 10000, // extra fee pr kb
}
I guess miners could work out a more suitable set of fees...

Seems like this calls for a BIP ?
