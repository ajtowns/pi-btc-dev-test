Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Do we really need a mempool? (for relay nodes)

Some brief thoughts, adding here a suggestion for a dynamic approach
to the issue. (e.g. each additional tx relayed has some thing
associated with it, that is, a "doubling" for each additional tx
relayed that spends a given UTXO, doesn't sound like it would be the
most dynamic approach to the issue; considering that full nodes use
the (UTXOs) to establish if transactions are valid ? all inputs to a
transaction must be in the UTXO database for it to be valid, but
rather, would end up ratcheting upward the fee/kB for each additional
tx relayed, as proposed).

A more dynamic fee approach would be a better one, imho, but how is
this to occur?

Quoting from Gavin Andresen's http://gavinandresen.ninja/utxo-uhoh,
"The entire UTXO set doesn?t have to be in RAM; it can be stored on an
SSD or spinning hard disk. The access pattern to the UTXO is not
random; outputs that were spent recently are more likely to be
re-spent than outputs that have not been spent in a long time. Bitcoin
Core already has a multi-level UTXO cache, thanks to the hard work of
Pieter Wuille."

The relay nodes would, in this scenario that is proposed here in this
message, be confirming and discarding; the wallet nodes, if I
understand properly, in this scenario, as proposed, should be
retaining (keeping a record of the transactions they've relayed and
using a mempool).

There are some questions here:

- - How is the mempool to be limited?
- - What is the mechanism by which the UTXO set is stored (or proposed
to be stored)?
- - How would dynamic fee determinations be calculated?
- - Please describe more the general purpose messaging network?

Thank you
