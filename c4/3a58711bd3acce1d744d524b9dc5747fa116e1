Great, I?ll revise it.

Follow-up questions:

1. Is there any useful case which one would like to use NOINPUT with scriptCode and/or scriptPubKey committed? (Note that with taproot/MAST, scriptCode and scriptPubKey are not interchangeable. scriptPubKey commits to all branches, and scriptCode is just one script branch). If yes, we could make this configurable.

2. Which of the following approaches is better?
A) sign scriptPubKey in every cases except NOINPUT
B) sign the type (P2SH-segwit vs. Native-segwit) of scriptPubKey in every cases, including NOINPUT
C) all of the above
D) none of the above

Option B is very easy to implement as SignatureHash() could distinguish the type by the size of scriptSig in TxTo. Option A is more complicated as GenericTransactionSignatureChecker needs to know the scriptPubKey.

If the only reason for doing this is to allow hardware wallet to distinguish the segwit type, option B is probably enough. This is also compatible with eltoo.

Option A is useful when a hardware wallet reuses the same public key in different scripts, but it couldn?t be applied to NOINPUT

3. Is the proposed DUALOUTPUT somehow useful for eltoo? Eltoo use NOINPUT|SINGLE to allow fee pumping, since it is an one-input-one-output tx. This is not possible with the existing LN as the tx is one-input-two-output. If we had DUALOUTPUT which signs the matched and last output, fee-pumping would be possible in the existing LN.

Explicitly committing to the scriptPubKey allows hardware wallet to confirm what it is actually signing (e.g. P2SH-segwit vs. Native-segwit).
>> 3. SIGHASH2_NOINPUT: basically same as BIP118, but the signature commits to both scriptCode and scriptPubKey. This prevents signature replay if the same public key is used in different scripts.

>> 5. SIGHASH2_LASTOUTPUT: signs only the highest index output.
>> 6. SIGHASH2_DUALOUTPUT: signs the matched output and the highest index output. Described by gmaxwell at https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-July/016188.html <https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-July/016188.html>
>> 7. Signing the amount of fees (optional, yes by default). In case of not signing all inputs or outputs, users may still want to commit to a specific fee amount.
>> 8. Signing the witness size (optional, yes by default). While segwit fixed txid malleability, it is not a fix of script malleability. It may cause some trouble if an attacker could bloat the witness and reduce the fee priority of a transaction. Although the witness size is not malleable for most simple scripts, this is not guaranteed for more complex ones. Such kind of size malleability could be avoided if signatures commit to the size of witness.

>> Any suggestions are welcomed. But I have the following questions:
>> 
>> 1. Should NOINPUT commit to scriptCode and/or scriptPubKey? I think it should, because that helps avoid signature replay in some cases, and also lets hardware wallets know what they are signing. I am asking this because BIP118 proposes the opposite. I want to make sure I?m not missing something here.
>> 2. Do we want to add LASTOUTPUT and DUALOUTPUT? Suggested by gmaxwell, an example use case is kickstarter, where individual supporters send money to the last output for a kickstarter project, and send change to the matched output. However, I doubt if this would be actually used this way, because the kickstarter organiser could always take the money before the target is met, by making up the difference with his own input. This is an inherent problem for any anonymous kickstarter scheme. If these new SIGHASHs are not useful in other applications, I am not sure if we should add them.
>> 3. Instead of these restrictive MATCH/LAST/DUALOUTPUT, do we want a fully flexible way to sign a subset of outputs? The indexes of signed outputs are put at the end of the signature, and the signature won?t commit to these index values. Therefore, a third party could collect all transactions of this kind and merge them into one transaction. To limit the sighash cost, number of signed outputs might not be more than 2 or 3. Some potential problems: a) code complexity; b) 1-byte or 2-byte index: 1-byte will limit the number of outputs to 256. 2-byte will use more space even for smaller txs; c) highly variable signature size makes witness size estimation more difficult
>> 4. Should we sign the exact witness size (as proposed), or an upper size limit? Signing an upper limit will take up more space, as the limit has to be explicitly shown in the witness. The overhead could be avoided by showing the limit only if the actual witness size is not equal to the committed limit. However, I tend to keep it simple and sign the exact value. If in a multi-sig setup some signers are unable to accurately estimate the witness size, they should leave this responsibility to the last signer who should know the exact size.

>>> Since 2016, I have made a number of proposals for the next generation of script. Since then, there has been a lot of exciting development on this topic. The most notable ones are Taproot and Graftroot proposed by Maxwell. It seems the most logical way is to implement MAST and other new script functions inside Taproot and/or Graftroot. Therefore, I substantially simplified my earlier proposal on SIGHASH2. It is a superset of the existing SIGHASH and the BIP118 SIGHASH_NOINPUT, with further flexibility but not being too complicated. It also fixes some minor problems that we found in the late stage of BIP143 review. For example, the theoretical (but not statistical) possibility of having same SignatureHash() results for a legacy and a witness transaction. This is fixed by padding a constant at the end of the message so collision would not be possible.

>>> 	? NOSCRIPTCODE: It would be very rare if one could make a signature without knowing what the script is (at least they know the public key).

>>> Legacy SINGLE without matching output: 0x3ff (Not exactly. Both signatures commit to nothing, but the legacy one is valid only without a matched output. Practically, they are both "wildcard" signatures that allow anyone to spend any related UTXO)
>>> Legacy/BIP143 NONE: 0x72 (all input, one sequence, no output, no fee)
>>> Legacy/BIP143 ANYONECANPAY|ALL: 0x46 (one input without index, one sequence, all output, no fee)
>>> Legacy ANYONECANPAY|SINGLE with matching output: 0x64 (one input with index, one sequence, one output, no fee)
>>> Legacy/BIP143 ANYONECANPAY|NONE: 0x76 (one input without index, one sequence, no output, no fee)
>>> BIP143 SINGLE without matching output: 0x62 (all input, one sequence, no output, no fee)
>>> BIP143 ANYONECANPAY|SINGLE with matching output: 0x66 (one input without index, one sequence, one output, no fee)
>>> BIP143 ANYONECANPAY|SINGLE without matching output: 0x66 (one input without index, one sequence, no output, no fee)
>>> BIP118 NOINPUT: 0x14b (no input but with value, no index, no sequence, no fee, no scriptcode)
>>> 
>>> Notes:
>>> 
>>> 1. In legacy and BIP143 SIGHASH, only ALL but not other types implicitly commits to the fee paid.
>>> 2. Legacy SIGHASH always implicitly commits to the input value. BIP143 and BIP118 commits to that explicitly.
>>> 3. Legacy and BIP143 SIGHASH behaves differently in the case of SINGLE without matching output. In legacy SIGHASH it is a true "wildcard signature" that allows anyone to spend any related UTXO. In BIP143 such signature applies only to a specific UTXO.
>>> 4. BIP143 ANYONECANPAY never commits to the input index. Legacy ANYONECANPAY|SINGLE implicitly commits to the input index.
