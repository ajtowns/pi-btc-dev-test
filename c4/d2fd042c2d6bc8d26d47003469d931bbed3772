Subject: [bitcoin-dev] RFC: HD Bitmessage address derivation based on
	BIP-43

The primary purpose is to allow Bitmessage users to benefit from
eternal key backups by generating their addresses from a seed.


In addition, they can use the same seed for a Bitcoin wallet and a
Bitmessage client.


This method also enables future use cases where senders calculate
Bitmessage addresses based on a recipient's extended public key and
some other index value.
