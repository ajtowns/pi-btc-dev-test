That works until another field is added in the same manner.

Implementations are expected to follow the standard logic of

if (more data)
   parse field X
if (more data)
   parse field X+1
if (more data)
   parse field X+2
etc.

Ugly or not, there is no point in changing now.  Updating the version
message to a radically different design, for simply cleanliness
reasons, is not sufficient cause to migrate the entire bitcoin
universe to a new and different version/feature negotiation setup.
