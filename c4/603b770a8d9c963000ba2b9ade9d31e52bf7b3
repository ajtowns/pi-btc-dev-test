Well -dev or both, I dont particularly see a difference at the moment,
and establishing two lists isnt really going to make a difference so
long as Bitcoin Core is the reference client, which it is by defacto.
The risk of having too many lists is interested stakeholders will miss
a discussions. Normal protocol and core discussions are usually pretty
low volume in any case.

I would suggest it's only because there havent been any rules for -dev
that would force general discussion over to the bitcoin list. On IRC
we regularly tell people in #bitcoin-dev they are OT and ask them to
move to #bitcoin and as a result, -dev remains quite clear of chit
chat, #bitcoin has a steady stream of general chatter.

We could reduce the OT/noise of bitcoin-dev list considerably by
offloading the non-technical/academic debate to the bitcoin list. It
just needs a bit of shepherding. I am more than happy to help out.
Especially if the list already exists, we should consider making a
decision now.

Who are the moderators for that list? Do we really want to use
sourceforge or are there alternatives, like another list on
linuxfoundation?

ping @Warren.
