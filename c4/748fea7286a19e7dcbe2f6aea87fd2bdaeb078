RE: splitting off the "send commands to a running bitcoin" :

I'm mildly against it. It would be less confusing for newbies, at the
cost of forcing everybody who has already written backup scripts or
other interact-with-running-bitcoin tools to tweak their code. The
coding will be easy, but do you really want to spend the time to
answer all the "I installed Bitcoin X.Y and now my backup script
doesn't work" questions and modify the wiki pages and ...

I'd rather that time be spent working on any remaining build issues so
we can switch to bitcoin-qt.  I don't care if it is autotools or qmake
or QT creator, I just care that it works on Windows and Linux under
gitian and has clear instructions so I can build it on my Mac.
