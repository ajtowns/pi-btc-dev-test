My last note in this sub-thread.

There are no IANA registry groups, there is no such thing, and no way
to form one. The IETF can ask the IANA to form a registry but these
things take lots of support and take a long time, and these are only
created through standards track RFC. ICANN runs the IANA and there is
no such framework that you elude to. Review

If you are applying for a gTLD, good luck with that.
