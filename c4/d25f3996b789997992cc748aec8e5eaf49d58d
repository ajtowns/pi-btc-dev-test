I'll second that, which is why I've mostly not commented on whether or not particular proposals are good ideas, except in the case where they're obviously broken due to reasons other than the blocksize itself. For instance both of Garzik's proposals and Andresen's BIP101 have serious flaws regardless of your thoughts on the blocksize, which is why I've commented on them. Wuille's OTOH is implemented well, which is why I have not commented about it.

What might be valuable is to ask devs to explain what their threat models are, what should be at the root of their thinking about the blocksize.
