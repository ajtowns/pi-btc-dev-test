This is incompatible with my proposal for fixing the OP_IF/NOTIF malleability in segwit ("MINIMALIF"). In this case only the timeout branch may be executed.

To make it compatible, you may use one of the following 2 scripts:

OP_SIZE OP_0NOTEQUAL
OP_IF
 [HASHOP] <digest> OP_EQUALVERIFY
 <seller pubkey>
OP_ELSE
 <num> [TIMEOUTOP] OP_DROP
 <buyer pubkey>
OP_ENDIF
OP_CHECKSIG

or

OP_IF
 [HASHOP] <digest> OP_EQUALVERIFY
 <seller pubkey>
OP_ELSE
 <num> [TIMEOUTOP] OP_DROP
 <buyer pubkey>
OP_ENDIF
OP_CHECKSIG

The overall witness size are the same for these scripts. They are 1 byte larger than Luke's script, in case MINIMALIF is not enforced.

(btw, the OP_DROP after TIMEOUTOP is missing in Luke's script)
