Oh, and it occured to me: merge-mining is also vulnerable to the exact
same censorship forces. Again, with small blocks running P2Pool is
feasible, and P2Pool does merge-mining just fine. With large blocks it's
easy for the pool to ignore shares that try to merge mine, so your
alt-chains competition is also censored.
