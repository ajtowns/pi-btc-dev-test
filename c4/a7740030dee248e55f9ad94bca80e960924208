It seems laborious to enumerate all the validations that are performed
on a transaction before it can be mined into a block, but for starters
we need to check it isn't a double-spend, and that its signatures
satisfy the outputs' pubkeys.

If you as an SPV node are waiting for unconfirmed transactions to be
relayed to you, you are going to have a slow start in mining those
transactions, decreasing the likelihood of receiving the mining
reward. Nodes should accept the first POW for a transaction and
discard any subsequent ones received.
