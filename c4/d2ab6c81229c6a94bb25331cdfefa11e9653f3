FWIW,

I would fully like to see the consensus stuff split off into a separate organization from everything else. Let XT continue to support additional p2p messages or relay policies or whatever. Let Mike and Gavin argue for their improved wallet or whatever - I have absolutely no problem with that.

But the consensus code should NOT be subject to the same commit policies?and we should make an effort to separate the two clearly. And we should find a way to communicate the difference succinctly and clearly to laypeople (which is something I think the XT opponents have been horrible at doing so far).
