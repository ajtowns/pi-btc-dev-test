Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Segmented Block Relaying BIP draft.
Message-ID: <BA7EEDEA-5A56-42F5-A43D-0D4C9CC99DBC@godofgod.co.uk>

Here is a BIP draft for improving the block relaying and validation so that it can be done in parallel and so that redundancy can be removed. This becomes more beneficial the larger the block sizes are.
