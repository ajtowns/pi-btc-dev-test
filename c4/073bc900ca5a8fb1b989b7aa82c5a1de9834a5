Note how private key birthday is a potential privacy issue in certain cases.
Rare of course, because usually you don't release your private keys! But users
will on occasion have those keys be compromised.

Personally, I'd advocate rounding down to month-level resolution, as that
should be both enough to handle any likely reorg scenario, and it's still a
precision that won't add much extra scanning ot any reasonably old (~1yr)
wallet.

Note also how if transactions created with private keys in a seed use
nLockTime, you can ensure coins won't exist in a block older than the seed
birthday by simply ensuring that nLockTime is set to a more recent date then
that birthday under all circumstances.
