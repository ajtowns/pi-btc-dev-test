The final signature is a signature of the payment request, it is not
part of DNSSEC. So, yes, that signature can be EC.

The DNSSEC proof is used to verify that the public key, which is
recovered from the signature, corresponds to the alias.

The payment requests I am currently playing with have the following values:

pki_type = "dnssec+btc" (btc means that the signature is checked against
a Bitcoin address stored in DNS)
pki_data = the user's alias (DNS key)
