Transaction sizes are still limited to 1MB with this patch.  While this
isn't technically a change, it does mean that both are no longer linked
together.

Since this has no voting step, I assume the intention is that as a
compromise suggestion, it would have full support.

It establishes a precedent for hard forks not to require a vote though.
