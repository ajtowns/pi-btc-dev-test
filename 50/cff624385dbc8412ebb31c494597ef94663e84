As Greg explained to you repeatedly, a softfork won't cause a
non-upgraded full node to start accepting blocks that create more
subsidy than is valid.
It's only the new rule (in this case, BIP65) that they won't validate.
That's very different security from an SPV node, and as Greg also
explained, SPV nodes could be much more secure than bitcoinj nodes
(they could, for example, validate the coinbase transaction of every
block).
If a non-upgraded node it's not a "full node" for you, that's fine,
but it is for everyone else. So please stop confusing other people.
Assuming the majority of the hashrate upgraded, there's almost no risk
for non-upgraded full nodes.

Thanks, I wasn't aware that there was room for new opcodes that
weren't noops already.
Can you give an example of an attack in which a non-upgraded full node
wallet is defrauded with BIP65 but could not with the hardfork
alternative (that nobody seems to be willing to implement)?
Please, don't assume 0 confirmation transactions or similar
unreasonable assumptions (ie see section 11 "Calculations" of the
Bitcoin whitepaper).
