I understand it is not in any way a supported configuration.

Please lets not go into the weeds debating about my reasons.

I actually have nothing against segwit per-se, and think it is clever
tech.  I wish that it, or another malleability fix, had been baked in
from the start.  But it wasn't, and I dislike changing the consensus
rules except if critical flaws are found.


anyway, some of my reasons are:

I am content with status-quo consensus rules.

I see greatest long-term value in a fixed, unchanging set of rules
(though that is outside my control of course).

I have limited bandwidth and resources and prefer 1mb limit for that reason.

Prior to activation, I do not choose to signal for segwit in any way
shape or form.

I realize I could run a pre-segwit node forever, but would like to enjoy
more recent features and otherwise avoid bit-rot.

I am mule-headed and stubborn.  If network-wide activation should
happen, I will most likely upgrade to segwit at some point, but I intend
that point to be at my choosing, not because software defaults did it
for me.

I view it as a little bit of a personal challenge and experiment.

no that thought did not enter my mind.  still not sure I fully grok it
in fact, but no matter.
