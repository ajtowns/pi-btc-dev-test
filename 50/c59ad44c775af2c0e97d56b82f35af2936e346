Eric Voskuil, Alice Larson, others:

Personal attacks or bullying of any kind are not tolerated on this mailing list.

This list is meant to be a low-volume community for technical proposals and discussion regarding Bitcoin. See the archive for say, 2012, for example.

What Peter Todd or anyone else is doing on Twitter or other places is not relevant here. This list is not a pillory for your issues, nor a place to exhibit your personal hobby horses.

Wladimir
