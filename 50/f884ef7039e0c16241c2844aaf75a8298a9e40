I have a possible solution:

Take all public keys encoded in the purpose-specific extended public
keys (m/45') of all cosigners and sort them lexicographically, according
to BIP-45.  Serialize this information and calculate its HASH160
(RIPEMD160 ? HASH256).  Split the output in five 32-bit chunks, setting
the MSB on all of them to 0. Use these 32-bit chunks to build a
derivation path from the purpose-specific extended public keys.  Treat
this derivation path as if it was the purpose-specific extended public
key in BIP-45.

This scheme will avoid public key sharing, and as long as you share your
purpose-specific extended public key only with your cosigners, it should
be relatively hard for a passive observer to link activity between
different cosigning accounts.
