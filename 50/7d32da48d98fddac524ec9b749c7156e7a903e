Indeed, anything which uses P2SH is obviously vulnerable if there is an attack on RIPEMD160 which reduces it's security only marginally. While no one thought hard about these attacks when P2SH was designed, we realized later this was not such a good idea to reuse the structure from P2PKH. Hence why this discussion came up.
