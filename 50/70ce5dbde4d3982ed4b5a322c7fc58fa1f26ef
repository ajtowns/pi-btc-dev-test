As the project is still in "experimental" phase I suppose people can expect
changes like this? And the change is pretty much trivial, and it makes sense
for a future direction (UI<->Wallet in separate processes for security
concerns).

To be honest I feel a bit like every change that I (and I've also heard this
from others) propose is shot down, no matter how well formulated.  This is
actively discouraging developers from joining this project.

Of course it makes sense to be a careful, but the project is not on life
support is it? Satoshi did a great job making the program, but his work was
not perfect, and it makes sense to look ahead a bit.

I think it would be better to switch to two branches, like most other open
source projects I've worked with:

0.3.x -> small, compatible changes, bugfixes, like now
0.4.x -> trunk, more impactful changes, refactorings, eventual major release

Both will obviously be fully compatible on the P2P-level.

I could do the Gitian stuff but not the Mac instructions, as I don't have a
Mac...
