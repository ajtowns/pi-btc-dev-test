Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Multi CSV Transaction
Message-ID: <CAAQs3wucifHfjZ6VJJ2tWL-vzERzL=341aCL666MY+6_vKC-yQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everybody,

I need a little clarity about how OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV) works in
transactions.

Can I use multiple CSV end points as depicted in the figure below? I
basically want to allow different conditions at different delays.

I just want to know if OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY can be used to achieve the
above.

Thank you.

Praveen
