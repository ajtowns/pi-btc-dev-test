Subject: [bitcoin-dev] A conversation with Dan Boneh (2016-08-01)
Message-ID: <CABaSBaxxQW+C+QAL+uYE4htPTFUz9fDdgEHbDmnSpP1Vh8fLDg@mail.gmail.com>

Some Bitcoin developers and miners went to visit with Dan Boneh at Stanford
earlier today, and I thought I would share what we talked about.

Transcript:
http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2016-july-bitcoin-developers-miners-meeting/dan-boneh/

Topics discussed include elliptic curve crypto, ECDSA, Schnorr signatures,
signature aggregation, BLS signature schemes, pairing crypto, group
signatures, block-level signature aggregation, transaction-level signature
aggregation, post-quantum crypto, quantum mining ASICs, provable solvency
schemes, scrypt password hashing, and balloon hashing.

(I would include the text directly but it's nearly 60 kilobytes in size and
past the point where I am presently comfortable with gunking up other
mailboxes.)
