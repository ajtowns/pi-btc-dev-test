Changing the block size is an item for the hard-fork list.  The chance
of the block size limit changing in the short term seems rather low...
 it is a "nuclear option."

Hard-fork requires a very high level of community buy-in, because it
shuts out older clients who will simply refuse to consider >1MB blocks
valid.

Anything approaching that level of change would need some good, hard
data indicating that SatoshiDice was shutting out the majority of
other traffic.  Does anyone measure mainnet "normal tx" confirmation
times on a regular basis?  Any other hard data?

Clearly SatoshiDice is a heavy user of the network, but there is a
vast difference between a good stress test and a network flood that is
shutting out non-SD users.

Can someone please help quantify the situation?  kthanks :)
