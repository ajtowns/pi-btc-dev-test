Payment request expiration was meant to address this.

Adding an optional expiration timestamp to addresses would be
possible, however, it would be a non-backward-compatible change and
lots of software would have to be changed at this point.

In my opinion encouraging the use of the payment protocol and
deprecating the use of addresses is the best way forward, and not just
for this reason.
