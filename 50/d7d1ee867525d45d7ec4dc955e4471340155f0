Is NTRU still an option? My understanding is that NTRUsign, the algorithm to
produce signatures as opposed to encryption, was broken last year:
http://www.di.ens.fr/~ducas/NTRUSign_Cryptanalysis/DucasNguyen_Learning.pdf

Having said that my understanding is also that the break requires a few
thousand signatures, so perhaps for Bitcoin it would still be acceptable given
that we can, and should, never create more than one signature for any given key
anyway. You would be betting that improving the attack from a few thousand
signatures to one is not possible however.

In any case, worst comes to worst there are always lamport signatures. If they
are broken hash functions are broken and Bitcoin is fundementally broken
anyway, though it would be nice to have alternatives that are similar is pubkey
and signature size to ECC.
