Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Tests for Bitcoin QT
Message-ID: <CAPfzCrQoP-9aw2SmoFr=FqANBKEJ-zGeOMv08MjtWv-JdXHFDw@mail.gmail.com>

The Bitcoin QT worked excellently the first time on my Mac.  I was so
surprised to do a pull and compile and bang the new wallet popped up
and was running.  Its much easier than getting it all going from
makefile and CLI.

 However I no longer see the tests subdirectory.  How are the unit
tests handled within this QT framework?
