The first one I was referring to is a *transaction* with "non-standard" sig op 
count, which is AFAIK allowed in blocks, just not accepted by the mainline 
rules. In the second case, that transaction is not tied to a specific block. 
Maybe the person spending it sees it matured beyond 100 confirmations, and you 
only see 99. An attacker could use these things to get nodes to ban each 
other.
