A fork of Matt's proposal converted to GF(2^8) is here:
https://github.com/cetuscetus/btctool/blob/bip/bip-xxxx.mediawiki

Other changes include:
- only six application/version bytes are allocated, which is the
minimum to ensure that the encoded form starts with S in all cases;
- encoded prefixes are SK/SL for a shared private key
(mainnet/testnet) and SS/ST for a shared BIP32 seed;
- the only hash function in use is SHA-256, which is the all-purpose
hash function in the Bitcoin protocol;
- double SHA is used for similarity with Bitcoin, although Jan and I
believe single SHA is enough in this application;
- bias-less encoding of M and x, because there can't be more than 255
shares over GF(2^8).
