Hello Matt and Daniele,

The effect of block compression protocols is included.  This is what I call the "coding gain" and use the Greek letter "gamma" to represent. 

As long as the block solution announcements contain information (i.e., Shannon Entropy) about the transactions included in a block, then the fee market will be "healthy" according to the definitions given in the linked paper (see below).  This is the case right now, this is the case with your relay network, and this would be the case using any implementation of IBLTs that I can imagine, so long as miners can still construct blocks according to their own volition.  The "healthy fee market" result follows from the Shannon-Hartley theorem; the SH-theorem describes the maximum rate at which information (Shannon Entropy) can be transmitted over a physical communication channel.   

 https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf

I've exchanged emails with Greg Maxwell about (what IMO is) an academic scenario where the block solutions announcements contain no information at all about the transactions included in the blocks.  Although the fee market would not be healthy in such a scenario, it is my feeling that this also requires miners to relinquish their ability to construct blocks according to their own volition (i.e., the system would already be centralized).  I look forward to a white paper demonstrating otherwise!

Best regards,
Peter
