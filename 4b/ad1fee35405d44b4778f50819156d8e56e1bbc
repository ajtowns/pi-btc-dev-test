Makes sense.

In an idealized model of a client as a set of private keys, they will
want to (a) notice new activity on these keys, (b) notice increased
confidence on existing transactions with those keys [confirmations],
and (c) be able to submit to the network new transactions.  Your
proposal covers those bases, I believe.
