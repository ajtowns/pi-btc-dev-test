> but allow meaningful relief to transaction volume pressure in response to true market demand

If blocksize can only increase then it's like a market that only goes
up which is unrealistic. Transaction will volume ebb and flow
significantly. Some people have been looking at transaction volume
charts over time and all they can see is an exponential curve which
they think will go on forever, yet nothing goes up forever and it will
go through significant trend cycles (like everything does). If you
dont want to hurt the fee market, the blocksize has to be elastic and
allow contraction as well as expansion.
