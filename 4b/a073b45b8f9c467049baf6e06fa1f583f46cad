If I remember the details correctly you could combine (lagrange
interpolation) the results of m smaller encryptions/signatures without ever
sharing the secret key share itself. No idea if that is possible with ecdsa
at all, but it sure would solve quite a few problems, as it would allow
several independent servers to share a secret key, sign transactions with
it, but no m-1 compromised machines would endanger the whole balance.
I will definitely look into it when I'm back from holidays.

Cheers,
Cdecker
