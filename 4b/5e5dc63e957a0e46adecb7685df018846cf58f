Subject: [Bitcoin-development] HD wallet import strategies
Message-ID: <E677DCDC-C139-4A8F-B1A9-0D1582365688@me.com>

Hi all,

We've been having a heated discussion on HD wallet import strategies on bitcointalk and I was wondering what the people on bitcoin-dev had to say about the subject. 

So I have a few questions and would love to hear your thoughts on them:

1) What information do you consider absolutely essential when importing an HD wallet root key?
2) If you already have an HD wallet import function, can you give a rough description of how it works?
3) Do you think it would be wise to set up some sort of guidelines to ensure that different HD wallet implementations will be able to import each others HD wallet root keys?
4) Anything else on the subject you consider important?

Thanks in advance,

Jean-Paul
