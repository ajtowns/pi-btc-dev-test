Interesting, basically a proof of non-ownership :), a proof that the
hardware wallet doesn't own the address.

But shouldn't x be public, so that the device can verify the signature?
Can you expand on this, what is exactly signed with which key and how is
it checked?

One also has to make sure that it's not possible to reuse signatures as
ownership proof that were made for a different purpose.
