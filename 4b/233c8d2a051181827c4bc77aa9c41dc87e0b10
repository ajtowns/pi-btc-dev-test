No strong opinion, but I'd rather not change it anymore, as I don't see the
point. Any data you would want to encode there can be moved to the witness
at 1/4 the cost and replaced by a 256-bit hash. If the data is 43 bytes or
higher, that is even cheaper. The only thing that cannot be in the hash is
metadata to indicate what hashing/rule scheme itself is used. I think 68
bits (OP_n + 8 bytes) for that is plenty.
