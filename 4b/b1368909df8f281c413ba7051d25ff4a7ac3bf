Replying to the "fee" part of BIP75 (which as already noted should go to
a different BIP number imho):

It makes to sense to let the payee define a fee *rate*. The payee
doesn't know anything about how the payer's wallet is structured. In
extreme cases, as a payer I would keep all my tiny UTXOs (which would be
unspendable in a economic way) for the one payee who is willing to pay a
high enough rate...

Rather, I propose an absolute amount that the payee is willing to cover
should be declared.

Also, in order to avoid disputes I suggest the amount should be deducted
from the BIP70 payment message amount already. A wallet which
understands BIP75fee would add these two up for *display* puposes only.
The wallet should continue to use the existing fee policies. If it can
send the amount as specified by BIP70 and the fee is below the BIP75fee
amount, it would not mention any fees to the user. If it exceeds, it
would display just the exceeding amount.
