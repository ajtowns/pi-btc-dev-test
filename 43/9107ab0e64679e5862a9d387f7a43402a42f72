Might be worthwhile to also write an "Expectations for DNSSeed users"
outlining what security properties the seeds actually have, and what
kind of attacks are possible. Many users would be better served with
seeds that offer authenticated and encrypted connections to the seeds
for instance. (esp. if they're using authed/encrypted connections to
nodes, e.g. Tor hidden services)

Along the lines of my above point, for Bitcoin Core users of the
DNSSeeds what constitutes a "functioning" Bitcoin node is much more
broad than what other users might need.

Note that singling out a group of hosts to receive different results
with DNS is especially difficult as you'll be usually singling out
different ISP's rather than hosts themselves. That said if we ever start
operating HTTPS or similar seeds this expectation will become even more
relevant for them.

I'll let others refine the exact wording. but I broadly agree with these
rules.

For the testnet DNS seeds - IE my one - my thoughts are the rules should
be identical. Most of the above is related to privacy rather than
security, which apply equally well on testnet. While there have been
suggestions to use the testnet seeds for testing vulnerabilities, the
public discussion clause should suffice to allow those exceptions. I
also suspect that vulnerabilities are likely to be dismissed by a large
part of the community if demonstrated with DNSSeed operator
co-operation.
