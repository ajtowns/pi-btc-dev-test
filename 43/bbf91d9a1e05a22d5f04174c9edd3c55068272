What compromise? I haven't seen a specific proposal that could be turned
into a pull request.

NO I AM NOT.

I simulated a variety of connectivities; see the .cfg files at
  https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin_miningsim

The results I give in the "are bigger blocks better" blog post are for
WORST CASE connectivity (one dominant big miner, multiple little miners,
big miner connects to only 30% of little miners, but all the little miners
connected directly to each other).

Again, I did not simulate all miners directly connected to each other.

I will note that miners are VERY HIGHLY connected today. It is in their
best interest to be highly connected to each other.

Really? How is that easily subject to change? If it is easily subject to
change, do bigger blocks have any effect? Why are 1MB blocks not subject to
change?

I talk about "what if your government bans Bitcoin entirely" here:
   http://gavinandresen.ninja/big-blocks-and-tor

... and the issues are essentially the same, independent of block size.
