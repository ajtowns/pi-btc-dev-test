Different users could have different gap limit requirements.  20 seems very
low as the default.

A merchant could easily send 20 addresses in a row to customers and none of
them bother to actually buy anything.

Setting the gap limit to high is just a small extra cost in that case.

Bip-32 serialization doesn't have a way of adding meta data though.
