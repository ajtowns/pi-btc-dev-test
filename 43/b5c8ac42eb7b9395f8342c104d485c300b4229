Say you generate a child key using the path m/6'/4'/7'/99'/0/196, which 
is what your proposed path structure would be, and it results in the 
address 1DpY7PtPVURvjrGsdAjbZAZ7cL9GD8tc5w.

When the wallet notices a transaction in the blockchain that has 
1DpY7PtPVURvjrGsdAjbZAZ7cL9GD8tc5w as an output, it's going to have to 
lookup the address within its database to get the values 6/4/7/99/0/196, 
as there's no way to retrieve them from just the address.  So 
technically, you might as well just use m/account'/change/index if using 
hardened child keys, or m/change/index if not, as recommended, because 
the wallet will still function the exact same way.
