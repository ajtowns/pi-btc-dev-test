It's done that way because it was originally registered by Satoshi. It's
now controlled by Sirius, who doesn't really take part in the project
anymore.

I bring this up because of the recent bitcointalk fiasco. AFAIK the domains
are registered and controlled in the same way. It's likely that the current
registrar isn't very secure.
