That assumes you already have a connection to the peer in question.
As I understand it, the service bits are propagated as part of the address, 
so you can see at a glance which nodes you want to connect to for some 
special service. Passing a huge list along might be unwieldy (though it 
makes sense for protocol changes that don't add new services).
