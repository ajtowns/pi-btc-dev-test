This is the work model I use:
  git clone git://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
  cd bitcoin
  git remote add stable git://gitorious.org/+bitcoin-stable-developers/bitcoin/bitcoind-stable.git
  git remote add personal git at github.com:YOURNAME/bitcoin.git

With this, you can use "git fetch --all" to update your copy of the remote
branches, and access them as "origin/master", "stable/0.6.x", etc; and push
personal branches using "git push personal <branch>"
