Don't read too much into what I said; under normal circumstances when a
Bitcoin node isn't being attacked, there will be plenty of spare
capacity for SPV nodes. All I'm suggesting is that we make sure serving
those nodes doesn't come at the expense of maintaining consensus -
mainly distributing new blocks around the network so the blockchain
keeps moving forward. (something many SPV peers can help with anyway)

I'd much rather my Android wallet take a long time to sync up, than
blocks get re-organized because miners found themselves separated from
one another, let along someone clever using that to do double-spend
attacks during those re-orgs. After all, I can always find a private
node to connect to that won't be overloaded because it doesn't accept
connections from anonymous users. It's also easy to just use really
basic measures to limit abuse, like "sign up with your bitcointalk"
account, or "pay 10 cents for an account to discourage spammers"

Anyway all things less likely to be needed if attackers know all they
are going to manage to do is inconvenience people temporarily because
the network itself will keep running.
