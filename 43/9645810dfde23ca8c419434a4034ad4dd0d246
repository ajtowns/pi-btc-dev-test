Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Looking for a good bitcoin script decompiler
	in Python
Message-ID: <CAJ2OvpgLaD3HKqQ_wqbmv6+7ZXWtXMFeHkwKUVOX4ahCZSU8Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to find a good python script that will take the hash of the
locking and
unlocking tx scripts and output the actual op codes.

Any ideas where to look?

Thanks,
