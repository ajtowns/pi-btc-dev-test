Because if you just want bitcoin p2p over SSL... just start up stunnel
on another port. Done. You've still solved nothing about the problem
of discovery issue.

That isn't so. If a node is reliably rogue I can go manually gather
evidence and people can manually take action against it.  Consider the
DNSseeds, right now fraud proofs really wouldn't matter? the limited
amount of trust put in those things is based not on "oh no, nodes will
ignore you in the future if you're bad", it's based on the ability of
misconduct to sully the operator's reputation.

But without non-repudiation the ability to tie reputation to good
behavior is fairly limited especially if they perform targeted
attacks. "Wasn't me"

Instead? I'd argue that non-repudiation is always useful when there is
trust. It's things like fidelity bonds? a trust generator that depend
on automatic enforcement? that are only useful with fraud proofs.

Yea, indeed, per-node keys are useful for a bunch of things. Care is
needed to avoid problems like deanonymizing use over tor with them.
