Consensus is not trivial. I think documentation is important, even if
it seems simple to some.
Personally, I don't care too much where to place the documentation,
but the BIPs repo seems a good place, since it also hosts other
informational documents.

To prevent "two BIPs for every protocol change", related buried
deployments could be bundled. E.g. the ISM BIP 90 change.

Sufficiently large to prevent potential bike-shedding. The expected
number of blocks in two weeks could be considered a lower bound. Then
multiply that by 10 or 20.

Note that a checkpoint *freezes* the chain completely at a given
height. Buried deployments are *not* checkpoints.

Also note that buried deployments only make sense after a protocol
upgrade has happened (i.e. a soft fork or hard fork). If a miner has
the resources to cause a chain split, they could trivially do that
even in the complete absence of buried deployments. Buried deployments
are *not* a solution to 50% attacks.

Please note that a buried deployment can very well be a soft fork. I
think this makes it even clearer, that such a label makes no sense for
buried deployments.
