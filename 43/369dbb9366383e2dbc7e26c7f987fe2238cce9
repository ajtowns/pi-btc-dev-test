Subject: [bitcoin-dev] RFC for BIP: Derivation scheme for
 P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH based accounts

This works for segwit version 1 with the addition of also using a different
chain id.

I presume that segwit version 2 will be implementing schnorr signatures.
What do we know about the likely implementation details? Is there any way
to avoid using a third derivation path to support it?
