Hi Jeff,

such a vote is up there since March:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=149150.0

Votes are in favor of it.

Advantages are obvious:

1. having satoshi as 1/100 of the main unit is familiar to people like USD and cent
2. All existing financial software can deal/store big numbers but typically only 2 decimals.
3. Split could be linked with the introduction of the ISO code in one step.

Lets get it finally done.
