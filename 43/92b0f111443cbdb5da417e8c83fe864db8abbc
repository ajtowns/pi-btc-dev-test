Ideally you should not reuse the address, so the website will need more
addresses or bip32 xpub anyway.

By using wallet address and accidentally using such address in some
transaction, you may be leaking your identity with with other business -
think about Silkroad (sorry Mike :-).

 By using derived key, you can be sure your identity won't be linked with
any other activity on the internet.

I mean, what is the difference between doing that, and id with a login/pass

== your identity.
*)  There's plenty of websites which do need authentication but don't need
to know your bank account / bitcoin address at all. Facebook, Gmail,
Twitter ...

Ideally, the user should not care about "what address do I use for this
service", because in the future user should not care about addresses at all
(handling of private keys is already eliminated by bip32, handling of raw
addresses may be eliminated soon by bip70 or similar solutions).

I can imagine that the private/public data will be derived automatically
from some secret master key (ideally derived from bip32 seed, which is
already secured well by the user) and the URL of the service.
