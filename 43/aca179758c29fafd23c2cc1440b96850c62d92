Sorry this was meant for the list:

There are only 32 bits in the version field. If you're going to spend a bit
for perpetuity to indicate whether or not a feature is active, you'd better
have a good reason to make that feature optional.

I haven't seen a compelling use case for having BIP 68 be optional in that
way. As you note, BIP 68 semantics is already optional by toggling the most
significant bit, and that doesn't permanently burn a version bit.
