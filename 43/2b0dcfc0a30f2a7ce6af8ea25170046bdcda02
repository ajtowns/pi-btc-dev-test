PR welcome.

See https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/bip-mmhf/bip-mmhf.mediawiki#Merkle_tree_algorithm

But yes, the 448 bits total target is to optimise the tree-building.

It already is. This is a primary goal of the new protocol.

Adding new trees means more hashing to validate blocks, so it'd be better to 
keep it at a minimum.
