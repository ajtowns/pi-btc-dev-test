It has been, but there are probably many people like you who have not
bothered researching who may also be curious.

Because doing so would be both unnecessary and ineffective.

Unnecessary because we can very likely eliminate malleability without
changing what is signed. It will take time, but we have been
incrementally moving towards that, e.g. v0.8 made many kinds of
non-canonical encoding non-standard.

Ineffective? at least as you describe it? because the signatures
_themselves_ are malleable.
