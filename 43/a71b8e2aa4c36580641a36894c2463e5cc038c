I now have an 1.8 ghz p3 celeron (128k cache) which should be
substantially slower than your machine, running vintage 2.6.20 linux.
Unfortunately I forgot to turn on timestamp logging so I don't know
how long it took to sync the chain, but it was less than two days as
that was the span between when I checked on it. It's staying current
just fine.

Again, I encourage you to investigate your software configuration.
