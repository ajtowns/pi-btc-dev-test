+1 agree with Mike on everything

A couple of points:

1. bitcoinity already switched to mbtc aka millitbits (
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MilliBit ) and it was positively recieved, they
got quite a few donations

2. If you watch Gavin's talk at the CFR he suggests the community comes to
a consensus through implementations rather than top down decision making
(If I understood correctly)

I think it's up to wallet maintainers whether to switch the default.
