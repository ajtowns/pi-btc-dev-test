Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin is an experiment. Why don't we have an
 experimental hardfork?

One of your goals is "show the world that reaching consensus for a
Bitcoin hardfork is possible", right?
BIP99 can achieve that goal without touching the block size (thus
probably less controversial).

The data can be collected using testchains. See #6382

That makes the data less interesting, doesn't it?

It wouldn't defeat the "show the world that reaching consensus for a
Bitcoin hardfork is possible" objective though. But again, we don't
need to touch the block size to achieve that goal.

> That's why I suggest 1.5MB.

But that wouldn't be uncontroversial (unless it was accompanied with
data that somehow quantifies the risks, in which case maybe another
bigger size is acceptable).

Yes, emergency hardforks are a different case as explained in BIP99's draft.
In any case, " we all agree that some kind of block size hardfork will
happen on June 2016" it's clearly false since I can find many
counter-examples besides myself.

I don't think giving 1 year for "everybody in the world" to upgrade is
an "ultra-long" period.
I'm proposing 5 years for the hardfork proposed in bip99.
I do think softforks are safer than hardforks, that doesn't mean
softforks don't have serious risks as well.

I disagree with this conclusion as well (it doesn't follow from the
first sentence, non sequitur).
