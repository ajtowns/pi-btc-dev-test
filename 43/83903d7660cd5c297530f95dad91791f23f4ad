Hi Byron, 

I've been using shadow a bit-- I think these simulators are important for testing, but Shadow, at least, certainly seems to have limitations, in some crucial respects.  Running shadow w Tor (which is only logical, because many BCT transactions transpire over Tor) is not as 'light' as presented and slows my own box down quite a bit, so the stats can't possibly be accurate... I don't know if this answers any questions or if you've had this experience at all -- perhaps it is negligible on a more powerful machine than my own-- or perhaps there is an adjustment still unaccounted?

Regards,
Nina K
