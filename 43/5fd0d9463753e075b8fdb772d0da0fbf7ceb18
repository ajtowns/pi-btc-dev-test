I agree, it is definitely tractable.

If Bitcoin was being designed from scratch, it could be made even easier.

As things stand, the extra commitment information needs to be added to
extra trees, which themselves need to be checked.

The "prover", in your example, should ideally store additional meta-data
along with each block.

If P2SH was made mandatory, then much of the transaction validation could
be performed on the transaction alone.

Both the signature and the public key would be included in the spending
transaction.
