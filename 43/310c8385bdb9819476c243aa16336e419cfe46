Agreed.

In contrast, BIP37 as used today is totally decentralized, and can me 
made much more secure, private, and scalable -- without giving up the 
utility of unconfirmed transactions.

Please don't read into this statement a belief that all the coffees 
should go on the chain, or that the security or privacy of BIP37 compare 
favorably to any other particular thing.
