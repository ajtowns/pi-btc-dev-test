I'm cracking my head for many months with the idea of using TREZOR for web
auth purposes. Unfortunately I'm far from any usable solution yet.

My main comments to your BIP: Don't use bitcoin addresses directly and
don't encourage services to use this "login" for financial purposes. Mike
is right, mixing authentication and financial services is wrong. Use some
function to generate other private/public key from bitcoin's seed/private
key to not leak bitcoin-related data to website.

Cheers,
Marek
