Not entirely correct, no. Edge cases also matter. Segwit is described as
4MB because that is the largest possible combined block size that can be
constructed. BIP 102 + segwit would allow a maximum relay of 8MB. So you
have to be confident that an 8MB relay size would be acceptable, even if a
block full of actual transactions would be closer to 3.5MB.
