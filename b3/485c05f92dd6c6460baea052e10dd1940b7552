With lots of people having access to 100TH+ there's not really much 
'cost' to doing a 51% attack on an alt-coin beyond a short-term 
diversion away from 'profitable' mining.

At least by supporting merged mining, more miners are likely to 
'support' multiple coin types, thus making a 51% attack from an 
individual/group less straightforward.

Exactly.
