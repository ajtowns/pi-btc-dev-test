Along the lines of my recent post on blockchain data:

Is it going to be possible to do partial prefix queries on that tree?

Also have you considered creating per-block indexes of all
scriptPubKeys, spent or unspent, queryable via the same partial prefix
method?

It'd be very good to test this stuff thoroughly on Electrum first and
get a feel for the performance and usability before any soft-fork to
make it a miner commitment.

Similarly a C++ implementation should be simply added to Bitcoin Core as
a bloom filter replacement and made available over the P2P network.
