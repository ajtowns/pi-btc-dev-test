Dear Chris,

> I think this is an unfair characterization. You have to opt into using drivechains.

I have heard this nonsense repeated countless times in order to justify adopting Drivechain.

This is not how security works.

A child can "opt-in" to using a loaded gun, but is it a good idea to make it easy for them to do that?

No.

This is effectively the same thing Drivechains is doing.

It is a request to modify the Bitcoin protocol to make it easy for Bitcoin users to give their Bitcoins to miners.

Does that sound like a good idea to anyone?

If so, please leave, you are compromising Bitcoin's security.

Security is about making it difficult to shoot yourself in the face.

If I design a car that has a button that randomly causes the brakes to give out if pressed, is that a good idea? Can I justify pushing for such a "feature" just because it's "opt-in"?

No. That is fallacy.

It is not how secure systems are designed.

It is how *insecure* systems are designed.

Sure, happy to, as soon as I have it written up in detail.

Kind regards,

As Pieter Wuille stated earlier in this thread (and Paul has stated all along), drivechain outputs have a different security model than other contracts. Namely they are controlled by miners. I think we can all agree this is unfortunate, but it is the current reality we live in. I look forward to the day we can solve the 'ownership' problem so we can have trustless interoperable blockchains, but that day is not today.

I guess we can argue if there is any difference between an obvious robbery vs a hidden robbery, but I think if we have to pick one or the other the choice is clear to me. Other designs (that I'm aware of) for sidechains had attack vectors that weren't so obvious.
