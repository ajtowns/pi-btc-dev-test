You can just remove my assertion about the likeliness of the need of
sub-satoshis and the main claim still stands.

Fair enough, not US-centric but western-centric then.
In any case the "3000 micros will look like expensive" claim is still
very relative.

No, it's not. That's what I said the current adoption by some wallets
and services was the only valid argument immediately after dismantling
the actual fallacy.
Did you missed that last sentence or are you intentionally using a
straw man argument?

In summary, yes, that's point is valid, I'm not saying it isn't. I
just wanted to keep us away from the rest argument but pointing out
they are not logic.
I repeat, that's the ONLY valid argument I've heard so far.
