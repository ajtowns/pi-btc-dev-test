I suppose it would make sense for clients to be able to reject blocks that
they already have, if that's not currently possible.

You don't need a BIP if you want to somehow fetch the (initial) block chain
outside the bitcoin protocol. You could download it from some http server
or even pass it along on an USB stick. Then with a simple client change you
can import it: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/883 .

If you're behind such a slow internet connection, and concerned about every
bit of bandwidth, it is better to run a lightweight node. For example,
Electrum.

Even if you could reduce the wasted bandwidth a bit by puzzling around with
partial blocks, the download will still be substantial (and that's going to
get worse before it gets better).
