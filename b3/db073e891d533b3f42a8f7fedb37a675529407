Sure, I meant HTTP as the underlying protocol.
TLS/SSL should of course be required in some form.

JSON-RPC won't go on forever. In any case, bitcoind's use of JSON-RPC is 
exactly why I (and many other developers) have come to the realization how 
poorly supported JSON really is. Most of the common languages do have a 
library, but almost all of them have one issue or another (particularly around 
the very undefined Number type).

XML shares the same binary-data problem as JSON, too.
As slush mentioned, no additional serialization is necessary anyway.

Because computers work with binary. I don't think anyone wants to implement a 
fully functional script assembler just to send funds.

This suggests you need to learn more about how Bitcoin works ;)
