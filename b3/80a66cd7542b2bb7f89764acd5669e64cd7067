A very well written paper, thank you for putting it together and sharing.

Given it's the 6 year birthday of satoshi's white paper, I just read
through it again.

I find it interesting that bitcoin is never defined in Satoshi's paper,
indeed, it never appears after the first word.

The term Electronic Coin is defined.

The terminology of bitcoin / altcoin / altchain / blockchain in this paper
still leaves me slightly uneasy, and I try to use the terms electronic coin
and electronic cash, more often.

If satoshi were to come back and continue his work, would it be an altcoin,
would it be "The" blockchain, would it be bitcoin, or would what we know as
bitcoin become an alt.  I suspect these questions are nothing more than
academic curiosity.

But I think I'll get more used to it over time :)

In any case, happy birthday "bitcoin" :)
