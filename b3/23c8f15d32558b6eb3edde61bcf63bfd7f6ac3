This is a much more reasonable position. I wish this had been starting
point of this discussion instead of "the block size limit must be
increased as soon as possible or bitcoin will fail".
If the only fear about not increasing the block size fast enough is
that fees may rise, pieter wouldn't had to repeatedly explain that for
any reasonable block size some use case may fill the blocks rapidly.

This sounds good overall but I'm afraid you are oversimplifying some things.
Centralization pressure not only comes from global average bandwidth
costs and block propagation times is not the only concern.
Here's an extreme example: [1]
But anyway, yes, I agree, ANY metric would be better than nothing (the
current situation).

Given that for any non-absurdly-big size some transactions will
eventually be priced out, and that the consensus rule serves for
limiting mining centralization (and more indirectly centralization in
general) and not about trying to set a given average transaction fee,
I think the current level of mining centralization will always be more
relevant than the current fee level when discussing any change to the
consensus rule to limit centralization (at any point in time).
In other words, the question "can we change this without important
risks of destroying the decentralized properties of the system in the
short or long run?" should be always more important than "is there a
concerning rise in fees to motivate this change at all?".

As said, I would always consider the centralization risks first: I'd
rather have a $5/tx decentralized Bitcoin than a Bitcoin with free
transactions but effectively validated (when they validate blocks they
mine on top of) by around 10 miners, specially if only 3 of them could
easily collude to censor transactions [orphaning any block that
doesn't censor in the same manner]. Sadly I have no choice, the later
is what we have right now. And reducing the block size can't guarantee
that the situation will get better or even that fees could rise to
$5/tx (we just don't have that demand, not that it is a goal for
anyone). All I know is that increasing the block size *could*
(conditional, not necessarily, I don't know in which cases, I don't
think anybody does) make things even worse.

On the other hand, I could understand people getting worried if fees
where as high as $5/tx or even 20 cent/tx but we're very far away from
that case. How can low subsidies (a certainty) be "too far in the
future to worry about it" but $5/tx, 20 cent/tx or even 5 cent/tx an
urgent concern? For all I know, 5 cent/tx may not happen in the next
25 years: it may never happen. And if it happens, to me it will be a
symptom of Bitcoin success, even for others it means that Bitcoin has
become a "high value settlement network".
To the question

- At which minimum mining fee rate will you urge others to change the
consensus rules to increase the block size?

I'm very sorry, but my answer is:

- I honestly don't know, that may never happen.

What I can tell you is this: I will never be worried about "too high
fees" while the fees remain at 0 (null, zero, nothing, cero, nada,
zilch).
That's right, no matter what wallet's defaults chose for their users,
no matter what the minimum relay fee policy does to the "fee market"
and how much urgent transactions pay in fees; the fact remains that in
practice non-urgent transactions usually (when the raw transaction's
structure it's appropriate) don't have to pay fees.

I'm still missing an answer from the "big blocks size side" to the
following question (which I have insistently repeated with various
permutations):

If "not now" when will it be a good time to let fees rise above zero?
After the next subsidy halving? After 4 more subsidy halvings (ie
about 13 years from now, subsidy = 1.5625 btc/block )? After your
grandmother abandons her national currency and uses Bitcoin for
everything? Never?

ANY answer (maybe with the exception of the last one) would be less
worrying than silence.

I really appreciate your efforts to mediate in this dispute and I
honestly hope that my previous answer is useful as it is.

Just replace 1MB with ANY size.
But, yes, please, when will you consider a size to be too dangerous
for centralization?
Why 20 GB would have been safe but 21 GB wouldn't have been (or the
respective maximums and respective +1)?

Note that "Never, 20GB was just a number closer to infinity than 1MB
and I hoped that could had been voluntarily accepted by users. What I
really want is to completely remove this consensus rule forever." is a
perfectly valid answer. It just means that I will agree with people
that think this way as explained in [1] (yes, not even after
superluminal communication).

As an less relevant note, I feel extremely uncomfortable about being
included in the "1MB advocates" group. As I've tried to explain
several times, 1 is to me an arbitrary number like any other (at most,
the canonical arbitrary number), and so it is 1000000
(MAX_BLOCK_SIZE). I rarely like being grouped or labelled, but maybe
something more accurate like "not-recklessly-change-consensus-rules
advocates" would help.
There's nothing special about 1MB apart from being the current rule,
so I don't think the number is that much relevant to the discussion.
Grouping anyone that has raised any concern about rising the consensus
block size limit as "the 1MBers" is about as fair as grouping anyone
that has ever proposed a rise in the maximum size as "the 20GBers"
(specially when there's people that belong to both groups
simultaneously, like Pieter Wuille who started this thread, and whose
proposal we're supposed to be discussing).
