There were talks about implementing spv mode for bitcoin core without using
bloom filters. Less efficient because it downloads full blocks, but better
for privacy. Perhaps other spv implementations should consider doing the
same instead of committing the filters in the block?

Now I feel I was missing something. I guess you can download the whole
block you're interested in instead of only your txs and that gives you
privacy.
But how do you get to know which blocks are you interested in?

If the questions are too basic or offtopic for the thread, I'm happy
getting answers privately  (but then maybe I get them more than once).

It's easy enough to mark a transaction as "pending". People with bank
accounts are familiar with the concept.

Although the risk of accepting gossip information from multiple random
peers, in the case where the sender does not control the receivers network
is still minimal. Random node operators have no incentive to send fake
transactions, and would need to control all the nodes a client connects to,
and find a non-false-positive address belonging to the victims wallet.

It's not impossible, but it's non trivial, would only temporarily show a
pending transaction, and provide no benefit to the node operator. There are
much juicier targets for an attacker with the ability to sybil attack the
entire bitcoin p2p network.
