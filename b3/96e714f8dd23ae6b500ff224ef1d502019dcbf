This probably wouldn't work as a drop-in replacement, but having the
identifier of the chosen wordlist be part of the mnemonic might work?
Perhaps the raw seed would then be [hash of chosen dictionary]+[sequence of
word indexes].

The user experience then involves always selecting a dictionary by name. I
also suggest maintaining an official list of named dictionaries.

The purpose of including the dictionary in the seed is so that if you use
the last word as a checksum, you also can verify that the dictionary
selection is correct as well as the word sequence.

This allows substitution of words to other languages by manually specifying
a different input dictionary, but you would then have to remember both the
seed language and the translated language so you can specify both
correctly.

The user experience here matches your option 1, while the implementation
matches option 2.

If you remove specification of the seed's original language, you would need
auto detection during entry when the raw seed is just the index. I do not
recommend trying that, especially if any language would end up with
multiple competing dictionaries. Even more so if there's many related
languages which might collide (like all the Latin languages, or even US vs
UK English...).
