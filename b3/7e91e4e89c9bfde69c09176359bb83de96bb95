Thank-you for your prompt response,

I believe I must have a different prospective of Bitcoin to you.  Ideologically I don?t agree that miners can be passive participants in the Bitcoin Network; and I certainly don?t see them acting as passive participants in the Bitcoin Community now.

The miners are very much political actors.  Hence why I fail to take-to-heart your concern "that the proposal will reject the blocks of passive participants?.

With AsicBoost, there are three miner groups: Those who use it (and have legal sanction to do so); Those who use it (without legal sanction); and those who don?t use it.  If SegWit didn?t directly affect miners, then one could possibly claim that there could be an ideal passive participant miner in reality. However since your important revelations on AsicBoost: SegWit cannot be a ?passive? option for miners.

Hence, I don?t care about orphaning the blocks of of the theoretical "passive participant? miner. As I have no logical reasoning to suggest one could exists; and a large amount of evidence to suggesting one dose not exit.


On BIP 16 vs. BIP 17;  I cannot see how BIP 148 similar engineering tradeoffs.  Is there any long-term ?technical debt? from BIP 148 that I?m unaware of that could be similar to BIP 16?


On the Drama:  Well 100M USD p/a can pay for lots of Drama; Hence going back to the first point: The miners are not passive participants when it comes to *any* form of activation of SegWit.

Cameron.
