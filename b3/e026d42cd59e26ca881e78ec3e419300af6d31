"This is already possible. Just nLockTime your withdrawls for some future
block. Don't sign any transaction that isn't nLockTime'd at least N blocks
beyond the present tip."

This would have prevented the Bitfinex hack if BitGo did this, but it
wouldn't have helped if the Bitfinex offline key had been compromised
instead of BitGo doing the 2nd sig.  In the BFX hack the TXNs were signed
by Bitfinex's hot key and BitGo's key, they required 2 of 2.

If I'm understanding correctly, what Matthew is proposing is a new type of
UTXO that is only valid to be spent as an nLockTime transaction and can be
reversed by some sort of RBF-type transaction within that time period, I
believe.

But I don't think this will work. What do you do if the keys are
compromised?  What's to stop the attacker from locking the coins up
indefinitely by repeatedly broadcasting a refund transaction each time you
try to spend to an uncompromised address?

You'd need a third distinct key required for the refund TXN that's separate
from the keys used to sign the initial nLockTime TXN.  And the refund TXN
would need to be able to go to a new address entirely.
