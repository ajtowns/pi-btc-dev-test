That would be very wrong and cause a lot of problems and 'political
chaos' without solving at least one (technical) problem in exchange.

Bitcoin Core is a good quality code. It is open source and free.
Anyone can contribute and submit small changes, improvements.
Controversial changes are not easily merged not because the
maintainers do not want, but because they represent a threat to the
entire ecosystem, one way or the other. We have to very carefully
balance the gains and the risks. If we try to never reach a consensus
on purpose, this will only cause instability, and a possible result
could be that we will end up having many more weaker implementations
running in the network, decreasing the security overall and for everyone.

While I do agree with some of your points of view and I am happy to
see you advocate for 'more decentralization', please let me point you
in a better direction (I think): there is a much bigger problem than >
~90% of the full nodes running Bitcoin Core software - it is
*centralized mining (e.g. a lot of hashing power behind a single full
mining node)*.
