In order for any blocksize increase to be agreed upon, more consensus is
needed.  The proportion of users believing no blocksize increases are
needed is larger than the hardfork target core wants(95% consensus).  The
proportion of users believing in microtransactions for all is also larger
than 5%, and both of those groups may be larger than 10% respectively.  I
don't think either the Big-blocks faction nor the low-node-costs faction
have even a simple majority of support.  Getting consensus is going to be a
big mess, but it is critical that it is done.
