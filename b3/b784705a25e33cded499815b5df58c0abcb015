BitPay noticed this detail last week.  We were noticing that some
transactions were not even reaching our bitcoind border routers (edge
nodes), due to low/no fees.  That led to a long discussion of all
things fee-related.  SPV fees are a big issue.  Getting
child-pays-for-parent in some form out to miners is another.  Getting
a smart, dynamic fee market Gavin mentions is a big need.
