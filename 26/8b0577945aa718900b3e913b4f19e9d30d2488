An update on the homomorphic coins, some more math validation & a test
implementation needs to be done, but a surprisingly good outcome so far of
predicted 2.5kB homomorphic valued coin.  Only coin splitting has to incur
the 2.5kB range proof.  Coin adding, full spending and mining is "free",
because adding existing range proofed and validated coins cant overflow by
definition (21 mil coin cap).  You can also (obviously I guess) add a
homomorphicaly encrypted "0" value to a few other peoples coin balance to
get a kind of taint mitigation.
