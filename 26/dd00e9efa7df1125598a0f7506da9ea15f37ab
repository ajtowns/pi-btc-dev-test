Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.6 worked fine on Tails (and Debian Squeeze, I assume). 
So, it is a regression.

Here's output from the latest nightly build for Linux:

amnesia at amnesia:~/bitcoin-0.9.99.0-20140422-2bbecc8-linux/bin/32$ ./bitcoin-qt
./bitcoin-qt: symbol lookup error: ./bitcoin-qt: undefined symbol: _ZN19QAbstractProxyModel11setItemDataERK11QModelIndexRK4QMapIi8QVariantE

Since Tails has many simple development tools like "make" stripped out 
for security reasons, one could not simply build from source in Tails. 
It might be possible to build in Debian Squeeze and transplant that, 
however. I'll have to give that a shot some time. I'd argue that Tails 
is an incredibly important -- and hardly obscure -- Linux distribution 
that Bitcoin should endeavour to support. See:
