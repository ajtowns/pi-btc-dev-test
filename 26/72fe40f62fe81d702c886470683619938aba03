Vandalize the chain how? By delibrately triggering bugs? (like the old
OP_CHECKSIG abuse problem) Regardless of whether or not the
vulnerability requires multiple blocks in a row, the underlying problem
should be fixed.

By putting illegal data into it? Fundementally we have no way to prevent
people from doing that other than by making it expensive. An attacker
having a lot of hashing power just means they can do so faster and a bit
cheaper.
