Huh? Your examples demonstrate the *opposite* of your point. 'k' and 'M' *are* 
the SI prefixes. People *do* use 63k USD, $63k, and $3M. I'll be the first one 
to admit SI is terrible, but I don't understand your argument here.

P.S. Note that SI units haven't actually ever been adopted, except by force of 
law. "Name me ... that uses SI" is a silly thing to say, since virtually all 
naturally-or-freely-adopted units of any measure have been based on a number 
that factor to twos and threes (not fives, like decimal).
