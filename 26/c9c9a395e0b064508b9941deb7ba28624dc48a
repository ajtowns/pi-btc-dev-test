The problem of fast acting but non vulnerable difficulty adjustment algorithms is interesting. I would certainly like to see this space further explored, and even have some ideas myself.

However without commenting on the technical merits of this specific proposal, I think it must be said upfront that the stated goal is not good. The largest technical concern (ignoring governance) over B2X is that it is a rushed, poorly reviewed hard fork. Hard forks should not be rushed, and they should receive more than the usual level of expert and community review.

I?m that light, doing an even more rushed hard fork on an even newer idea with even less review would be hypocritical at best. I would suggest reframing as a hardfork wishlist research problem for the next properly planned hard fork, if one occurs. You might also find the hardfork research group a more accommodating venue for this discussion:
