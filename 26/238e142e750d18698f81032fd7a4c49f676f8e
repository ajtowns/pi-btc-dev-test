BLE has an advertised range of over 100m.

In the case of mass surveillance that range could most likely be extended dramatically by the reviewer. I've seen  WiFi ranges of over a mile with a strong (not FCC approved) receiver.

WiFi hotspots don't have strong identity or a guaranteed position, so they can't be trusted for location.

Then I guess a BIP would be useful regardless of the design issues. The prefix matching still feels flaky to me but it's hard to know if you could really swipe payments out of the air in practice, without actually trying it.
