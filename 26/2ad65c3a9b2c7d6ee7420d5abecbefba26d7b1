Dear Gavin, Andreas,

I'd see standardisation (or at least suggested standards) for error
handling as positive for consistency of user experience. I do see what
you mean about over-specification, however.

Thanks for the feedback, I've taken the main points and created two pull
requests:

BIP-0070: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/54/
BIP-0072: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/55/

Please tell me if these need any further work.

Ross
