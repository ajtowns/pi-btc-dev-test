I imagine a lot of the things on the contracts page will be implemented by
specialized software that interacts with the Bitcoin network directly.
Transactions would then be moved around, for example, by having clients do
HTTP POSTs of protocol buffers to servers that are listening and know how to
interpret the received messages.
