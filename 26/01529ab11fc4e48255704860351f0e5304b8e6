Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP CPRKV: Check private key verify
Message-ID: <CAE-z3OUpaMLxF9dGttzLUd6tG+nO18FMo3LZqr7taASVmrEumg@mail.gmail.com>

There was some discussion on the bitcointalk forums about using CLTV for
cross chain transfers.

Many altcoins don't support CLTV, so transfers to those coins cannot be
made secure.

I created a protocol.  It uses on cut and choose to allow commitments to
publish private keys, but it is clunky and not entirely secure.

I created a BIP draft for an opcode which would allow outputs to be locked
unless a private key was published that matches a given public key.
