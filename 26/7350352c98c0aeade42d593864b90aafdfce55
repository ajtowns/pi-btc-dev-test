Some changes:

Votes need to be 100%, not 50.01%. That way small miners have a fair
chance. A 50.01% vote means large miners call the shots.

Users (people who make transactions) need to vote. A vote by a miner
shouldn't count without user votes. Fee incentives should attract
legitimate votes from miners. A cheating miner will be defeated by another
miner who includes those votes, and take the fees.

This lets wallet providers and exchanges cast votes (few wallets will
implement prompts and will just auto vote, so if you don't agree, switch
wallets. Vote with your wallet).
