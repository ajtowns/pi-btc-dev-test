As the most active and visible user facing GUI projects (all with some form of URI Scheme), their opinion carries the most weight. To a lesser degree Bitcoin-Qt has the large majority of users too (although that's a line of reasoning I'd discourage).

Note that everytime I have to write Color or Vectorize (as a British speaker) in my code, I die a little inside. But it's convention and American English = International English. Also it would be cool if all code used a *real* international language (like Esperanto) but the world ain't perfect! We live in a decimal-counting English-speaking Windows-using God-worshipping world!

The send crap was not in the original spec, is not implemented anywhere,
and should have been removed as part of the BIP 21 copy/paste.  It is
now gone.

As for the expire time, well thats a bit problematic IMHO.  Technically
BIP 21 is still a draft, but it is implemented in all versions of
Bitcoin-Qt for drag and drop and adding a field which restricts the
validity of a URI for new clients, but which old clients will gladly
accept could result in some ugly situations IMO.
