I'm also highly interested in the case where you sign a delegate
conditional on another delegate being signed, e.g. a bilateral agreement.

In order for this to work nicely you also need internally something like
segwit so that you can refer to one side's delegation by a signature-stable
identity.

I don't have a suggestion of a nice way to do this at this time, but will
stew on it.
