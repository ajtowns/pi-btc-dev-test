This requires the payee operate a server. My use case is for payment to 
individuals, who may or may not have a computer powered at the time of the 
transactions being sent. Furthermore, the users I am targeting (miners, to be 
specific), wish to remain entirely anonymous, and not hold accounts of any 
sort.

This depends on the framework. As of present day, miners are limited to only 
use a single address ever, and cannot change it even to avoid address reuse. 
One goal is to solve that, without breaking multisig.
