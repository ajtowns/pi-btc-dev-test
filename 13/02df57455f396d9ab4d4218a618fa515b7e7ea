Are we designing protocols or applications, its easier and better for all
involved if we design a protocol and then let the applications implement
it.

Lets stick to understanding how labels (dns) or URIs can be leveraged to
securly obtain a bitcoin address, rather than reviewing capabilities of
current applications.
