C'mon people.

Anyone remember when git didn't even exist and all we had was CVS, 
subversion, and BitKeeper?

Get me a couple of motivated grad students who know Python and we can
turn a combination of Mercurial, BitTorrent, and pynode into a distributed,
leaderless, decentralized version control system that can let users 
create a crypto key, anonymously propose BIPs, and then get paid in
crypto for the best commits.

Who else would contribute to a crowdfunding effort to do such at thing?
