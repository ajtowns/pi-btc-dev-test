Yes, of course. An alternative is adding a 21M BTC output at the end, or
bitflipping the txin prevout hashes, or another reversible transformation
on the transaction data that is guaranteed to invalidate it.

I think that the risk of asking people to sign something that is not an
actual transaction, but could be used as one, is very scary.

"Proof of Payment" indeed does make me think it's something that proves you
paid. But as described, that is not what a PoP does. It proves the ability
to create a particular transaction, and committing to it. There is no
actual payment involved (plus, payment makes me think you're talking about
BIP70 payments, not simple Bitcoin transactions).

I don't understand why something like "Proof of Transaction Intent" would
be incompatible with internet over telephone network either...
