Correct. It doesn't prevent value commitment (which is actually what
we need for our currency use), just data storage.

And as Peter points out? you could try to store a little data, but
that has a computational cost which is exponential in the amount of
data stored per output. ... like storing data in values, thats awkward
enough to not be especially problematic, I expect.
