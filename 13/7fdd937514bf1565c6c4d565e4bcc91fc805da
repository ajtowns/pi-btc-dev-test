I looked at the discussions about the block size and about Luke-Jr's
proposal on Reddit and Bitcointalk. From what I observed of all of the
discussions is that few users are in favor of the status quo, and even
fewer are in favor of decreasing the block size. The majority of users
favored Segwit because it was a block size increase (that was a commonly
used reason in support of it and in arguments about increasing the block
size).

Discussions about Luke-Jr's proposal indicated that many users disagreed
with the decrease in block size and the time that it took to increase
again to 1 MB. There was not only disagreement but explicit ridicule and
mocking of that aspect of the proposal.
