It's meant to be in favor of merge mining.

Dogecoin uses scrypt, which is a very popular algorithm. If any large
currency were to be attacked through merge mining, it would probably be
litecoin miners attacking dogecoin. But if you control enough of the
litecoin network to do attack mining against dogecoin, you almost certainly
have a huge vested interest in cryptocurrencies doing well. By attacking
dogecoin successfully, you'll cast doubt on the entire cryptocurrency
ecosystem and hurt yourself in the process.
