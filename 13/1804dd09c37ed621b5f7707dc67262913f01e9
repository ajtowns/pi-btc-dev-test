Really nice! We definitely need to put together a team who really cares
about the operations side of the network and this is a fantastic start.

It'd be nice if you didn't assume knowledge of what statsd is out of the
box. Given the name I'd assumed it was a small UNIX daemon but it seems
it's actually a Javascript thingy?

It looks like putting together a monitored bitcoind setup can be quite a
lot of work. I wonder if there are ways to simplify it. For example, would
it make sense for someone to run a community statsd and graphite instance,
so we can get aggregate statistics across many nodes and the node operators
don't have to set everything up themselves? Does that make any sense?
