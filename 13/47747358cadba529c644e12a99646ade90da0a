A proposal from yesterday would separate this concern; though not
retroactively.  One way to name this proposal would be "Catch-All
Segwit Activation".

  "extended BIP9 activation of segwit, for legacy nodes"

If this release valve exists, then discussions (such as this thread)
can get back to focusing on finding the safest incentive-compatible
