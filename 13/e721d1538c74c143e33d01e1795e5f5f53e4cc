Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bandwidth limits and LN w/ node relay network
	topography
Message-ID: <OlmJBOCNdLgek6x1SvZhs_z04xtkZ1i1zRoJMoeda0WZhMZyRl459BVklFY4xxBmwaP0pLJbBtbUO8i-3bprB8ZuoeoHwUqoHR8rdPYRd9g=@protonmail.com>

Bandwidth limits:
Would be nice to specify global and per node up/down bandwidth limits.
Communicate limits to peers.
Monitor actual bandwidth with peers.
Adjust connections accordingly to attain bandwidth goals/limits.

With Lightning Network:
Prepay for bandwidth/data. Continue paying nodes who continue to send new useful data. Potentially pay different amounts for different kinds of data.
Request refunds when a node sends useless/duplicate/invalid/spam data. Discontinue connection w/ nodes that don't refund. Hence LN payment channel network topography becomes somewhat correlated w/ bitcoin node relay network topography.

Should help nodes get better data faster, improve spam/DDoS resiliance. Incentivizes relay of unconfirmed txs and new blocks, when currently there is only a utilitarian marginal self benefit via helping everyone in general.

Maybe relay advertisements of available bandwidth and prices, etc.

To identify network splits:
Nodes could find hash of "nonce + pub key + tip blockhash" beating a difficulty threshold. Sign, broadcast. Prove their existence and connectedness. History can be maintained and monitored for disruption. Could be made part of the messages that advertise available network bandwidth.

Cheers,
