I would strongly suggest that if you have not done so already you hire
someone competent to do an analysis of whether or not your idea makes
sense at all; that you are using merge-mining is a red-flag because
without majority, or at least near-majority, hashing power an attacker
can 51% attack your altcoin at negligible cost by re-using existing
hashing power. If you are starting a timestamping service that may be an
exception, but how to turn a profit doing so is non-obvious.


I would offer that consulting myself, but it would likely be a conflict
of interest with my employers. I'd be happy to speak informally in
private, but am explicitly unwilling to agree to any
non-compete/non-disclosure terms.
