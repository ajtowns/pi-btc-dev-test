B needs to sell ASICs and buy 90 M tx worth of CPU. 

Or, if you cap blocksize at 10 M tx, than A needs to sell the exact same
amount of CPU and buy the exact same amount of ASICs.

Either way, Miner A ends up with the ASIC cost equivalent of 90 M tx
worth of CPU in additional hashing advantage over B.  The centralization
has nothing to do with block size.  It has to do with Miner A having
more money than Miner B.

Alternatively, you might need to add a few more crazy assumptions.
