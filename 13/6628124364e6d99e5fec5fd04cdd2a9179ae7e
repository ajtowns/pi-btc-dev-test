OK, a few things here:

The Bitcoin network was designed (or should be designed) with the requirement that it can withstand deliberate double-spend attacks that can come from anywhere at any time?and relaxing this assumption without adequately assessing the risk (i.e. I?ve never been hacked before so I can assume it?s safe) is extremely dangerous at best and just horrid security practice at worst. Your users might not thank you for not getting hacked - but they surely will not like it when you DO get hacked?and lack a proper recovery plan.

Furthermore, the protocol itself makes no assumptions regarding the intentions behind someone signing two conflicting transactions. There are many potential use cases where doing so could make a lot of sense. Had the protocol been designed along the lines of, say, tendermint?where signing multiple conflicting blocks results in loss of one?s funds?then the protocol itself disincentivizes the behavior without requiring any sort of altruistic, moralistic assumptions. That would also mean we?d need a different mechanism for the use cases that things like RBF address.

Thirdly, taken to the extreme, the viewpoint of ?signing a conflicting transaction is fraud and vandalism? means that if for whatever reason you attempt to propagate a transaction and nobody mines it for a very long time, you?re not entitled to immediately reclaim those funds?they must remain in limbo forever.
