Incidentally, what's your acceptable revenue difference between a small
(1% hashing power) and large (%30 hashing power) miner, all else being
equal? (remember that we shouldn't preclude variance reduction
techniques such as p2pool and pooled-solo mode)

Equally, what kind of attacks on miners do you think we need to be able to
resist? E.g. DoS attacks, hacking, etc.

That would let me know if you're definition of "the brakes are bad"
corresponds to normal usage, or something that's not reasonable to
design for.
