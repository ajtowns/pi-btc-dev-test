I'm also strongly in favor of moving forward with this plan.

A couple of points:
1) There has been too much confusion in looking at segwit as an alternative
way to increase the block size and I think that is incorrect.  It should
not be drawn into the block size debate as it brings many needed
improvements and tools we'd want even if no one were worried about block
size now.
2) The full capacity increase plan Greg lays out makes it clear that we can
accomplish a tremendous amount without a contentious hard fork at this
point.
3) Let's stop arguing endlessly and actually do work that will benefit
everyone.
