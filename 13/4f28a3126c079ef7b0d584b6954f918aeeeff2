Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Version 0.6 release candidate 1 plan
Message-ID: <CABsx9T0-eMkfJiOL_2VN5TUuvs_fYANa3XXoM5OX4AMP1W2iSA@mail.gmail.com>

There are several major changes in git HEAD that are ready for wider
testing. The best way of getting lots of testing is to release
binaries, so I'm going to be pulling together a release candidate in
the next day or two.

The goal will be to get at least a full month of release candidate
review/testing before releasing a 0.6 final, with zero High Priority
bugs ( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?labels=Priority+High&state=open
)

Here's the proposed TODO list for a rc1:

Pull:
800 : bug fix, multiple output display fix in GUI
799 : Have bitcoind recomend a secure RPC password
769 : Make transactions with extra data in scriptSig non-standard

Rebase/pull:
795 : Fix minimize to tray

Pull a modified version of:
755 : Don't vote for /P2SH/ unless -p2sh specified

I'd like to pull 787 (CAddrMan: stochastic address manager) but it
didn't pass my sanity tests.

I'm going to start a separate discussion thread with some thoughts on
rolling out higher-level multisignature support.
