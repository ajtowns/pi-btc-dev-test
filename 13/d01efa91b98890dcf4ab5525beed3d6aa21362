Old nodes running bitcoind will see it as OP_NOP2, and will reject it
unless they've manually disabled SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS,
which (aiui) has been available since bitcoin 0.10 [0], but not backported
to 0.8 or 0.9.

That covers about 4700/5880 nodes going by bitnodes.21.co; but I can't
tell how many miners it covers.

Further, AIUI, nodes running 0.8 or 0.9 will still apply IsStandard()
checks to scripts attempting to spend p2sh outputs [1], so will also
fail to either mine or relay your OP_NOP2 payment.

My understanding is that this isn't supposed to be a problem because you
won't be able to find an old miner that will do that; released versions
of bitcoin already block it by default.

Sure, someone could disable those checks and not pay attention to a soft
fork that will cause their blocks to be orphaned, but I'm not seeing why
that's any different a threat compared to someone deliberately mining
invalid blocks to do 1-confirmation doublespends against merchants not
running a full node.

At least, that's my understanding, and I'm not an expert, so corrections
appreciated.

Cheers,
