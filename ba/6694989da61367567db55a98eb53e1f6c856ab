You should tell AT&T that you want the DVR/cable box put into what is
usually referred to as "bridge mode" or sometimes "true bridge mode"
depending on your ISP and then use your own router, look under
"Bridged Mode" at the bottom of this page for AT&T
http://www.att.com/gen/general?pid=23697 . You want your own router to
have the external IP, if it does not it is not configured correctly.
In general one should never use a router provided by their ISP for
anything other than modem functionality since it is typically only the
ISP that can change the firmware on it, it also makes troubleshooting
problems like this more difficult.
