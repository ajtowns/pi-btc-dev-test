Satoshi didn't create testnet.  Testnet exists so you can do public
tests involving multiple people and services, so you can have shadow
versions of sites and services interacting with each other and trading
worthless tokens. Importantly, testnet also creates a public live fire
environment where grey hats can try out their attacks while minimizing
damage (and it's been very successful at this).  Testnet is not an
alternative to the unit and integration tests that exist in Bitcoin
core but exists for more or less completely different reasons.

Testnet is not normally addressed in BIPs at all, except for soft fork
bips that had compressed deployment schedules on testnet.  For address
like specification we have always used a version byte and there is a
common encoding for version bytes that flags the network ID in the
byte.
