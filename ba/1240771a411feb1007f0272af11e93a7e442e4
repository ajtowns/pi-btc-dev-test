I think the ship of hand-wavy, data-free logic sailed with 
'money supply == 21 million', so why not enjoy the ride? If we care about
real people and real use cases, then let's talk about indexing the money 
supply to some blockchain-observable value and add demurrage instead of 
of bikeshedding the color of the latest coat of paint.

I'm surprised every time I pull up to a gas pump and the price is 3.249999
per gallon. But I don't really care what the price is, as long as there's 
an e85 pump. If I could pay at the pump with bitcoin, I wouldn't even look
at the price, I'd only care if my tank got filled up or if I have to drive
slower to get better mileage.

Hell, I'd have an app that would tell me what gas station to go to that got
me the best miles per bitcoin based on where I actually wanted to go.
