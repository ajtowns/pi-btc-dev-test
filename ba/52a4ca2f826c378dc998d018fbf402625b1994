How do I document in the embedded consensus system what the ruling in
a small-claims court about the ownership of a contested asset was?

Good accounting systems (such as mercurial, and proper double-entry 
financial accounting tools) allow reverting a bad commit, or bad data
entry, while maintaining records of the history. Not as good accounting
systems (like git) allow you to re-write history. What's the equivalent
user interface, process, and wire protocol for reversing a fraudulent
transaction while maintaining a full audit trail?

Courts can't legislate our code, and we can't expect them to download
and trust our 'distributed de-centralized' digital asset tracking system
that will be downloaded from a single centralized developer website
unless we meet them at least halfway, and probably need to propose model
municipal and county ordinances that go along with our code releases.

I would agree 100% that we need to build them, test the code, use them,
and then *try them in court*, and make sure we can explain in very simple
plain language what an 'embedded consensus system' is to the distributed 
de-centralized local court systems.
