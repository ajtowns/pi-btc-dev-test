I agree
There are a lot of difficult technical problems introduced by insufficient block space that are best addressed now.  As well as problems that scale will exacerbate like bootstrapping that we should develop solutions for first.

When we run out of space and the block size is low, we will see problems.  If we raise the block size, we will NOT see these problems until bitcoin is bigger and more important and the pressure is higher.

It is a problem for those who don't wait for even one confirmation, but backlogs in the past have already started training users to wait for at least one confirmation, or go off-chain.  I am comfortable leaving those zero-conf people in a little bit of trouble.  Everyone else can double-spend (perhaps that's not as easy as it should be in bitcoin core) and use a higher fee, thus competing for block space.  Yes, $5 transactions suck, but $0.15 is not so bad and about twice the average right now.

My favorite thing to do is to have a solution ready for a problem I expect to see, see the problem (so I can measure things about it) and then implement the solution.

I think that has been improved with headers-first, but many people don't know it.

It involves bonded representation of important not-so-large pieces of data (blocks that have my transactions, the complete UTXO as of some height, etc.).  If I know that I have some btc, I could offer it (say, 100 or 1000 transaction fees' worth) to anyone who will guarantee good data to me, and then when I have the whole blockchain, I will know if they were honest.  If done right, the whole network could know whether or not they were honest and enforce the bond if they weren't.  Credit the Lightening paper for parts of this idea.
