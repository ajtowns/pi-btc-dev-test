Interesting. I didn't think about this before, but it seems like bip125 is rather incentive incompatible right now? If we're assuming a competitive mempool, it really doesn't seem generally rational to accept a replacement transaction of a lower fee rate.

So how about if we change the fee requirement to bet at least:

MIN(
         $ORIGINAL_FEE_RATE * $REPLACEMENT_TX_SIZE + $RELAY_FEE * ( REPLACEMENT_TX_SIZE + $ORIGINAL_SIZE),
        $ORIGINAL_ABS_FEE  / 3
)  in fees

This could make it:
* More incentive compatible
* Support more use-cases (my transaction merging example)
* Be resistant to any attacks (that I can see, there's no doubt cases I haven't thought about)

In fact, right now it's quite possible to do -- but because of the "higher absolute fee" rule the benefits are pretty muted (although if you can compress 2 change into 1, that's still likely worthwhile)

Let's say that I owe John 1 bitcoin, and have promised to pay him immediately: Instead of creating a whole new transaction if I have an in-flight (unconfirmed) transaction, I can follow the rules of bip125 to create a replacement that accomplishes this goal.
