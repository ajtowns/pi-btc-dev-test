Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Password-protected private key export format
	and version bytes
Message-ID: <4E454C66.4010706@gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I've been working on a new private key export format that includes
simple password-protection.  Details of the scheme are posted at:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=36195.0

It is intended as an interchange format, not specifically integrated
with wallet encryption, and simple enough to be produced by the
vanitygen program.  Importing to the official bitcoin client using a
method like the import/export patch would require the user to provide
the password of the private key, in addition to the wallet password if
the wallet is encrypted.

Comments on the format are welcomed!

As the proposed format is base-58, I would like to make a request to use
one of the data classes as proposed by Pieter Wuille about a month ago:

http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=20110708092506.GA6641%40ulyssis.org&forum_name=bitcoin-development

If this doesn't fit with the general bitcoin development agenda, that's
OK too, but I would like to explore some possibility for a protected
export format for private keys.

Thanks,
-Sam Revitch
