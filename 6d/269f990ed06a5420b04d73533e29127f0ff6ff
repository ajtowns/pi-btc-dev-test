So you are essentially imagining that a perpetrator will combine the
crypto-nerd fantasy (brute forcing the passphrase) *with* the 5-dollar
wrench attack, merging both panes of Randall Munroe's comic? Seems
vanishingly unlikely to me - attackers are generally either the wrench
type, or the crypto-nerd type.

This thread started by you asking Pavol to give an example of a real-life
scenario in which this functionality would be used, and your rebuttal is a
scenario that is even less likely to occur. "Very dangerous" is a huge
stretch.

When living in Brazil I often carried two (IRL) wallets - one a decoy to
give to muggers, the other with more value stored in it. I heard of plenty
of people getting mugged, but I never heard of anyone who gave a decoy
wallet getting more thoroughly searched and the second wallet found,
despite the relative ease with which a mugger could do this. I'm sure it
has happened, probably many times, but point is there is rarely time for
contemplation in a shakedown, and most perpetrators will take things at
face value and be satisfied with getting something. And searching a
physical person's body is a hell of a lot simpler than cracking a
passphrase.

Moreover, there's no limit to the number of passphrases you can use. If you
were an atttacker, at what point would you stop, satisfied? After the
first, second, third, fourth wallet that you find/they admit to owning?
Going beyond two is already Bond-supervillain level implausible.
