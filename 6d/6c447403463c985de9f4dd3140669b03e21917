I understand now why someone thought I was fishing.  That link should 
work just fine...I'm not sure what the problem is as I know I forked 
correctly.  I guess I'll need to register a domain for it an get a page 
going and link from there.  I just haven't gotten around to it but will 
do that.  I'll get going!  Just know that I would never set up fishing; 
that's not my style.
