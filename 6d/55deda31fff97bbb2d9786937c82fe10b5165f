It wouldn't be less secure as long as you adjust the confirmation
accordingly. If we decided to mine one block every minute, then your
usual 6 confirmation should become 60 confirmation. In the end, the same
amount of work will have been done to prove the transaction is legit and
so it's just as secure... Actually, one could argue since the average
hash rate over 60 block is more accurate than over 6, it's actually more
secure if you also pay attention to hash rate variation as part of the
confirmation... That help in the scenario a very large pool goes dark to
mine a sidechain.
