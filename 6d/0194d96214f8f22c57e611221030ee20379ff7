Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Reconsider build system change?
Message-ID: <CAJNQ0stvozeQAVFkduY7Ph5EXy8ayYwiu4T+6Oz1RwjgiDnBeA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Why again did we choose for autotools as future build system instead of
cmake?

- CMake generates native build scripts for Make (all platforms), XCode,
Visual Studio. Autoconf only does Make.

- CMake has a clearer syntax, m4/autotools is very convoluted

- CMake is very fast

- CMake is supported natively in Qt Creator in the QT SDK, and is used by
many other KDE/QT as well as other open source applications. Many people
discourage the use of autotools for new projects.

A CMake build system for bitcoin is already integrated into rpcminer,
available here:
