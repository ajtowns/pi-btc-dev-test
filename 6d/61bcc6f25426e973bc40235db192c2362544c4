I'm getting an intermittent crashes on bitcoin-qt.exe when doing RPC 
commands. I seem to be able to get it to occur most frequently when I 
send a bunch of RPC commands in rapid succession. I have never 
encountered it with "getbalance", but I have with some other commands. 
Sending a single letter as the command seems to trigger the crash most 
often.

I was unable to generate the crash using 0.4.1.

I was unable to find an issue logged for this, although I wonder if it 
is related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/639

Can anyone make suggestion on any other debug information I can gather 
before submitting an issue?
