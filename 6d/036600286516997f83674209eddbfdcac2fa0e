Indeed, and with things like BIP32 it would be pointless to use one address, and I agree it is silly to reuse addresses, some for the privacy aspect, some for the revealing the pubkey on a spend aspect. But just because it is silly, doesn't mean it's necessarily required for devs to disallow it. I mean if a business doesn't care who can see their  bitcoin takings and they are willing to keep shifting the bitcoin and live woth the exposed pubkey let them yea?

I hope you're mistaken, because that would be a serious attack on the
design of bitcoin, which obtains privacy and fungibility, both
essential properties of any money like good, almost exclusively
through avoiding reuse.

[What business would use a money where all their competition can see
their sales and identify their customers, where their customers can
track their margins and suppliers? What individuals would use a system
where their inlaws could criticize their spending? Where their
landlord knows they got a raise, or where thieves know their net
worth?]

Though no one here is currently suggesting blocking reuse as a network
rule, the reasonable and expected response to what you're suggesting
would be to do so.

If some community wishes to choose not to use Bitcoin, great, but they
don't get to simply choose to screw up its utility for all the other
users.

You should advise this "country specific bitcoin group" that they
shouldn't speak for the users of a system which they clearly do not
understand.
