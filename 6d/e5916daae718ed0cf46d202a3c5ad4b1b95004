Ok, that would be an option.

The memo field (and its logical evolution, an invoice) also needs to be
verified, since its part of the contract. Imagine sitting in a
restaurant and you're being presented the bill, most people will do a
quick scan of the meals and drinks consumed (and non-malignant errors
are frequent in that business).

Everything except Beam bypasses Beam (-:  Beam is an Android-specific
protocol. I assume it would also be possible to write an own NDEF
implementation on top of the low level NFC APIs. I want to try as soon
as I have a second NFC-capable phone, preferably Android 4.4.

You can't really blame the subway for a broken payment process.

Yes, it was a complete disaster. Obtaining a ticket took even longer --
ca. 45 minutes. Boarding the train took some additional seconds,
compared to no overhead in Germany where we simply don't have any gates.

On top of that, you walk more (in tunnels) than you get driven around,
get tracked on each movement and if you want to get your (monetary)
change, you need to wait for another 45 minutes.

The upside is, when going by public transport in England I always feel
like Mr. Freeman in City 17  (-:
