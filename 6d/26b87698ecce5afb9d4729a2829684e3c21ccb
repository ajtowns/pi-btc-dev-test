"key id" (thanks sipa).

I know it's a more technical term, but that is rather the point. It
was a fundamental error to call hashed-pubkeys "addresses" as people
either associate this with "account" or physical addresses, which also
rarely change.

Security and privacy guarantees of the system are defeated when key
pairs are reused. We should ideally adopt terminology that lead people
to associations of ephemeral, temporary use. "key id" is at least
neutral in this regard. Can anyone think of something better?
