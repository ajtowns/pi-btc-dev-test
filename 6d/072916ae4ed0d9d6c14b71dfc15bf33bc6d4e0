I have updated the
spec<https://github.com/Flavien/colored-coins-protocol/blob/master/specification.mediawiki>
.

significant problem for some kinds of applications.

This is correct, the number of colored outputs you can have per transaction
is limited by OP_RETURN's 40 bytes. We use a compact format
(LEB128<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128>)
for the asset quantity of each output to mitigate that. Assuming you're
transferring small amounts of colored coins, you could have up to about 30
colored ouputs.

It should work for a decentralized exchange (you only really need 2 or 3
colored outputs). Applications like sending dividends in colored coins
however may require splitting into several smaller transactions, but I
believe that's an acceptable limitation.
