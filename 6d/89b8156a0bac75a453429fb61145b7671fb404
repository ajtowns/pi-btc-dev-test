Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 21 (modification BIP 20)

Generally I prefer BIP 21 over BIP 20.

I'm neutral on the 'send' parameter - present in both BIPs - which I
don't understand. I think a practical usecase should be given in the BIP.

Also, the 'version' parameter is unclear. What does it mean? Is an oder
defined on versions (1.0b > 1.0)? Why is it an ";" parameter rather than
a normal "&" parameter?
