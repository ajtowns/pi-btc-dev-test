I think it's more an issue of accidental breakage than any maliciousness. One character in the wrong place in a language bundle somewhere can make the difference between success and runtime failure, and it may not be immediately apparent when running in unaffected locales. This kind of problem isn't likely to result in data loss (or money loss, where money is data, is in Bitcoin), but it could be enough to necessitate scrapping the whole release, which would look bad and prompt users to question the dev team's quality control process.
