Subject: [bitcoin-dev] A BIP proposal for conveniently referring to
	confirmed transactions
Message-ID: <jdM3MNvhFZPKmb5fGRhp7jvuZnOpa9vUsaOxnKBH4EiX8Gz8yeZuJZRbqYfW_YiRM6G0vdcXTbPd_q_2jwJ0OepZLahKSmX-e2XhGdviIKM=@protonmail.com>

Hello List,

I would like to propose a BIP that specifies a way of referring to transactions that have been successfully inserted into the blockchain.

The format makes use of the excellent Bech32 encoding, and is designed to be short and useful for human use. A C reference implementation is included.

Special care has been taken so this BIP is naturally extendable to support future upgrades to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Sidechains, or even from other blockchain projects. However, only support for the Bitcoin Main Chain, and the Test Network is specified in this draft.

I hope that the participants of the bitcoin-development mailing list find this draft BIP both interesting and useful. You are welcomed to read the full text here: https://github.com/veleslavs/bips/blob/Bech32_Encoded_TxRef/bip-XXXX-Bech32_Encoded_Transaction_Postion_References.mediawiki

If assigned with a BIP number some small updates to the specification will be made in accommodation.

? ?????????? ???????????,
