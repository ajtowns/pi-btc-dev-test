Subject: [bitcoin-dev] New Soft Fork Deployment: CSV (BIP's 68, 112, 113)
Message-ID: <CAPWm=eWhwphyex=m51KGjQmzoP3Yedt6_+As1o9wEr-A-+X+Sg@mail.gmail.com>

Following on my earlier message
<https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-March/012485.html>,
I am happy to announce a new soft fork to be deployed using BIP 9
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki> - Version
bits.

Please review BIP 9
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki> as it has
been updated for information on how Version bits soft forks activate.

This deployment is being referred to as CSV (CheckSequenceVerify) and will
activate the following 3 BIPS as consensus rules:
BIP 68 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki> -
Relative lock-time using consensus-enforced sequence numbers
BIP 112 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki> -
CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
BIP 113 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki> -
Median time-past as endpoint for lock-time calculations

These BIP's have been updated with the deployment information:
bit: 0
startTime: 1462060800 "May 1st, 2016"   (mainnet)
           1456790400 "March 1st, 2016" (testnet)
endTime:   1493596800 "May 1st, 2017"   (mainnet and testnet)


Bitcoin Core will release 0.11.3 and 0.12.1 software which implements these
soft forks in the near future.


Thanks,
Alex
