Let's pretend it is late 2012.

Nobody has ever violated the soft limit of 500KB/block.
Block reward is about to be cut in half.
Fees are right where they are today.
1 BTC = about $15.

It's a good thing nothing was done in 2012 to try to boost fees out of
concern for miner profits.

Nor should we today.  The 16X rise in the economic value? of the block
reward since that time covers the entire .5X effect of the halving
itself, plus three additional halvings.  There is far less reason today
to worry on miners' behalf about fees than there was in late 2012.

Running out of ways to grow does threaten miner profit, and therefore
security, growth.  So let's hope all the scaling ideas work.

These soft limits serve no purpose, other than to delay transactions.  A
750KB block is followed by another 750KB or larger block just as
frequently as you would expect from the actual block time distribution,
which recently (prior to spam now underway) had a rate of a full 1MB
block being needed every 104 minutes (in an earlier post I gave a
relation which is very stable, given the stable average transaction size).
