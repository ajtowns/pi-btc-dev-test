I too would prefer that, but I do not believe there exists a method for computing a traditional signature from decomposed private key shares. Unless I'm mistaken, the composed signature has a different formula and requires a different verification algorithm from the ECDSA signatures we're using today. Thus, such a scheme would require a change to the Bitcoin scripting language. I specifically did not want to address that in my BIP because changes like that take too long. I am aiming to be useful in the present.
