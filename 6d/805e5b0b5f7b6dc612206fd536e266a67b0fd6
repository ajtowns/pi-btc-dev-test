That's simply not how the rest of the community perceives bips, and until we
move them elsewhere that's not going to change.

No matter how much we scream that we don't have authority, the fact of the
matter is the bips are located under the github.com/bitcoin namespace, and we
do have editorial control over them.

Right, so you accept that we'll exert some degree of editorial control; the
question now is what editorial policies should we exert?

My argument is that rejecting BIP75 is something we should do on
ethical/strategic grounds. You may disagree with that, but please don't troll
and call that "advocating censorship"
