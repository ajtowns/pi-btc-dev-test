Hi Breno,

There has been discussion on various ways to improve multilingual usage of
BIP39. https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/
2018-January/015500.html

My takeaway is that we should be implementing a standard way to convert any
words into a hex string, regardless of language or character encoding. In
that discussion there was some notion of "who needs anything but English
words anyway?" rhetoric, so I'm happy to see yet again that there exists an
obvious need to support all languages for a standard in wallet seed
generation.

I realise that doesn't help you today considering there is no such
multilingual standard or official Portuguese wordlist, but I wanted to
express that this is an ongoing topic of discussion and it's clear we need
to start choosing/codifying a standard in this regard.

That said, here's somebody who has started a Portuguese wordlist so maybe
you can start from there.
