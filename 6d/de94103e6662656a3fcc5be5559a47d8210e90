This is true, but it cannot make us accept any invalid filters unless the
attacker is also creating invalid blocks w/ valid PoW.

Indeed, but no such proposal for committing the filters has emerged yet.
Slinging filters with new p2p messages requires much less coordination that
adding a new committed structure to Bitcoin. One could imagine that if
consensus exists to add new committed structures, then there may also be
initiatives to start to commit sig-ops, block weight, utxo's etc. As a
result one could imagine a much longer deployment cycle compared to a pure
p2p roll out in the near term, and many applications are looking for a
viable alternative to BIP 37.

I agree that using the prev input scripts would indeed be optimal from a
size perspective when the filters are to be committed. The current proposal
makes way for future filter types and it's likely the case that only the
most optimal filters should be committed (while other more niche filters
perhaps, remain only on the p2p level).
