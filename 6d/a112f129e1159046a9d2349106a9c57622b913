Why not combine these two?

Need to specify the format of how these arrive. It means that when a
new block is found instead of inv<->getdata<->block we'd see something
like  inv<->getdata<->merkleblock where a "merkleblock" structure is a
header + list of transactions + list of merkle branches linking them
to the root. I think CMerkleTx already knows how to serialize this,
but it redundantly includes the block hash which would not be
necessary for a merkleblock message.
