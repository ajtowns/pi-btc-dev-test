I think eventually multi-wallet support will make it so that a wallet
won't be created by default. Instead users would create-wallet, which
would also give them options like using a HSM (e.g. trezor) or
multisig secured wallet.  That would be a great point where, if they
elect to run and ordinary unsecured wallet, and the software detects
that the host is known-to-not-likely-be-secure it could whine at them
and direct them to a security best practices page.

Then you also avoid whining at people who never run a wallet or use a
hsm making the host security somewhat moot.
