I'm trying to think through how to encourage the maximum number of instant
signature providers and avoid the VISA monopoly. Ideal case would be that
people can even be their own instant provider.

What if the protocol allowed multiple instant signatures on a transaction?
Would it encourage more instant providers? For example, a new instant
provider could bootstrap their own trust by paying an already trusted
instant provider to co-sign the same transaction. This would be useful in
the case that a new company tries to release a new wallet once the trust
ring is already established. Nobody will use that wallet because it does
not have the trusted history to do instant transactions, but if they can
pay a small amount per transaction to a third party to cosign, they can
build trust in their own signature till they can eventually have enough
trust on their own. This could be how an individual user could grow trust
in their own instant signature as well.
