The point of this is it's available right now. It's not ideal, but it will
work. It doesn't require any code and we can do it today.

In case you haven't been paying attention; there's already enough support
for Unlimited to prevent SegWit from ever being adopted. Without
significant community outreach (which is the purpose of the CCVS) and a
compelling solution to max block size, Core as a product is dead.

Also, you need to be pretty paranoid to believe that address reuse is an
issue in this situation.

Note also that the BIP process already has BIP Comments for leaving textual

This does nothing for the community in general. Plus there's no way to
measure that sort of feedback.
