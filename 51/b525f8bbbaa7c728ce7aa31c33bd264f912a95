Keeping the block size at 1mb restricts the number of active users of bitcoin to around 100,000 people transacting twice a day on blockchain.  

BItcoin is a protocol.  Protocols are successful because of their network effect.  Capping the block size freezes bitcoin?s network effect, limits users and prevents new users from joining (which will cut demand to exchange bitcoin) and also freeze the economic incentive to mine, because it will hurt the price.  

Keeping the 1MB cap in place is horrible for the health of bitcoin.  It?s good for competing protocols that want a chance to ?catch up?. 

Freezing bitcoin?s growth for any meaningful length of time will threaten its position as the leading cryptocurrency.  Reasonable, controlled growth is a good thing.  BIP101 should be rolled into core as soon as feasible.
