its an always offline node, so it knows nothing really other than a
BIP 32 hierarchy of keys & a signature request.

So the signature request has to drag with it information to validate
what the value is, in order to be sure not to sign away 99% to fees.
Signing the transaction value and having the network validate that the
value in the sig matches full nodes view of the tx value avoids that
issue.  Simple, elegant, but... we have no live beta mechanism, and
hence risk & testing makes that tricky.  Plus the full network upgrade
issue if its not backwards compatible.
