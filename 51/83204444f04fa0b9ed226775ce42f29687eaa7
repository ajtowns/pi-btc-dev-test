Yes, the idea is to handle the problem in the library so that app
developers don't have to handle the case of missing addresses or just
ignore the problem.  It also doesn't add much complexity to the library
as the current implementations already test for invalid keys.  The
library would then just retry instead of returning an error (that most
app developers would then ignore).
