I was looking at this site recently and it's not very clear that by
clicking the name you get their opinion. I would make that a separate
column stated, Technical Opinion.

I think you need to include more of the developers/technical people,
Adam Back, Mark Friedenback, Jorge Timons, (all of who are core
developers). You need
Peter Todd is a core dev btw, as is thebluematt.

You need other experts, I would include Nick Szabo, Meni Rosenfeld,
Charlie Lee might be a good one. You should get the pools on there
too.

You're missing Mike Hearn of course.
