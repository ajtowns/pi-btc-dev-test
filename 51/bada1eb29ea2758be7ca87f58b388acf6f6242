Look at feefilter BIP 133
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0133.mediawiki#backward-compatibility)
or sendheaders BIP130
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki#backward-compatibility)
Isn't it the same there?
Once BIP151 is implemented, it would make sense to bump the protocol
version, but this needs to be done once this has been
implemented/deployed. Or do I make a mistake somewhere?

How do you threat any other not known message types? Any peer can send
you any type of message anytime. Why would your implementation how you
threat unknown messages be different for messages specified in BIP151?
