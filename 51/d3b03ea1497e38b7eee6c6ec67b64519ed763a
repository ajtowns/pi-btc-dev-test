Thanks Johnson and Hampus for the clarifications.
However, I would rather do the opposite: soft-fork to 50% now, and
soft-fork again to 75% discount later if needed, because it doesn't affect
the max transactions/second.

Segwit as it is today should be activated. However if it is not before
November, then for the next Segwit attempt I would choose a more
conservative 50% discount.
