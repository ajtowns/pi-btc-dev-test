I for one would be interested in taking a look at that.

In San Jose I was asking around about the possibility of hiring someone to complete such a patch. Pieter Wuille introduced me to Eric Lombrozo, who expressed interest, but has since gotten quite busy. So we haven't arrived at a detailed estimate of what it would involve.

Maybe it would be better to start a completely new thread for this topic, but I would very much be interested in an open dissection of what adding SPV support to bitcoind would take. I am willing to fund or (ideally) co-fund this endeavor, if I can ever get my head around it. I'm super interested in all of these possibilities (including micro-stripped-VMs and transpilation), but would simply like to encourage the proliferation of _options_ whenever possible.
