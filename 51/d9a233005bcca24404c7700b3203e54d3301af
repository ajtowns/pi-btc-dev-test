I don't know what criticism it was, but I feel that another BIP than
BIP44 should be created to describe which HD paths should be used for ECIES.

That looks great! I already implemented Electrum's way of ECIES into
TREZOR firmware, but yours version seems much more complete, so I am
inclined to throw it away and use your implementation.

Have you thought about pushing this as a new BIP (different one than I
mention above)? I think it's important to have it reviewed and
standardized ASAP.
