any device.
> An ad-sign where you pay in advance for e.g. 2-weeks exclusivity. During
this period you can upload new content to the sign whenever you like using
PoP.

of the T-shirt is selected among the transactions to that address. You
exchange the T-shirt for a PoP for the winning transaction.

Anonymous Credentials allows an issuer to declare that you have certain
rights. For example, upon paying the service provider could issue you the
credentials for using their service up until a certain date.

When challenged to prove a statement about what credentials you have, you
can prove the fact that you've got the right credentials without revealing
anything else. You don't even reveal you're the same person as the last
time, if you prove the right to access a VPN multiple times there's no data
in it that links the different sessions together.

The main difference is that issuance of Anonymous Credentials aren't
"atomic" with the payment transactions, which can open up the risk for
certain types of dishonest behavior by the seller. You could however use a
proof in court of having paid for the credentials but not getting them
issued to you (maybe throw in usage of Factom to log issuance of
credentials?). With this construction of using both these methods, you add
stronger privacy for the usage of the services while simultaneously keeping
a degree of accountability for the payment.

The Zerocoin developers also got a paper on a blockchain version,
"Distributed Anonymous Credentials".
