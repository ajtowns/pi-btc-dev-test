Block headers are so small - 80 bytes - that it may be reasonable to just stop using the inv mechanism for them in favor of always sending headers. IIRC a inv is 32 bytes of digest and another four bytes or something of the inv string itself - that's already nearly half of the header.

Meanwhile reducing the amount of state in the protocol does have some value, and decreasing overall latency for headers to get around the network certainely isnt a bad thing.
