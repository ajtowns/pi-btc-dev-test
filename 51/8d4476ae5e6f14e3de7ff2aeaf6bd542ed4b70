If Bitcoin is managed with a linux kernel style dictator it would be 
centralized (yet unlike linux, where people can fork without impacting others 
in Bitcoin a hard fork puts at risks everyone's bitcoins) - I hope we all 
agree there is no point in a centralized Bitcoin?

In addition and more importantly, it would put Gavin in tremendous dangers, 
both from violent threats/blackmailing prospective as well as regulatory 
prospective - how can you not see that?

I hope all this confrontation will be worth something in the end: to show 
that Bitcoin can't be changed centrally and that it can't be changed without 
consensus
