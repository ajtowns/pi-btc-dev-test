Is 49 days particularly useful? Would it be a problem to instead leave both-
bits undefined? I'm thinking this might be better as a way to indicate "7 
days, plus a deterministically chosen set of historical blocks"...

This is technically true right now, but as soon as segwit activates, it will 
no longer be... Therefore, I suggest striking it from the BIP, expounding on 
it in greater detail, or making it true for the longer term.

This isn't entirely clear whether it refers to peers downloading blocks, or 
peers serving them. (I assume the former, but it should be clarified.)

Wouldn't this already be a problem, without the BIP?
