And this is precisely why we should make perfectly clear that we're
not against a code fork where Hearn or anyone else acts as a
"benevolent dictator", just against the controversial hardfork it is
attempting to deploy.
Otherwise the PR battle is probably lost (which may mean users sell
all their BTC for XTBTC [or just forget about their BTC and only care
about their XTBTC]).
