Subject: [bitcoin-dev] The Excessive-Block Gate: How a Bitcoin Unlimited
	Node Deals With Large Blocks
Message-ID: <C10BF9D1-435D-47C9-B98C-9B118B5922A1@gmx.com>

Dear all,

Bitcoin Unlimited?s market-based solution to the block-size limit is slowly winning support from node operators and miners.  With this increased attention, many people are asking for a better explanation of how Bitcoin Unlimited actually works.  The article linked below describes how Bitcoin Unlimited?s excessive-block logic works from the perspective of a single node. (I?m hoping to do a follow-up article that describe how this ?node-scale? behavior facilitates the emergence of a fluid and organic block size limit at the network scale.)
