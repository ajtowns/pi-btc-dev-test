Two answers:

1. If you are willing to wait an infinite amount of time, I think the
minimum fee will always be zero or very close to zero, so I think it's a
silly question.

2. The "market minimum fee" should be determined by the market. It should
not be up to us to decide "when is a good time."

Sure, if keeping up with transaction volume requires a cluster of computers
or more than "pretty good" broadband bandwidth I think that's too far.
That's where original 20MB limit comes from, otherwise I'd have proposed a
much higher limit.

Although I've been very clear with my criterion, no, I don't think all
blocksize increase proposals should have to justify "why this size" or "why
this rate of increase." Part of my frustration with this whole debate is
we're talking about a sanity-check upper-limit; as long as it doesn't open
up some terrible new DoS possibility I don't think it really matters much
what the exact number is.

It prevents trivial denial-of-service attacks (e.g. I promise to send you a
1 Terabyte block, then fill up your memory or disk...).

And please read what I wrote: I said that the block limit has LITTLE effect
on MINING centralization.  Not "no effect on any type of centralization."

If the limit was removed entirely, it is certainly possible we'd end up
with very few organizations (and perhaps zero individuals) running full
nodes.
