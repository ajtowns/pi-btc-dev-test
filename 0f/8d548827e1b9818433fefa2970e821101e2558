We have this awesome technology that solves the double-spending
problem. It's called a blockchain. Of course, it only works when
transactions are actually in a block.

This issue is about double-spending preventing before they're
confirmed. This is (and has always been) just a best-effort mechanism
in the network.

That is what is being proposed here, by introducing a mechanism where
miners can vote to penalize other miners if they seem to allow (too
many?) double spends.

Not very relevant.
