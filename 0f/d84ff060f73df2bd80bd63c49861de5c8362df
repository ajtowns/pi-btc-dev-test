I agree, I definitely want to go about this in a non-jerk way. I would
be pissed if I spent hours coding something, and it was put on the
back burner and eventually closed (especially without notice). The
wording and process could use refinement.

I can definitely do this, and give a wordy notice before I start the
timer. I will write up a message that links to a rebase walkthrough
(any suggestions? I think Gavin has one somewhere...), I would like it
to be more detailed than GitHub's walk-through.

My main reason for pushing this is that it will help clear out some of
the older pulls/issues that exist right now. I'm hoping that in the
future, the QA process will be good enough that pulls/issues won't
fall behind from lack of testing - and the timers will be used very
sparingly. It should only be in place to sort out the pulls/issues
that the majority doesn't want included in the client.
