Unfortunately not: miners have in the past routinely gamed the timestamp in
order to use it as an extra nonce and squeeze some more gigahashes out of
their hardware/pool.

Also remember that currently the chain could be dominated by a coalition of
just two pools.

The app cannot tell if it was given a truncated chain. You could keep such
an app stuck in the past forever. This is often a problem.

Much though I hate to be a party pooper, you could currently get
Bitcoin-level trusted time by just polling at least two or three
independent servers e.g. google.com, baidu.cn, yandex.ru    (they all serve
time via HTTPS headers).

If we crack the mining decentralisation problem then this argument becomes
a lot stronger, but for now ......

If you have a tamper resistant execution environment (TXT, SGX, Flicker
etc) then yes. However trusted execution environments sometimes have tamper
resistant clocks as well for exactly this reason. So whether this technique
makes sense depends a lot on the details of your configuration, I think.
