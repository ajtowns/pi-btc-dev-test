Yes, I had noted this (see link below).

(Just to note (see link below) what I'm sure you're aware of but a
reader might forget: if the change output that the sender provided is
larger than the payment amount, the above won't happen).

Really good point, and I think your argument is reasonable, if not
watertight. (Just in case you missed it I tried to outline an algo to
let the receiver avoid UIH2 on best effort basis here:
https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/4551b947789d3216bacfcb7af25e029e#gistcomment-2799709).

Although I ~ sorta agree, there is a slight counterargument: receiver is
adding utxos, so in the absence of any transaction inspection you're
creating a different distribution than one gets from existing wallet
selection algos. For example:
Note that the most likely/desirable/considered use case may be a
merchant use case (after all, who receives coins most frequently? in
theory, people selling stuff), and it is highly plausible that they
might concentrate larger and larger sums into utxo(s) via use of
PayJoin. Completely mismatched input sizes could be a problem, it's
debatable, and it's also debatable whether it can be avoided, but what I
don't quite buy is that this issue can just be ignored.

And I'm reminded that a related point is made by belcher in the gist
comment thread iirc (after we discussed it on IRC): over time a
"PayJoin-only" merchant doing the simplest thing - using a single utxo
over and over again, will concentrate more and more funds into it, and
inevitably violating UIH2 in an increasingly dramatic fashion
(contributing a 100BTC utxo to a 0.1BTC payment etc.). Suggesting it's
better if there's a mix of payjoin/non-payjoin.
