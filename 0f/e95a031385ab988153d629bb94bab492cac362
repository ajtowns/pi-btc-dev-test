This is especially important if take into account all the projects that 
aim to build upon the bitcoin blockchain and that can have a significant 
impact, both in terms of storage space as well as transaction volume spikes.

Just recently I suggested the need for a BIP to standardize reporting of 
"delay alerts" in wallets, so that users can act accordingly (i.e. 
fee-bump, postpone, cancel) before sending their transactions during 
these periods of increased transaction volume.

IMHO keeping the users informed of potential issues before committing 
transactions to the network can go a long way towards preventing 
frustration and potential backlashes against blockchain tech.
