Interesting.

No worse than the current situation.

High-value transactions should wait for several confirmations.

Again, no worse than the current situation. And regular double-spends
attacks are much simpler than finney attacks.

Where can I read more about "enforcing hashing visibility of block contents"?
Sounds somewhat similar to p2pool to me but I'm not sure I understand it.
