Yea, well. I don?t think it is ethical to post instructions without an associated remediation (BIP) if you don?t see the potential attack.

I was rather hoping that we could have a fuller discussion of what the best practical response would be to such an issue?

Maybe I'm restating what Peter wrote.  If so, confirmation would be nice.
