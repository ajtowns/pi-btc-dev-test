Thanks a lot for the feedback

> I think this could be quite useful, although I don?t know if it will get
adopted.

The good part is that it does not have to be adopted by exchanges. If
popular exchanges do not adopt it, it is trivial to make an adapter service
which translate COX to whatever proprietary API of the exchange.

Collaboration with the exchange is only needed if the exchange wants to
provide a service for taking the risk of volatility.

> I have personally been integrating BitPay into a website for payments in
BTC and like what you are trying to do.  One of the biggest hurdle?s I see
for merchants to adopt BitCoin today is the transaction fee.

This BIP supports alternatives currencies.

>  Can you refer to the kind of best practices Stripe and PayPal recommend?
Should some additional shared-secret or cookie / macaroon based
authentication be added?

Yes, I must add guidelines (SSL and how to manage the addresses). I don't
think authentication is needed as the merchant is the only one having
access to the source URI. This can be considered as a shared secret.
Even if this secret leaks, no funds are in danger.

> Can you clarify if this integration can run in a browser, or due to
security / privacy constraints must be server-to-server?

Thanks, I need to clarify the scope. But indeed, this is not meant to be
used by a browser, as merchants will not host their payment processors on
their mobile or browser.

> Though it?s important to remain future-proof by being flexible, leaving
the above details to individual implementers is probably going to result in
bad things.

Thanks, I think you are right I should add more recommendations for
implementers.

> What are your thoughts on rate limiting vs. privacy? Should a payment
source never return the same address even if nothing is paid to it?
Otherwise someone could just crawl webshops to create an inventory of
payment addresses. A new address every page reload could be a DDOS vector.
It also wouldn't be compatible with BIP44 because of its gap limit,
although I don?t think that?s a huge problem for exchanges.

You are right, I must introduce a sort of "order id" so that one order map
to exactly one address response.
The DDOS vector will then be on the shoulder of the ecommerce website by
preventing users to create too much orders. (they certainly already do)

> Can this be combined with an invoice mechanism similar to Lightning, e.g.
where the exchange sends a pre-image to the users wallet (relayed via and
retained by the web shop) upon receipt of the funds, which they can then
present to the merchant in case something went wrong. Exchanges might be
happy to support this protocol, but they don?t want the burden of dealing
with user support requests, so having signed invoices could help with that.

This protocol can be expanded later for lightning trivially, where the call
to the address source uri also returns a lightning payment request. (BOLT11)

> Speaking of Bisq, it would be neat if merchants can rely on random peer
to peer counterparties to convert to fiat, so their customer information
and revenue figures aren?t in the hands of a single counter party.
Obviously that?s a can of worms today, but it would be nice if the protocol
was able to support that if one day someone figures out the fraud,
compliance and bookkeeping stuff.

Conversion to fiat always need trust, so we must rule out anonymous
parties. If you want to spread on several trusted party, this can be done
transparently at the payment processor level, and does not requires change
to the protocol.

> Finally, why only exchanges? It could make sense fo shopping cart
software to talk to a Bitcoin wallet that?s hosted somewhere else for
similar reasons. Right now the best these plugins can do is hold on to an
XPUB, and I?ve even seen solutions that just send the customers coins to
their own backend wallet and then forward it.

Because BIP70/XPUB already solves the problem. (Which I already use in
BTCPay)
BIP70 is a pain in the ass to implement and does not provide any benefits,
and it does not define a way for the exchange to communicate a rate
attached to the bitcoin address, nor define a way to communicate to the
payment processor the conditions under which they can bear volatility risk.

I will revisit the BIP based on your feedback.

Nicolas,
