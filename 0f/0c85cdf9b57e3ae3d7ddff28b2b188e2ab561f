Like I said, you need to talk to a lawyer.  What exactly would be the 
purpose of any license?  How can someone be a "beneficiary" to a license 
when you can't even explain who holds the license to begin with?  How do 
they "benefit?"  I don't see any purpose to putting a license on the 
Core software or the blockchain because nobody can explain who actually 
holds the license and there is no mechanism to enforce any license and 
there is no revenue to be shared.  The whole discussion makes no sense.
