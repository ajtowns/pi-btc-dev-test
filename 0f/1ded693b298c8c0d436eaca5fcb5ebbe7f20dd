The initial message I replied to stated in part, "Okay so I quite like this
idea. If we start removing at height 630000 or 840000 (gives us 4-8 years
to develop this solution), it stays nice and neat with the halving
interval...."

That is less than 3 years or less than 7 years  away. Much sooner than it
is believed QC or Moore's law could impact bitcoin.  Changing bitcoin so as
to require that early coins start getting "scavenged" at that date seems
unneeded and irresponsible.  Besides, your ECDSA is only revealed when you
spend the coins which does provide some quantum resistance.  Hal was just
an example of people putting their coins away expecting them to be there at
X years in the future, whether it is for himself or for his kids and wife.
