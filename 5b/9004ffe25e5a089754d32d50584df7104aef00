Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Allow cross-site requests of payment requests
Message-ID: <CALKy-wq6FZs39KX-gk2PizEEikLvHhxMkt=OT61fcUchsaLpfg@mail.gmail.com>

Would it be a terrible idea to amend BIP 70 to suggest implementors include
a "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" response header for their payment
request responses? I don't think this opens up any useful attack vectors.

I ask because this would make it practical for pure HTML5 web wallets to
use the payment protocol entirely in-browser. Without this I think it would
be necessary for the server hosting the wallet's HTML to fetch payment
requests on the browser's behalf. This is somewhat inelegant and has
security/resource implications for the back-end.
