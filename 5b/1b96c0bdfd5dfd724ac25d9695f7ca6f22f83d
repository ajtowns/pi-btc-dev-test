Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Announcing Jonas Schnelli as GUI maintainer
Message-ID: <20151113073052.GB19878@amethyst.visucore.com>

Hello,

I'd like to announce Jonas Schnelli as the new GUI maintainer of Bitcoin Core.

He's been very active in this area for the last year, as one example he
redesigned all the icons for 0.11.0, has visualized various network statistics,
and has been continuously improving the user experience. Something Bitcoin Core
very much needs, in my opinion.

Unofficially he has been giving direction in GUI matters for quite a while
already, so this only makes it 'official'.

He will be handling GUI related issues on the github tracker, and assisting on and
merging GUI-related pull requests.

Welcome Jonas to the team!

Wladimir
