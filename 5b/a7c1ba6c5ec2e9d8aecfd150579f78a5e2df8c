My answer is simply "No", you don't have to maintain backward 
compatibility for non-standard tx.

The same question applies to P2SH. Before the deployment of BIP16, one 
could have created a time-locked tx with one of the output was in the 
form of HASH160 <hash> EQUAL. The <hash>, however, is not a hash of a 
valid serialized script, so the output is now permanently frozen.

It also applies to all the OP codes disabled by Satoshi: one could have 
created a time-locked tx with those now disabled OP codes.

Same for BIP65 with the use of OP_NOP2. Following your logic, we can't 
make any softfork related to the script system.

I think it is very important to make it clear that non-standard txs and 
non-standard scripts may become invalid in the future
