Thanks for keeping on-topic, replying to the proposal, and being civil!

It's intended to activate when we have clear and broad consensus around
a hard proposal across the community.

The goal isnt really to get a "gain" here...its mostly to decrease the
worst-case (4MB is pretty crazy) and keep the total size in-line with
what the network could handle. Getting 1MB blocks through the network in
under a second is already incredibly difficult...2MB is pretty scary and
will take lots of work...3MB is over the bound of "yea, we can pretty
for sure get that to work pretty well".

Hmmmmmm...you make a valid point. I was trying to avoid breaking old
transactions, but didnt think too much about time-locked ones.
Hmmmmmm...we could apply the limits to txn that dont have at least one
"newer than the fork input", but I'm not sure I like that either.

There is a clear goal here of NOT using block-based limits and switching
to transaction-based limits. By switching to transaction-based limits we
avoid nasty issues with mining code either getting complicated or
enforcing too-strict limits on individual transactions.
