Agreed. Does Bitcoin Core not have a release cycle policy? Typically mission-critical projects will enter a code and resource freeze prior to tagging a release candidate, after which point only critical bugfixes are allowed into the release branch. A language translation update does not qualify as a critical bugfix and should be merged during the next release cycle.
