Subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.7.1 release candidate 1 ready for testing
Message-ID: <CABsx9T2Y+Ku1DcvWGS+c3p+qRFKbM8O=-CuL=1kC0TZdK1Sz5A@mail.gmail.com>

Any progress on a release candidate QA sanity testing plan?


Bitcoin version 0.7.1 release candidate 1 is now available from:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.7.1/test/

This is a bug-fix minor release.

New features
------------

* Added a boolean argument to the RPC 'stop' command, if true sets
  -detachdb to create standalone database .dat files before shutting down.

* -salvagewallet command-line option, which moves any existing wallet.dat
  to wallet.{timestamp}.dat and then attempts to salvage public/private
  keys and master encryption keys (if the wallet is encrypted) into
  a new wallet.dat. This should only be used if your wallet becomes
  corrupted, and is not intended to replace regular wallet backups.

* Import $DataDir/bootstrap.dat automatically, if it exists.

Dependency changes
------------------

* Qt 4.8.2 for Windows builds

* openssl 1.0.1c

Bug fixes
---------

* When running -testnet, use RPC port 18332 by default.

* Better detection and handling of corrupt wallet.dat and blkindex.dat files.
  Previous versions would crash with a DB_RUNRECOVERY exception, this
  version detects most problems and tells you how to recover if it
  cannot recover itself.

* Fixed an uninitialized variable bug that could cause transactions to
  be reported out of order.

* Fixed a bug that could cause occasional crashes on exit.

* Warn the user that they need to create fresh wallet backups after they
  encrypt their wallet.
