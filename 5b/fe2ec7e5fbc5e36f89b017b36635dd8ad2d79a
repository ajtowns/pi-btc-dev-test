I would echo the need for some kind of moderation. 

I believe Peter Todd is an extremely intelligent individual, who has a
lot to offer the Bitcoin community.  He has a firm grasp of a lot of
really deep Bitcoin concepts and his *technical* insight is generally
positive.  Technically.  But the way he communicates on this list is
*extremely* corrosive and breeds hostility.  It makes it a scary place
to discuss things, with frequent, public ridicule of everything posted. 

I agree that I would rather have a friendly environment to discuss
technicals, even if it means losing additional technical insight. 
People who would explicitly insult other contributors intelligence and
character on a public list should be subject to some kind of negative
reinforcement.   Maybe there's solutions other than outright banning.
