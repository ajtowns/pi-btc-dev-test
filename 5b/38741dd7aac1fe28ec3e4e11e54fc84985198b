I just wanted to say the fact that you're making key generation
auditable, and using deterministic signatures, is a clear sign that you
guys know what you're doing. Hearing this makes me a lot more confident
that the Trezor will prove to be a secure way to store my Bitcoins and
my pre-order will prove to be money well spent.

Kudos!
