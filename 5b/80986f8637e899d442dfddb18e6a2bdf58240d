An attacker with some small hashpower isolates you (as an individual)
from the network by MITMing your network. You just switch the the
attackers chain as if nothing happened because of the network rule
that defines it as OK. Today, you will see that you're behind and warn
the user.

Was it really so hard to write a three-sentence paragraph to clarify
the attack instead of insulting people? Still, posting ideas here
without spending time to ensure you understand the Bitcoin network
well is frowned upon.
