Yes, people have been abusing his name in the block size debate to
present their own personal views, almost from the beginning, and that
has been very annoying.
But I don't remember you proposing to block their emails from the list
in those occasions.
For all I know this could have been the real Satoshi. But I just
maintain what I've said when arguments of authority (an old fallacy)
have been used: only the arguments matter, not who makes them (which
is also what logic says).
Maybe the people using the arguments of authority actually care about
whether the author is Satoshi or not to determine what they think
about what the content says.
But I personally don't care: I can say that I agree with what the post
says no matter if it is written by Satoshi or someone else (because
the identity of the author doesn't change what I think of the
content).
