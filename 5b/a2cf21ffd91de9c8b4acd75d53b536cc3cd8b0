One thing that the below assumption doesn't appear to take into account is
user demand for quick confirmations. I haven't fully thought out the game
theory on this but here goes:

Example: if 75% of hashing power accepts 'medium' fee transactions while
25% is willing to accept low (or any) fee transactions, then a user paying
a lower fee wishing to get their transaction included in the next block
runs a ~75% chance that their transaction won't be included.

Users desiring the most reliably fast confirmations are better off by
paying the minimum fee that a majority of miners will accept. Miners
breaking ranks and accepting lower fees only affects users who aren't
sufficiently interested in quicker confirmations. As long as a majority of
miners 'collude', they will likely be able to keep the average fees higher
than miners with the lower costs of operations might be willing to accept.
