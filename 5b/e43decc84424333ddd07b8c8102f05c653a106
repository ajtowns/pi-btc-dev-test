Maybe I'm new to this, but this doesn't make any sense.  I thought the 
point of the BIP was to collaborate to come up with a good solution.  
That's exactly what I want to do before I implement it in my software.  
After all, they are "Bitcoin Improvement *Proposals*."  It seems like 
EXACTLY what a BIP is for... just no one needs/should use it until it 
removes the "draft" marking.

As for the protocol on top of it, my BIP was not intended to address 
that.  It's only proposing how unsigned transactions can be serialized 
and users can collect addresses.  Whatever system you want to implement 
on top of it to exchange the data is up to the developer.  My only 
motivation is that if the user clicks "Save this proposal to file", that 
any client can use the resulting file, just the same way we serialize 
any other blockdata that has a consistent representation.
