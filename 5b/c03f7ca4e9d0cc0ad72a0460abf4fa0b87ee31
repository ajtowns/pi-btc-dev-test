I did this for a Bitcoin-only Wi-Fi network I operated at a remote festival. We had well over a hundred lightweight wallets, all trying to connect to the Bitcoin P2P network over a very bandwidth-constrained Internet link, so I poisoned the DNS and rejected all outbound connection attempts on port 8333, to force all the wallets to connect to a single local full node, which had connectivity to a single remote node over the Internet. Thus, all the lightweight wallets at the festival had Bitcoin network connectivity, but we only needed to backhaul the Bitcoin network's transaction traffic once.

The Porcupine Freedom Festival ("PorcFest") in New Hampshire last summer. I strongly suspect that it's the largest gathering of Bitcoin users at any event that is not specifically Bitcoin-themed. There's a lot of overlap between the Bitcoin and liberty communities. PorcFest draws somewhere around 1000-2000 attendees, a solid quarter of whom have Bitcoin wallets on their mobile devices.

The backhaul was a 3G cellular Internet connection, and the local Bitcoin node and network router were hosted on a Raspberry Pi with some Netfilter tricks to restrict connectivity. The net result was that all Bitcoin nodes (lightweight and heavyweight) on the local Wi-Fi network were unable to connect to any Bitcoin nodes except for the local node, which they discovered via DNS. I also had provisions in place to allow outbound connectivity to the API servers for Mycelium, Blockchain, and Coinbase wallets, by feeding the DNS resolver's results in real-time into a whitelisting Netfilter rule utilizing IP Sets.

For your amusement, here's the graphic for the banner that I had made to advertise the network at the festival (*chuckle*): http://www.mattwhitlock.com/bitcoin_wifi.png
