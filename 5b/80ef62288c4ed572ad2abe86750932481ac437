Again, along the lines of what Gregory Maxwell is saying, if the payment
instructions you have given to the sender say "don't make funds
spendable with scriptPubKey after this date" why are you scanning those
"old" bitcoin addresses for future payments? That makes no more sense
than taking your p2pkh addresses and scanning for the same scriptPubKey
embedded within a p2sh address - you haven't told anyone to pay you via
that method so why expect anyone to do so?

The sender is free to bury their Bitcoins in a safe in your neighbors
front yard; you have no reason to accept such silly behavior as payment
and every reason to ignore it.
