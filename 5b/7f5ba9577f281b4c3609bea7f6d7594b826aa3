[unimportant update] Turns out that my IPv4 nodes already have
iptables blocking of that subnet, presumably due to other misconduct
there, which might be why I'm not seeing it.

Several other people appear to be observing it, and all it seems to be
doing is listening without sending transactions? e.g. surveillance
node... not the first time thats happened, but the weird tor
non-exit-flagged-exit adds a fun level of intrigue to it.
