Certainly, which brings us back to proximity.

Which reminds me - it's important to keep in mind the scenario that
arises when there is no person present to represent the receiver. Such
as a vending machine purchase.

Proximity in these cases is insufficient, as the receiver is not able to
prevent application of a fraudulent NFC device or replacement of a
static QR code. In these cases BIP-70 becomes essential.
