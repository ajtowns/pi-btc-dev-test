What if a transaction could simply point back to an earlier transaction, 
forming a chain?  Not a separately mined blockchain, just a way to 
establish an official publication (execution) order. Double spends would 
be immediately actionable with such a sequence. Transactions in a block 
could eventually be required to be connected in such a chain.  Miners 
would have to keep or reject a whole mempool chain, since they lack the 
keys to change the sequence.  They would have to prune a whole tx 
subchain to insert a double spend (and this would still require private 
keys to the double spend utxo's).

This idea seemed promising, until I realized that with the collision 
rebasing required, it would barely scale to today's transaction rate.  
Something that scales to 10,000's of transactions per second, and really 
without limit, is needed.

Anyway, I wrote it up here:
