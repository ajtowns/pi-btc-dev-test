Ok, I see your point here, and I was referring to rebuilding from
entropy -- which as you noted is not a real world usage.  It is a
useful implementation test though and at the very least the existing
test vectors would need to be regenerated with each word list change.

I recently added BIP39 to libbitcoin and our implementation would fail
with an arbitrarily new word list because we validate the user
provided word list before converting it to a seed (i.e. we check that
the encoded entropy/checksum line up and warn the user if that's not
the case to distinguish a rubbish word list from a BIP39 mnemonic --
as referenced in the BIP).  You're correct that we could use rubbish
words, but at the moment it's not allowed there.  By removing that
validating 'restriction', I agree with you that word lists have no
need to be fixed.  But realistically, we still don't allow completely
arbitrary words to be used because I don't see the word lists changing
too often, nor implementations storing word lists of all words and
languages.

Thanks for clarifying,
-Neill.

> ^ This is incorrect I think Neill, the reason is that the only thing that happens when you change the wordlist is that entropy points to different words. But remember, entropy is disposed. Yes in my code I allow for the keeping of entropy etc, it also lets me "hot swap" between different language wordlists etc but in real world implementation the entropy is forgotten and not stored. So changing the wordlist merely allows new mnemonic phrases to be generated but it has a nil impact on previously generated mnemonics UNLESS you are trying to rebuild from entropy but you wouldn't do that. You would be rebuilding from the Mnemonic in real world scenario. You really can have a word list of total rubbish in BIP39 as long as it is 2048 words long that is all! If you input the mnemonic made out of rubbish words so for e.g "uyuy jkjasd sdsd sdsdd yuuyu sdsds iooioi sdasds uyuyuy sdsdsd tyyty rwetrtr" and no matter what BIP39 implementation you put it in, it will always generate the same seed bytes thus allowing for complete and universal seed derivation without any reliance on word list. The word list is merely to generate a mnemonic, after that it has no role in seed generation so you can change it at anytime and it will never effect future mnemonics.

Probably not because we don't need to use the wordlist ever again after creation, we literally accept the mnemonic, normalise it then hash it into a seed. From what I'm reading, Electrum 2.0 really should have BIP39, it would take almost no effort to put it in and I think you should do that :) I don't have any interest in BIP39 other than it being a standard. I think TREZOR may have an interest in it?
