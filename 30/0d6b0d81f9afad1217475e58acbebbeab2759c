 >"Decentralization" is a popular buzzword these days, but how about 
stating the problem description in a way that is more precise and 
accurate? One of Bitcoin's differentiating properties is that it 
prevents double spending without using a trusted third party.

I have been researching how it can be defined and measured (at least up 
to a certain point).  Here is a paper on measuring decentralization of 
government functions: 
http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/treisman/Papers/defin.pdf. 
Not exactly the same thing as being discussed here but the paper gives a 
framework of how decentralization metrics could be defined in a somewhat 
standard way.
