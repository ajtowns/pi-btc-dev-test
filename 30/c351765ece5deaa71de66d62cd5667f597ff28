My proposal is about the current signing process (which exists event it it's not perfect) but it could also work with a new signing message system tomorrow. It more about give users an easier way to access existing tools than the "sign message thing" itself.

BTW I'm aware of privacy issues, but could you elaborate on why the use case your are referring to doesn't actually work?
Here are a use of bitcoin signatures ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=497545.0 ) to speak about a real case.
