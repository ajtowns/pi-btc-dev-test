Hi,

I just wanted to let everyone know that every email is also archived at bitcoin-development.narkive.com <http://bitcoin-development.narkive.com/>, where you can find everything since the beginning of the list (June 2011). That should answer to Andy?s concern about the older messages not being archived anywhere but on sourceforge.

Davide
