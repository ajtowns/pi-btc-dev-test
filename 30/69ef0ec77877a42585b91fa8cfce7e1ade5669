Oh? If this was not meant to be a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, perhaps you 
should clarify somewhere what altcoin you are proposing it for. As it stands, 
it certainly did read much like it was meant to be a BIP, and apparently many 
others thought so as well.

Admittedly, the bitcoin-dev ML isn't the place for altcoin discussions, and 
I'm not particularly interested in spending my time aiding altcoins, so I'll 
just end the conversation here until someone re-proposes something similar for 
Bitcoin.

Sorry for confusing the nature of your work,

Luke
