Oups - I was reading the code wrongly - going through AddSupportingTransactions carefully again...

The vtxPrev contains a list of the supporting confirmations up to 3 confirmations back. So it is only of relevance (and only gets filled) if you accept coins that are less than 3 confirmations old. In this case you would like to resend the depending transactions to the network in case of chain splits.

This makes much more sense, but also, it is only of relevance when you accept newly earned coins. And it will only be of relevance for half an hour or so.

Cheers,

Michael
