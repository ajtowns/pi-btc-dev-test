I do think it would motivate some people to fix a bug or two, though I
would say it wouldn't encourage long-term contributors, just a bunch of
hacked together patches which "fix" a bug.

I know jgarzik hates the idea of branching for releases, but quite a few
projects do that, and it seems to work fairly well.  I would support the
idea of starting with 0.4 and branching for bugfixes to an 0.4 branch,
then adding new features to a head branch to be eventually called 0.5.
