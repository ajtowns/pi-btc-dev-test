It would be very useful to not only be able to switch filtering on and off
globally...but to be able to switch on a per-connection basis. But then
again, perhaps it would be smarter to ditch the whole bloom filter thing in
favor of an actual client/server architecture with proper authentication
and access controls.

The RPC was supposed to be this client/server architecture...but in
practice it sucks so bad for doing anything beyond administering a node
instance you fully control yourself that I eschewed it entirely in my
wallet design.
