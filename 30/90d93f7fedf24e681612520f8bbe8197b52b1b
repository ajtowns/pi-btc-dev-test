This would not be soft-forking compatible.

It also would be unsafe in that it would result in transactions which
once mined could not be restored in a reorg through no fault of the
participants, which makes the coins less fungible and differently safe
to accept. It risks creating weird pressures around immediate block
admission since a one additional block delay could forever censor such
a transaction (E.g. increases the power of single miners to censor or
steal). Avoiding this is a conscious decision in Bitcoin and also part
of the justification for the 100 block maturity of newly generated
coins.

It also would require violating the script/transaction/block layering
more substantially, complicating implementations, and making the
validity of a script no longer a deterministic pure function of the
transaction.

Avoiding these issues is a conscious design in OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.
I would strenuously oppose a proposal which failed in any of these
respects.

You can already achieve the not spendable after logic with a
cancellation spend that moves the coin in the usual way. (Which
doesn't even require the participant be online, with the help of some
network service to queue unlocked transactions).

It is intentionally so, and yet it covers the intended use cases;
including ones with alternative key groups, they are just not
exclusive.
