Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bip44 extension for P2SH/P2WSH/...

The whole idea of BIP43 (which BIP44 bases on) is that how these BIPs
define balance retrieval never changes. This is to make sure you always
see the same balance on "same BIP" wallets (and same seed of course).

So if you want to add paths, it has to be a new BIP.
