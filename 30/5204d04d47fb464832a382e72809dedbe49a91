You don't have to MM from birth. That I've already agreed is
dangerous. But if you start with SHA256, then merged mining is a
trivial fork at least 3 currencies have done successfully.
As said we plan to make Freicoin merge-mineable in the future, and we
expect to get much more security after we do.
The only "adverse" effect may be a temporary drop in price due to the
new miners selling all the frc they get until a new price equilibrates
with the demand. But that's not really "bad for the currency", just to
the holders at that moment.

If a system doesn't compensate its miners in a liquid enough way, the
system will probably be insecure, but that's another topic...
