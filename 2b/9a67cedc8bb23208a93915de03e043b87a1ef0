I meant only to convey that the document would appear on bitcoincore.org
iff the PR were ultimately accepted. In other words, while it is up to
"the community of Core Contributors" in a philosophical sense, it is up
to the maintainers of BitcoinCore.org in a practical sense, because they
are the ones who ultimately decide if the standard has been met.

I think it is perfectly reasonable to keep site-updates narrowly
organized in the GitHub PR sphere (and to ignore everything else).

I appreciate you saying that. Thank you.
