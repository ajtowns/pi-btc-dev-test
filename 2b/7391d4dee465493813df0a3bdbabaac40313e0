Would this not be solved by putting a expiration on application of this
logic?  For instance, if you haven't received the full new block within
5-10 seconds (perhaps adjusted based on local bandwidth), then the
header-received time is ignored.  Or is this too hacky?   I suppose this
is exactly what Ashley is trying to solve, she's just already made a few
more leaps forward in the design process than I have.  I'll stop
derailing it.
