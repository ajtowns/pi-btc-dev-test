Note that merge-avoidance implemented in conjunction CoinJoin doesn't
have this problem - the CoinJoin'd transaction either does or doesn't
confirm. Meanwhile being able to avoid merges, or more precisely, being
able to be flexible with them, makes achiving good value-privacy much
easier.

Secondly merge-flexibility also makes cut-thru payments possible. For
example BitPay can direct customers paying for goods to pay to addresses
controlled by merchants and other parties who are owed money by BitPay.
This skips a step, saving on transction fees as well as increasing
privacy. Notably in this case the only parties that have to deal with
accounting complexity are BitPay and the merchants - consumers' wallet
software needs no changes beyond generic payment protocol support, and
notably you can even use this technique without the payment protocol.

See my post "DarkWallet Best Practices" for more info:

What specifically do you dislike about X.509? The technical standard or
the infrastructure around it? (IE the centralized authorities)
