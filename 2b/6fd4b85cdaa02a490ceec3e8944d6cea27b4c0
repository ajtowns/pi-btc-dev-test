+1 and thank you. I've prototyped a couple different Bitcoin projects that
would benefit from this.

I'm traveling with poor 'net so I haven't read the patches yet. I echo pull
request comments about using Accept and Accept-Encoding headers. Same for
an API version number in the URL.

It'd be helpful, eventually, to have APIs corresponding to Bitcoin addr and
version messages.  Metadata about the network and the peer, respectively,
are valuable in my use cases.
