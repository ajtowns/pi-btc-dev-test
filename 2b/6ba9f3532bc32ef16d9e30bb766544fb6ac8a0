Ok I think I've got a good understanding of where we're at now. I can
promise that the next person to waste your time in 30 days will not be me.
I'm pleasantly surprised to see a community that doesn't kickban newcomers
and takes the time to explain (re-explain) concepts.

Hoping to add *beneficial* thoughts in the future!
