Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal to allow users to configure the maximum
 block weight based on a support threshold
Message-ID: <1495536637.1801543.985680712.6B788409@webmail.messagingengine.com>

I have a proposal that would allow each user to optionally configure the
maximum block weight at a support threshold.

It recognizes that there is no need for off chain bickering, by
providing a mechanism that lets each users freely choose their own
parameters while still maintaining full coordination of any changes.

The BIP can be found here: 

https://github.com/tomasvdw/bips/blob/master/bip-changing-the-maximum-block%20weight-based-on-a-support-threshold.mediawiki

It is worth noting that this proposal does neither gives more power to
miners nor reduces decentralization. Miners still rely on their blocks
being accepted by economic nodes to sell their minted coins. This
proposal doesn't change that.
