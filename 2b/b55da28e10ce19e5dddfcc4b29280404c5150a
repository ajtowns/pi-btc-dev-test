So, what about native build script generation for other platforms? autotools
can only generate makefiles (with at least two intermediate code generation
steps), which is quite limited.

IMO cmake is simple and elegant compared to the autotools monster. I don't
see why it would be "just as bad". And I have quite some experience with
both systems. Autotools is a hell to debug. cmake certainly isn't perfect,
but at least it's a leap forward.

Yes, apart from that only obscure projects such as LLVM,  Blender, and
OpenCV are using it. Nothing of any importance.

BTW for cmake there is "ccmake" which is even better than configure --help
as it offers an interactive interface for configuration.
