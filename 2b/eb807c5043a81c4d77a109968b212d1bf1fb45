You've got a major social engineering problem here. 

1) who is marketing privacy 
2) how do you validate 'privacy providers' 

Just like all the scamcoins, there will be scamprivacy providers, which will
drive the market price of privacy down to zero.

Who's paying the network/development/bandwidth/etc cost for privacy?

I'd guess 85% of real users don't really care about some abstract 'privacy'
ideal, they just want payments to work and to download cat pictures.

If you say 'regular address re-use is deprecated, and the top 1% in bitcoin
weatlh who own 95% of the miners want privacy', well fine. But you just 
opened yourself up to 'OccupyBitcoin', and an altcoin that ENCOURAGES plain
old regular address re-use and transparency.

Does this stuff still work if regular address re-use is a transparency feature
and not a bug?
