Yeah I was thinking something like that on the walk home. But 2 years is
a long time. Do we have enough RAM for that? Plus warranties usually
result in the defective goods being replaced rather than a monetary
refund, right?

But adjusting the spec so there's a fixed time limit, and allowing a
future version of the protocol to make it configurable, does indeed feel
like the right way to go.
