Yes, your differentiation is spot on. My main goal is to eliminate the risk
of detaching transactions in  off-blockchain protocols that rely on a
number of transactions being chained, hence solving signature malleability
might be the correct term. Canonical encodings do address part of the
problem, however they do nothing in the case of one of the signers
re-signing a transaction and detaching any followup transaction. Also
having transaction templates is a nice way to reduce the complexity of
protocols by eliminating some of the "who signs what when" gotchas.
Segregated witnesses would be a perfect solution, we just need to find a
good migration plan for Bitcoin :-)

Sorry for the confusion caused by me misusing the term malleability, I'll
use signature malleability in the future :-)
