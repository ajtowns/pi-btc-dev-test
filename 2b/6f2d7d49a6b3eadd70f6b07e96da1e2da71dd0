There's a bigger problem here honestly. The p2p network is just starved for
connectable slots.

You can start up a bitcoind, on a host with sufficient connectivity, with
-maxconnections=512 and they will fill in <15 minutes.

As to why sort by version: <=3.23 has problems serving the blocks from the
last 2 months. It can take days to weeks to get the whole chain if you're
connecting to those nodes.
