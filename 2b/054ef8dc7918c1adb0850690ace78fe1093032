Yeah, you'd be limited to simple usecases. X509 signing or lots of
outputs will make the QR code hard to scan. However, if all you want to
do is send to a custom script (without using P2SH) I invite you to have
a look at

https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/blob/master/wallet/src/de/schildbach/wallet/ui/InputParser.java#L86

https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/blob/master/wallet/src/de/schildbach/wallet/util/Qr.java#L134

https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/blob/master/wallet/src/de/schildbach/wallet/util/Base43.java

Basically it's "BITCOIN:-" plus the payment request in Base43 encoded
form. I picked Base43, because that's optimized for QR codes.

The goal is to allow device to generate a multi-output payment request on its own, without relying on the server and x509 certificates. When scanned via QR code from, say, POS, it's pretty secure, so no additional authentication needed.
