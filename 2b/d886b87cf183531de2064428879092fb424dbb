Good point.

There are actually times you may want to sign a transaction.

There's a little know HTTP code, 402, "Payment Required".  We should really
start using this at some point ...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

Reserved for future use.[2] The original intention was that this code might
be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, but
that has not happened, and this code is not usually used. As an example of
its use, however, Apple's defunct MobileMe service generated a 402 error if
the MobileMe account was delinquent.[citation needed] In addition, YouTube
uses this status if a particular IP address has made excessive requests,
and requires the person to enter a CAPTCHA.
