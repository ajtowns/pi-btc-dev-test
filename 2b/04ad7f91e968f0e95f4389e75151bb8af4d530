That seems reasonable.

The other message should be implementable today, I think? If numBroadcastPeers > 0 post 0.10.3 then you know the tx made it out to the internet.

Unfortunately if nodes start to diverge a lot in terms of what they will accept, then ?transmitted? is no longer a clean binary yes/no thing. Guess we?ll have to jump that hurdle when we come to it.

The payment protocol at least would need some notion of fee, or possibly (better?) the ability for a recipient to specify some inputs as well as some outputs.

Originally I think we were hoping for child-pays-for-parent. I guess that needs someone to sit down and focus on it for a while, assuming we still think that?s a good idea.
