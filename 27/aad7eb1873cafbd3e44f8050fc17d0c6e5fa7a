I can see the PR advantages, but isn't mapping from one massively long, 
multi-character, human-opaque number (IBAN) to another (bitcoin address) a 
bit of a waste of time?

Surely the point of all this is to provide at least the possibility of a 
human-readable name for a bitcoin-address?

Isn't there a possibility that one day we might want to be able to say "send 
me those bitcoins you owe me to bitcoin.yahoo.co.uk/andyparkins"?  Or 
similar?
