I'm firmly against a *blackout* - it would harm users' trust in Bitcoin 
since people looking to download the client or to get information about 
Bitcoin may end up in the wrong place. I constantly have to delete 
YouTube spam advertising this or that "miracle GPU miner" or "secure 
Bitcoin client", which of course are all just the same trojan.

As for making a statement or putting up a banner - that's ok with me.
