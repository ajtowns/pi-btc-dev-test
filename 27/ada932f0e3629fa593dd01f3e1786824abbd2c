One important use case is importing xpubs for watch-only accounts. This
is necessary for hardware wallets and there are other valid use cases
for this.

Yes, in general it is not a good idea to import private keys and many
wallets don't even have an option to give out the xprv (except
indirectly via the backup mechanism).  But even when sweeping a
bip-44+segwit wallet you need to know where the segwit addresses are.
