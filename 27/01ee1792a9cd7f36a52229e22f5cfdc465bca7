No, as previously explained, once libconsensus is complete it can be
moved to a separate repository like libsecp256k1.
At first it will need to be a subtree/subrepository of Bitcoin Core
(like libsecp256k1 currently is), but I still don't undesrtand how
that can possibly be a problem for alternative implementations (they
can use a subtree as well if they want to). Depending on a separated
libconsensus doesn't "make Bitcoin Core a dependency" more than
depending on libsecp256k1 currently does.

I believe the simplest option would be to fork the libconsensus
project and do the schism/controversial/contentious hardfork there.
But of course modifying libconsensus will be much easier than
modifying Bitcoin Core (if anything, because the amount of code is
much smaller).

Unfortunately I only directly contacted libbitcoin because I was
subscribed to the list at the time (maybe I'm still subscribed, not
really sure).
The other attempts to get feedback from other alternative
implementations have been just mostly-ignored threads in bitcoin-dev.
So, no, I cannot facilitate such a discussion, but I'm more than happy
to collaborate to achieve our mutual goal.
