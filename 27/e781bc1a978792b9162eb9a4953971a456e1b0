This BIP doesn't change that. Enforcement remains primarily by users.

You assume users will pay for signalling of softforks prematurely. So long as 
it waits until deployment of the softfork is widespread, this risk is minimal. 
At worst, it creates risks similar to a UASF. So long as UASF is the 
alternative, this way seems strictly better.

How so?

Fixed, thanks.
