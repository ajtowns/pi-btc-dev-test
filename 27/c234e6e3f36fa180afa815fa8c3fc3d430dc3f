Sadly today Electrum requires more than a full node, it requires a
number of large additional indexes over what a full node has and
pruning is precluded. I don't think that increasing the resource
utilization of the node is a good way to go there for the purposes
expressed here. (not that electrum couldn't be used here, but not
unmodified without the resource usage increasing route)

Bitcoin's own P2P protocol is already the API for a ordinary SPV
client. So I don't believe any new API would be require, except
perhaps for some process management stuff (which also isn't provided
for Electrum).
