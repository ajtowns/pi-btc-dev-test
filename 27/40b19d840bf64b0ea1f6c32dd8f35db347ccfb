So hypothetically if wallets/payments processors/full nodes adoption
will take 6 month to get to 50% after the segwit soft-fork activation, this
means that actual network capacity will be increased by:

1.75 x 0.5 + 1 x 0.5 = 1.375

after six month.

An hard-fork on the others side would bring 1.75 since the activation, am I
right?
