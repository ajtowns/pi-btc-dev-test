Yes, that is essentially what BIP 30 did.

We want to do this also, partly for "belt and suspenders" security but
mostly for two reasons:

1. To test using block/transaction version numbers to smoothly roll
out changes. The next change we need to make might be prompted by some
crisis; better to learn any lessons now, when we have the luxury of
time to fix problems that might crop up.

2. We think we'll all appreciate the change in a year or three, when
the whole network has upgraded and we can start writing code that
assumes all new blocks past a certain checkpoint contain their height;
that should make it easier to do things like figure out whether or not
an orphan chain can possibly be part of the main chain.
