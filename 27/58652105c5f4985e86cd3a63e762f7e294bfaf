Also Wagner's algorithm shouldn't be applicable for a number of reasons.
you can't birthday attack something where there's only a single variable
that you can modify.    And when you change the equation from additive you
now have a multi-dimensional equation we're partitioning won't function.
this is the basis of the perfect security of Shamir secret sharing.
