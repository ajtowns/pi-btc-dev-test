For reference, there was a brief time where I was irritated that the
size had been reduced to 40 bytes, because I had an application where I
wanted to put ECDSA in signatures in the OP_RETURN, and you're going to
need at least 64 bytes for that.   Unfortunately I can't remember now
what that application was, so it's difficult for me to argue for it. 
But I don't think that's an unreasonable use case:  sending a payment
with a signature, essentially all timestamped in the blockchain.
