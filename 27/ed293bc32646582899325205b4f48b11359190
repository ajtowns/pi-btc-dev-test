Cam, your scenario makes no sense.

This would obliterate any confidence in Bitcoin Core. I seriously doubt
anyone would actually be ok with a pull request implementing this.

Who would bother writing this code, let alone trading on these markets?

> 4. Setup a fork of Bitcoin XT that allows people to easily make a
transaction only on the XT fork (while leaving the original BTC coins
untouched).

I doubt this is even possible.
