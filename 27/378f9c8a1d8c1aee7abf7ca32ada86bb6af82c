Seems like the wrong approach to me, because in practice you really need
a reasonable expiration date or some way of determining that whatever you
are paying
is still around (I still get random transactions to the Bitcoin Faucet's
old addresses).

See the discussion from January about extending the payment protocol for
recurring transactions:

https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net/msg03823.html

"Give them a single token" == "give them a recurring PaymentRequest" in my
mind. Or maybe "Give them a URL where they can fetch PaymentRequests
whenever they need to make a payment" or maybe "Give them an array of
PaymentRequests for the next X days/months/years of payments."
