I think *your* plan is an ecologically and socially rational plan. My 
observations of irrational responses on this list lead me to believe
there is a single entity (which may be a cartel) which *effectively*
controls between 30% and 50% of the sha-256 hashing power and is quite
terrified of any alternative, and attempts to purchase, consume, or 
eliminate any entities that might dilute it's controlled hash rate or
pose a risk of switching to a new algorithm.

We must have a system in which 1 to 10% of the hashrate can provide a
reasonable check-and-balance and competitive pressure to 90% of the
hash rate, or it's going to be fundamentally unstable, and we will
just re-create 'to big to fail' all over again.

You speak of ecological crime without proposing any mechanism in which 
the ecologically correct thing is also the economically rational thing.

If I could get real-time MISO market pricing for wind energy, I could 
do this http://grid.coop/smartgridcmp-long.png and run a mining farm
on my farm.

I would like to propose we collaborate on developing secure mechanism
to audit energy sources for miners on a new chain called 'Ecocoin' in
which the block reward is proportional to how much energy the owner
of the newly generated block reward personally harvested from renewable
sources.

The reward curve will have to be calibrated and adjusted to minimize
the over all costs and fraud risk of auditing the energy input sources.
