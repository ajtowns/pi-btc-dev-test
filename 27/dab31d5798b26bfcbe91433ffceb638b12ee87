Blockheight depends on the chain. XPUB is not tied to particular
chain/coin.

Also there are already cryptocurrencies that do not use blockchain, but
directed acyclic graph (DAG) for storing transactions. So it would not
be obvious what number to use as a blockheight.

OTOH all blockchains contain timestamps in their blocks, so we can use that.
