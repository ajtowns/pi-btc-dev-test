Thank you for posting that, most informative, and suggest people
arguing here lately to read it carefully.

May I suggest that people who wish to debate what rough consensus
means, to take it to this reddit thread

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ntga9/bitcoindev_a_brilliant_post_on_defining_consensus/

Thanks again for posting, helpful context/reminder for all.
