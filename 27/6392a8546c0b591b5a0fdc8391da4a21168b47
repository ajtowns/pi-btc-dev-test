You might want to look at http://www.monotone.ca/, it does a good job
of integrating crypto and review primitives into the workflow.
It also has some reliable network distribution models (netsync) that work
well over things like Tor, in case a new developer (or old Satoshi) doesn't
wish to be in the public light.

Once you have the crypto, it always boils down to human risk factors,
rogue, password, cracks, etc which are harder.
