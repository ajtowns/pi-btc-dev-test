I'm way late to this one, I guess, but adding some thoughts here... it
seems that anything which mitigates the problem of reuse should be to
the maximum extent possible, the user's option... if a person wants to
have an address that lasts forever they should be able to have it...
if they want to have an address that expires they should be able to
have it.

The reuse problem is, I think, better solved by the presentation of
stealth address proposals, and would be handled by a stealth BIP (BIP
63) which has been recently re-discussed here:
