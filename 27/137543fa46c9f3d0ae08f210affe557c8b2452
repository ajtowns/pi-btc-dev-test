This looks like the beginnings of some great analysis.

Per Peter's remarks, I think it would be productive to run the test(s) on a
simulated network with worst case network failure(s) so that we can
determine the safety margin needed.

I have potential access to h/w resources that would be available for
running such tests at the necessary scales.

Cheers,

p.
