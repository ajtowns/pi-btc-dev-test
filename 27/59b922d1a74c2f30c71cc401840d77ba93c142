Nor do you gain anything. Archive nodes will still need to exist
precisely because paper wallets don't include UTXO data. This is like
adding the ability to partially seed a movie with bittorrent. You
still need someone who has the whole thing has to be participating in
order for anyone to play the movie.

This isn't going to kill bitcoin, but it won't make it any better.
Every paper wallet would have to be re-printed with UTXO data
included. It doesn't even solve the core problem because someone can
still flood the network with lots of UTXOs, as long as they spend them
quickly.
