Your suggested modification seems sound.

Though, a script author could do something similar right now by
prefacing his IF with this:

    OP_DUP OP_DUP OP_0 OP_EQUAL OP_SWAP OP_1 OP_EQUAL OP_BOOLOR
OP_NOTIF OP_RETURN OP_ENDIF [actual OP_IF goes here]

That checks whether the input is 0 or 1, and runs OP_RETURN if not.
Your way is cleaner, though.
