Thanks for the work you (and your collegue) put into this paper!  It is
definitely a good step in the right direction!

Do you know [1]?  I've only glanced at both papers, but it seems that's
also a research paper about Bitcoin & co.

Apart from that, let me advertise myself a little bit. ;)  In case you

(preprint without paywall).

Good luck with your further research!
