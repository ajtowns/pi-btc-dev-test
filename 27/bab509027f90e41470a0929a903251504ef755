Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin URI for multiple addresses without using URLs
Message-ID: <562E1893.2070209@willwhite.uk>

Dear bitcoin-dev,

I'm making a website to tell my bitcoin wallet program to donate to more 
than one address at a time. BIP71 needs me to include a URL to do this, 
and then the wallet has to find out the information from the URL. I'd 
prefer to just send my wallet a URI with all the information it needs to 
make the donations.

Please would you tell me if this idea is BIP-able?

Will
