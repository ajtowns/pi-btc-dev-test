Oh, like I did 3 hours ago?  Gah!  I replied directly to grarpamp by
accident.  Sorry if this seems out of place now...

I'm all for sorting the clients by "ease of use".  We want the smoothest
first experience greeting users new to Bitcoin.  I have grand plans of
defaulting Armory to a standard user mode that is standalone, easy to use,
etc.  But until then, Armory will remain an a power-users thing, and I'd
prefer not to have Bitcoin n00bs emailing me for support before they know
what Bitcoin-Qt is, or, more likely, installing Armory alone and then
walking away when nothing works.

As someone else mentioned previously, the advanced stuff will generally be
found by advanced users.  I think it should still receive exposure through
these means, but not on the top/first row.

I personally think the page should say something like "New to Bitcoin?
Start experiencing Bitcoin with My Phone <menu of phone options>, or My
Desktop <menu of desktop options>"  Put the top 3 on each and either a
button for "More Options", or a short list of other options without
screenshots, and just descriptions with links.  Ideally, it would be sorted
by popularity, because that's probably the most important metric that ties
together all features into a single number, but we don't have good stats on
that.  For now, we settle this by putting Bitcoin-Qt up front, and sort
everything else by how easy it is for users to get started and perceived
popularity and disagreements can be settled by semi-regular rotation.

For now, I don't think ordering is super important.  No one here is
threatening lawsuits for improper placement, and the rotation will be good
to keep the main Bitcoin page looking less stagnant, and slowly exposing
repeat visitors to the variety of options available.
