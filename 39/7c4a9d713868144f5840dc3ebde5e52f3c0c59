No, this one is impossible and you don't care in fact, as long as the
system forbids the nodes to position themselves where they like and can
check that the nodes are behaving correctly, same people's nodes/IPs
would then just do the job

And if you add to this a rewarding system that is not necessarily
profitable then you eliminate the incentive for sybil attacking the
network (like the "tip" proposal today) while motivating those that have
the resources to run full nodes, then increasing independence
