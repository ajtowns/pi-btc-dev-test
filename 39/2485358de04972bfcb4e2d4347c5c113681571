My thoughts:

The extension is simple. It's only really useful for the use-cases listed if the majority of nodes implement it. As I view the proposal, it is perfectly simple and uncomplicated. If it's implemented, then I suggest to just increment version and make it part of the protocol.

On the flipside it is another notch in complicating an already diffuse protocol, but it seems a rather benign offense in that regard compared to other changes (past and future).

I like the idea of being able to query the memory pool of a node; the
implementation is straightforward, which is good. Maybe effectively using the
command can be added? I suppose it is interesting in general for nodes to
get a memory pool refill at startup anyway.

I'm not sure about this last. What is it good for? inv packets can always be
sent, even not in response to others, so it is not that this gives you an
acknowledgement the mempool is updated?

This seems safe, although it forces other full implementations that want to
expose protocol version 60002 (or later) to also implement this. What do they
think about this?

I would like to suggest to allocate an extra service bit for this. We still
have 63 left, and this is a well-defined and useful extra service that was
not yet provided by any earlier node. Doing that would also mean that
mempool-providing survices may be discovered before connecting to them, as
the service bits are carried around in addr messages. Any opinions about that?
