Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Random order for clients page
Message-ID: <1341849295.94710.YahooMailNeo@web121003.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Took me a while, but finally got it working.

Entries on the clients page are randomly ordered when the page is generated.

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org/commit/6850fc8c83494d6ec415ea9d36fb98366373cc03

We should regenerate the page every 2 days. This gives fair exposure to all the clients listed.
