Let?s be absolutely clear about one thing - block size increases are *not* about scaling the network. Can we please stop promoting this falsehood? It doesn?t matter by what number we multiply the block size?we can NEVER satisfy the full demand if we insist on every single transaction from every single person everywhere in the world being on the blockchain?it?s just absurd.

Increasing block size only temporarily addresses one significant issue - how to postpone having to deal with transaction fees, which by design, are how the cost of operating the Bitcoin network (which is already very expensive) is supposed to be paid for ultimately. Suggesting we avoid dealing with this constitutes a new economic policy - dealing with it is the default economic policy we?ve all known about from the beginning?so please stop claiming otherwise.

Exactly. There?s been tremendous progress here in addressing scalability, yet I don?t see you participating in that discussion, Gavin.

I agree with what you?re saying, Jorge?but It?s even worse than that. The July 4th fork illustrated that the security model of the network itself could be at risk from the increasing costs in validation causing people to rely on others to validate for them?and increasing block size only makes the problem worse.
