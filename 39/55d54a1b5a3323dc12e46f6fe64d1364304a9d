You must be really tired.

Please read the whole pull request discussing this loathsome subject her
e:

https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/899

It was fairly detailed and conclusive. I'm not being a dumdum when I
say that it is controversial.

Everybody here is well aware of what this sad proposal is.  See
detailed reply to the moaning and groaning of Hearn on this subject,
where he claimed that "the difference between hard and soft forks is
actually quite small, has got smaller with time and is thus hardly the
policy-founding chasm you seem to think it is."  He was wrong, of
course.  Thus, my reply to that, which I won't bother to quote in
detail but which you can read here:

Given the state in which bitcoin is in now, one could say that things
are fairly horrible, but by no means necessitating, as you put it, a
schism hardfork.  It is clear and evidenced by my previous posts and
others that Hearn's efforts are an attack on the bitcoin network.

It's not totally fine at all.  It shouldn't even exist.  People are
doing other unsuspecting users a disservice by even suggesting that it
should be downloaded.

 The big problem is
> BIP101 being deployed as a Schism hardfork.

This is certainly a problem.
