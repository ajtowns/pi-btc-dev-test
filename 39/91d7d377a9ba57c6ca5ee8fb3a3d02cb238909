I've written up a document about all the different methods on how the
payment protocol (both the old one and BIP70) is used in Bitcoin Wallet.
It only provides an overview -- I plan to go into details with separate
(BIP?) documents where needed.

If you have any questions about compatibility, don't hesitate to contact me.
