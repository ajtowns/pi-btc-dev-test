At least there's always an 'exit' option. At this point it would be more realistic to create a sidechain, or altcoin with larger blocks, and not experiment with the current one in-flight. Then you won't risk the other 'passengers' who don't consent to it.

It's important to face reality instead of being wishful here. I'd also have preferred to have one happy family, but it is clear that is not the case, and pretending is only going to cause damage by creating false expectations, or eventually even double-spending possibility because of conflicting forks.
