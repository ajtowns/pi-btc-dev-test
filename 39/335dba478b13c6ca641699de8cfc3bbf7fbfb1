Subject: [Bitcoin-development] does "stubbing" off Merkle trees reduce
 initial download bandwidth?

It can speed up the initial chain download. A newly created wallet will
have only new key-pairs, hence no incoming transactions (unless we have a
key collision, which is unlikely). So there is no need for a bootstrapping
node to download the chain with transactions. The chain itself can be
verified without the transactions. Later full blocks would be required to
detect usable inputs for future outgoing transactions. As long as you
verify the very last blocks in the chain you can be sure that all
preceeding blocks were also valid.

HTH,
Chris
