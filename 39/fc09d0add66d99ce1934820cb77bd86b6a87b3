Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Miners forced to run non-core code in order to get
	segwit activated
Message-ID: <CAJowKgLtu-HUDuakk4DDU53nyChbQk_zY=f5OO2j1Za95PdL7w@mail.gmail.com>

Are we going to merge BIP91 or a -BIP148 option to core for inclusion in
the next release or so?

Because a large percentage of miners are indifferent, right now miners have
to choose between BIP148 and Segwit2x if they want to activate Segwit.

Should we be forcing miners to choose to run non-core code in order to
activate a popular feature?
