The Bitcoin.org Development Guide has grown by leaps in bounds this year,
and has two great introductions:

1. https://bitcoin.org/en/development for an overview of how a developer
can contribute,
2. https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference for in-detail reference to
how the whole system works.

Other great places to get involved or find more detail include the Bitcoin
Wiki <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page> and the #bitcoin-dev room on
Freenode <irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-dev>.

Hope that helps!
