No, the problem is not bitcoin being under any kind of attack by the
forks for me, but the forks fooling people because, again, reusing the
bitcoin core code is too easy

I don't know if there can be a legal solution to this which would keep
some open source aspect of the code, but at least it deserves to be studied
