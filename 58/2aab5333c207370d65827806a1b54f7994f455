I'm assuming the optimized protocol would be forward-error-coded (e.g.
using IBLTs)  and NOT require the full solution (or follow-on weak blocks)
to be exactly the same.

Yup, although I don't get the 'merge mined' bit; the weak blocks are
ephemeral, probably purged out of memory as soon as a few full blocks are
found...

I don't see any incentive problems, either. Worst case is more miners
decide to skip validation and just mine a variation of the
highest-fee-paying weak block they've seen, but that's not a disaster--
invalid blocks will still get rejected by all the non-miners running full
nodes.

If we did see that behavior, I bet it would be a good strategy for a big
hashrate miner to dedicate some of their hashrate to announcing invalid
weak blocks; if you can get your lazy competitors to mine it, then you
win....
