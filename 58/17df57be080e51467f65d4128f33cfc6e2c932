That is a good point.  Since the point is the change is to use good
practice right back until the genesis block, maybe the scriptSig for
coinbases could be replaced by the height expressed as a varint.  That
means that all coinbases get a unique normalized txid.  The coinbases with
duplicate txids still wouldn't be spendable though.
