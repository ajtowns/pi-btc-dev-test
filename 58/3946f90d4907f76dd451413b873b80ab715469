Subject: [Bitcoin-development] P2P tests: peers.dat's requested

Hi All,
I am currently running some tests on the peering system in Bitcoind for a
research paper. We hope to develop improvements which we can share with the
community. A wide diversity of real peers.dat files would be very helpful.
If you are willing, please email me your peers.dat.
Thanks,
