Miners can always reduce the block size (if they coordinate).  Increasing
the maximum block size doesn't necessarily cause an increase.  A majority
of miners can soft-fork to set the limit lower than the hard limit.

Setting the hard-fork limit higher means that a soft fork can be used to
adjust the limit in the future.

The reference client would accept blocks above the soft limit for wallet
purposes, but not build on them.  Blocks above the hard limit would be
rejected completely.
