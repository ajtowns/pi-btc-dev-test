You're completely correct. You can use the same nTweak value for each
filter and then slice up the filters bitwise, but then you end up
linking every query you make to your identity unless you just used a
fixed nTweak that everyone else uses.  (e.g. zero) If you do that, you
still have the problem that you're greatly increasing the load on the
network.

In any case, all this shows is that in the future bloom filters will
very likely go away eventually, and to make that upgrade path smooth it
only makes sense to define a way for nodes to let others know whether or
not bloom is supported. A NODE_BLOOM service bit is a very reasonable
and simple way to do exactly that, and is defacto what implementations
that don't support bloom filters do anyway.

Note BTW that re: DNS seeds, once the NODE_BLOOM BIP is accepted and the
NODE_BLOOM patch merged into bitcoind, I'll write a patch for sipa's
seeder to make it only return seeds with bloom filter support.
