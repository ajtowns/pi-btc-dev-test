Miners earn bitcoins, and clearly a network where reasonable certainty 
can be achieved with 0-confirm transactions is more useful, thus will 
result in those bitcoins being more valuable. One would expect rational 
miners (or pool operators) to want to collaborate to reduce the 
possibilities for double spend attacks as much as possible.
