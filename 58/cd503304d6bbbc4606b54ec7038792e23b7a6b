Codebase forks with nonconsensus features are totally fine! It?s the bitterness and resentment that arose out of the need to get everyone to agree on something that not everyone really needs to agree on that?s the problem.

That is to be _encouraged_. I also maintain my own Bitcoin fork with a specific (non-consensus) feature for the same reason and I am perfectly happy with the arrangement, as are my userbase.

Regardless of whether or not you agree with the merits of Mike?s ideas here, fact is having nodes that support BIP64 would not fundamentally break the Bitcoin network.

Many of these fork proposals are actually conflating different features, only some of which would actually be consensus layer changes. When people proposing nonconsensus features get pushback from Core developers they feel rejected and are likely to team up with others trying to push for hard forks and the like.
