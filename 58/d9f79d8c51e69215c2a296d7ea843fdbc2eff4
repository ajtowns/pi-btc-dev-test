The API implementation is not what is centralizing, nor is full indexation non-scalable. The centralization is in not running the API from a node under your own control. This is of course implied by the comment, ?without the need for syncing?. In other words it is the deployment cost of the node that is centralizing.

Yet if people relied only on bitcoind and never centralized services there would be *no* block explorers (and no secure light wallets), because it does not provide remote query and does not fully index.

Block explorers and light wallets are pretty useful, so presumably some API must provide these features (ideally with reduced deployment cost). That will either be centralized or decentralized services. As such it seems wise to encourage the latter, as opposed to questioning whether there is any valid block explorer use case.
