I should have stated that we're assuming the actual total hashrate remains constant. Obviously this is not what would actually happen - the rest of the post discusses ways to counter the economic forces at play pushing total hashrate down using only soft forks. The increased variance is still unaccounted for (pool operators would have to deal with this somehow)...and we still have larger block intervals even with compensation. And the practicality of deployment and usability are clearly problematic, to understate things.

It's merely an exercise seeking the theoretical limit of what's actually possible to do with a soft fork.
