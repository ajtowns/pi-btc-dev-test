The most important part that developers should complete is the
"Technical Opinion" column section where they can explain their
general worldview, what their concerns are, how those concerns would
be alleviated. If one is undecided or does not have enough information
regarding each BIP then dont fill it out. That also helps signal the
level of consensus for a proposal.

As it stands at the moment, it's almost impossible to direct someone
at the opinion of a specific developer other than hunting down a few
gems scattered to the four corners of the universe. I tried recently
and it was simply impossible. At least with this system, specific BIPs
aside, we can easily see the view of each developer. I think most of
us can comment on BIP101 since the BIP appears non-negotiable.

The XT faction are easily winning the media war by obscuring rational
debate by high signal to noise ratio. Nicolas' solution means the most
important views expressed by each heavyweight will not get lost and
serve as a good reference point for everyone, including the media.

The site could be extended to include major stakeholders too like
major service providers (think exchanges, wallet providers etc) and
mining pools.
