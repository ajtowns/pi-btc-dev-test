Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Number Request: Addresses over Audio (fixed link)
Message-ID: <CAL9WuQWubcUkj06grc=B_u8ajtOepvFn0DzGBjzVxk8kAgTZVA@mail.gmail.com>

Sorry about the last email, I deleted the repository to get rid of the BIP
number to prevent confusion. The correct address is
https://github.com/Dako300/BIP

This is my BIP idea: a fast, robust, and standardized way for representing
Bitcoin addresses over audio. It takes the binary representation of the
Bitcoin address (little endian), chops that up into 4 or 2 bit chunks
(depending on type, 2 bit only for low quality audio like american
telephone lines), and generates a tone based upon that value. This started
because I wanted an easy way to donate to podcasts that I listen to, and
having a Shazam-esque app (or a media player with this capability) that
gives me an address automatically would be wonderful for both the consumer
and producer. Comes with error correction built into the protocol
