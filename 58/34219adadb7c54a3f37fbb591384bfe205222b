Subject: [Bitcoin-development] separate out blockchain db and wallet to two
	dirs?
Message-ID: <CANg8-dCUC=qEqBSay5VKdqZOwEnx_UxYrT2LbV+20Vb1FbCJ1A@mail.gmail.com>

This idea is from a Debian user [1].

What do you think of moving the > 2 GB db to $HOME/.cache/bitcoin and
leaving the wallet and other config files in $HOME/.bitcoin? This is
so backups can skip the .cache directory and the proposal follows the
freedesktop.org XDG Base Directory Specification [2]. Personal
info/settings stays in .bitcoin/ and everything that can be rebuilt
goes to .cache/bitcoin/ I know users can do a work around and set it
up themselves with symlinks, but interested in what you guys think.

Cheers,
Scott (Debian Developer but new to bitcoin)
