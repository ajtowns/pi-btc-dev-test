I hope you all take a moment to see what DANE leverages with DNSSEC
and SelfSigned x.509 certs. DANE provides the capability for any
entity to associate a self signed certificate with a domain name. This
capability removes the critical path of whitelists and/or Root CA
certs.

Another nifty thing is that it can associate a cert to a domain and a
payment address, if one were to put said address in the DNS :)

Now I am sure the majority of the bitcoin user-base desires anonymity,
but as a merchant I would like to be knowable and wouldn't mind it if
my identity and those of my transactions were "known" and associated
both with my domains and x.509 cert. In most commercial transactions
(which include many of those that leverage invoices) identity is
important, at least for the merchant.
