Apparently that existed already: http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/
But technical people run away from noise while non-technical people
chase them wherever their voices sounds more loud.

One thing that I would like though, is separating Bitcoin
Core-specific development from general bips and consensus discussions.
I know, the bitcoin-consensus mailing list will probably still be
noisy, but at least we will have a non-noisy one and the ability to
say things like "Bitcoin Core's default policy is off-topic in
bitcoin-consensus" in the noisy one...
Also developers of alternative implementations may not be interested
in Bitcoin Core-specific things, so they may want to subscribe to
bitcoin-consensus and unsubscribe from bitcoin-dev.

I already told this to some people and everybody seemed to be positive
about this change, at most sometimes skeptics about the potential
benefits.

Thoughts?
