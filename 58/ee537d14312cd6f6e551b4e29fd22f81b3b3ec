I'm in favor of merging autotools now, unless there are still known issues with
it, such as mingw32 compatibility?

If the Qt port is functionally complete and stable, I'd vote to have it merged as
well under these conditions:
* the changes to the 'core' are minimal/trivial
* marked as 'experimental', and not enabled by default

The only disadvantage of another GUI is that the (necessary) cleanup of RPC/GUI
code will now need makes changes in 3 places instead of 2, but as I understand
it, there are much more people willing to work on Qt code than on wx code?
