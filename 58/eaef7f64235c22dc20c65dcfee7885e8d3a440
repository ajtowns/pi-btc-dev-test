Yes, but no one will ever install a plug in.
And all will update their wallets with the last version, including the auth
protocol.

I perfectly understand all the objections, and they are very good points.

I have at least two wallets enthousiastic about the project so the protocol
will be implemented and it will give some room to experiment.
The BIP came from the idea we should formalize the standard so all wallets
could participate, and it felt more logical to come forward with it.

Maybe a better strategy would be to start "privately" with a few wallets
and services using the protocol, and to come back to the BIP there is
usability and traction.
