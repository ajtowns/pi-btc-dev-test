By "impact" I am referring to the impact on transaction size and thus
blockchain space and fees, not UTXO size as stored by nodes themselves.
Specifically take the size of the txout and txin and compare the version using
P2SH to the equivalent version not using it to get my numbers.

Anyway, given how much uncompressed keys are still used obviously fee pressure
isn't even close to getting people to create efficient transactions.
