Peter,

You did not address me but libbitcoin. Since our story and your evaluation is probably similar, I chime in.

We have seen that the consensus critical code practically extends to Berkley DB limits or OpenSSL laxness, therefore
it is inconceivable that a consensus library is not the same as Bitcoin Core, less its P2P service rules, wallet and RPC server.

The Core code base is unfriendly to feature extensions because of its criticality, legacy design and ancient technology. It is also a commodity
that the ecosystem takes for granted and free. 

I honestly admire the core team that works and progresses within these limits and perception.

I am not willing to work within the core?s legacy technology limits. Does it mean I am dicking around? I think not.
It was my way to go down the rabbit hole by re-digging it and I created successful commercial products on the way.

It is entirely rational for me to focus on innovation that uses the core as a border router for this block chain. 

I am rather thankful for the ideas of the side chains, that enable innovation that is no longer measured on unapologetic compatibility with a given code base, but its services to end user.
