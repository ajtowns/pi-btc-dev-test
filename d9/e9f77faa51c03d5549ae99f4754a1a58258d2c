This seems excellent to me.

I think most developers want to do the right thing when it comes to standards, 
and it is only the inflexibility or ambiguity of a standard that means they 
don't.

This heirarchical method lets every client supply all the information they 
have -- nobody has to make a decision to leave something out.  The internal 
debate they would have "is my gui version more important than my protocol 
engine version?" is unnecessary.
