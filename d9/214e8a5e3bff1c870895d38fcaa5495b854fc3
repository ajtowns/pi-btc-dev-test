However certificate revocation and updates in miners are pain in the ass,
that's why majority of pools (mine including) don't want to play with
that...

Another solution which would have less overhead would be to implement
something akin to what openssh does. The OpenSSH client stores a
certificate fingerprint, which is then verified automatically upon further
connections to the server.

The initial connection needs to be verified manually by the operator,
though.

at connection time, which is a lot harder to maintain than injecting a
client.reconnect. This, combined with your concern about up to date
certs/revokes/etc, is why BFGMiner defaults to TLS without cert checking for
stratum.

Seems to me that it would correctly mitigate the attack mentioned in the
wired article. I am surprised that miners are not worried about losing
their profits, I would personally be quite annoyed.
