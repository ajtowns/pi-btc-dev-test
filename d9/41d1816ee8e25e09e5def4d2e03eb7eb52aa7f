Miner issues are just one thing what came to my mind. What about validating
transactions? How the pool can be sure that miner is running up to date
bitcoind which do full validation of transactions? Not talking that if
every miner takes his own set of transaction, pool need to calculate merkle
root for every submit, to check its correctness.

I don't think it *cannot* be done, it is just extremely hard and there's no
economic motivation for such complication on pool side. Just see current
pools, they are full of security and stability bugs even while using such
trivial protocol like Stratum...
