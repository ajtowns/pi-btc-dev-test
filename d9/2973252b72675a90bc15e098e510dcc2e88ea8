That's a fatal design in Feathercoin, not a mistake all altchains have
done and certainly irrelevant to Bitcoin.

Regtest is a testchain just like testnet2 and testnet3. Testchains are
the only reason why Bitcoin Core supports multiple chains using
CChainParams.

For the payment protocol testchains, sidechains and altcoins are all
quite similar.
But it is fine to just focus on testchains if sidechains and altcoins
are out of scope.
