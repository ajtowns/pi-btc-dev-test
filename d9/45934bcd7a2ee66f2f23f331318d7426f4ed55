Actually, this is unnecessary since github allows editing of files directly
on the site and the it will submit as a pull request. You can even update
by visiting your fork (it creates this automatically and a topic branch)
and make more edits and it will add to your PR. There is basically no
barrier for non techy people to contribute.
