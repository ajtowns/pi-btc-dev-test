Wouldn?t a revealed private key for time locked funds create a race to
spend? I imagine miners who are paying attention would have the advantage
but it would still just be a race.

Would be nice to have the funds destroyed or sent somewhere specific. Like
if somehow the revealed key was actually itself a presigned transaction. Or
perhaps a 32 byte piece of a tx needed to complete it.
