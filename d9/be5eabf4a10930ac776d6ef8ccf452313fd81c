There is a relevant post from Satoshi on this:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=191.msg1585#msg1585

Quote:

"If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some
agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble started,
lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function.

If the hash breakdown came gradually, we could transition to a new hash in
an orderly way.  The software would be programmed to start using a new hash
after a certain block number.  Everyone would have to upgrade by that time.
 The software could save the new hash of all the old blocks to make sure a
different block with the same old hash can't be used."
