Now I'm really confused.

Why would Mike or I have the authority to write a "social contract" to
promise anything about future-Bitcoin?

I thought the only "social contract" was the decentralized one we have
already-- if you don't like something about the code, then don't download
and run it. Or fork it if you're able.

As the person who started this mailing list, I DO feel like I have the
authority to enforce a social contract of "no trolling or flaming or
name-calling" here. I'd very much like to delegate that authority, though;
ideally to some software algorithm that automatically censors topics or
people who don't contribute to a productive discussion.

PS: speaking of productive discussion...
... please change the Subject line when the topic wanders.
