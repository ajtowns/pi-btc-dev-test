Greg,

I added, stripped out, and added analogous musig delinearization 3 times in
response to stuff posted here.  I'm adding it back now. Not sure why my
head is thick around that issue.

The security advantages of a redistributable threshold system are huge.
If a system isn't redistributable, then a single lost or compromised key
results in lost coins... meaning the system is essetntially unusable.

I'm actually worried that Bitcoin releases a multisig that encourages loss.
