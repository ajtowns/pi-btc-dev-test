It is even worse in non-segwit scripts, which is effectively SIGHASH_NOINPUT|SIGHASH_NONE, so any UTXO of the same key could be stolen. (It?s restricted to only one UTXO in segwit, but it?s still like a SIGHASH_NONE.)

I don't see why we should bother to soft fork this out on the basis of
security, given that there are many other ways to insecurely use private keys
(e.g. reused nonces). Maybe soft-fork it out on the basis of code complexity,
but this sounds like a lot of work.

Also, I have to wonder if it's just as likely the devs might think the
non-standardness means it is secure.
