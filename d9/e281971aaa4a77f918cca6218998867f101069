I explained here why pay with difficulty is bad for everyone: miners and 
users, and described the use of OP_CLTV for pay-to-future-miner

However, a general problem of pay-to-increase-block-size scheme is it 
indirectly sets a minimal tx fee, which could be difficult and 
arbitrary, and is against competition
