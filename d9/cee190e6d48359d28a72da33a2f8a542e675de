Well if large pools wanted it would be trivial for all of them to just
connect to each other... but my 25kB/s average data rate sure indicates
that they either aren't bothering, or aren't bothering to do that
correctly.

Which is an awful solution, although probably a correct one.... After
all, if you don't include transactions, you can start mining blocks
earlier too based on just the header.

That's a fundemental misunderstanding; there's no such thing as a min
fee.

As for economies of scale, the "product" we're paying miners for is
decentralization and resistance to 51% attack. If instead only get 51%
attack resistance, we're getting a bum deal. If that's all we're
getting, we don't actually have 51% resistance...
