The energy cost of mining cannot be reduced, nor is it rational to consider it ?too high?.

(I infer that this could be done retroactively, and wave my hands over some of the details since you did not talk about reorgs.)  The same applies as for attacks requiring 33% or 25% of total hashpower.

Imagine for example that there are a total of, let's say, 2^10 available next-coinbase/miners and the algorithm just allow 50% or 2^9 of them to mine, ?how could it be possible that one among them could have 51% of power by chance?

Large miners would have a vast advantage over small miners, insofar as deliberately incrementing N by one more bit could only be done by a miner who creates 2^(N+1) blocks (= 2 * 2^N).  By such means, it may be possible for a very large miner to eventually lock out all other miners altogether, and monopolize all Bitcoin mining.

Let's introduce the concept of "spent" next-coinbase versus "un-spent" one, something like similarly to UTXO. A next-coinbase would only be valid if it has not been previously used to mine a block. Simplifying, with the spent vs unspent a large miner is restricted to a single next-coinbase as anyone else. Being more precise it's allowed a single next-coinbase for each mined new-miner-block mined creating a "thread" of mining blocks for each new new-miner-block. Schematically a thread would look like: 
> new-miner-block:next-coinbase_1 -> mined-block:next-coinbase_2 ->  ... -> (thread expired - see comment below about expiration)
> 
> In this case a large miner A with T times more power than another one B could potentially spent mining power to create T parallel threads for each thread created by miner B. A solution that could fix this issue is to allow a maximum life time for each thread expressed in number of blocks. After a given number of blocks have being mined the miner is forced to create new new-miner-block to continue participating. The algorithm to choose the life-time must be such that if a miner tries to create many parallel threads (many new-miner-block), by the time it start mining transaction blocks the first new-miner-block will start to expire, so he will be punished.

Let's imagine the list of registered non-expired next-coinbase addresses  is 2^10. The consensus checks that for N=1 there is *about* 1/2^N == 1/2 of unspent next-coinbase addresses that match (it must be close to 1/2 of the total 2^10 addresses with maybe an small +/- 1% statistical deviation). Then N=1 will be accepted. Check now for N=2. If there are 1/(2^N) = 1/4 next-coinbase addresses matching then N=2 is accepted. The algorithm continues until some "++N" fails. Initially N=0 and so all miners are welcome to the game. They all will start producing next-coinbase addresses and when there are enough different ones N will become 1, then 2, ... This system will will keep an equilibrium naturally. If new miners stop producing new new-miner-blocks, eventually the threads will expire and N will be automatically be decreased. Miners will act rationally to keep enough threads open in their own interest since that will decrease the electricity bill.

Since it's not expected that many blocks are mined by the same miner in a row (maybe no more than 2 o 3) the "many" number must be for example twice as much as the expected maximum numbers of blocks that a large miner can mine in average.

But you discuss only ?new bitcoins?,which are a diminishing portion of the block reward, and will eventually reach zero.  Coinbase from fees must go somewhere; but under your scheme, a ?new miner? has no payable address.

Is N constrained to be sufficiently short that a match is guaranteed from the existing set, then that makes it trivial for large mining farms to collect addresses and further dominate (or even monopolize) the network in the attack described above.  If it isn?t, then the network could suddenly halt when nobody is allowed to mine the next block; and that would enable *this* attack:

Contra what you say, block hashes can?t be ?considered random?.  Indeed, partial preimage bruteforcing of block hashes is the entire basis of mining POW.

If N be small, then it should be feasible for a large mining farm to eventually register a set of ?next-coinbase? addresses which match any N.  **This increases mining centralization.**  If N be large, then this creates the possibility (or raises the probability) that no address will match, and nobody will be allowed to mine the next block.

The only way to start fresh would be with a prohibitively expensive no-payout block.  Mining can be totally anonymous at present, and must so remain.  Miners are only identified by certain information they choose to put in a block header, which they could choose to change or omit?or by IP address, which is trivially changed and is never a reliable identifier.

The anonymity increases in the sense that miner will consume fewer energy. Electricity bill is the easiest way today to trace miners.

(Allegedly, this is one reason why some big miners occasionally mine empty blocks.)  Though I suppose that difficulty would drop by unspecified means.

And of course, miners that want to save more energy will have to adapt to put their systems on stand-by while they  are not chosen for the next round. I think based on my limited experience with ASIC mining that just by not sending new orders to the miner the power comsumption will decrease dramatically even if the equipment is still on.

To obtain bitcoins he will first need to mine a new-miner-block to enter the game and then an standard block before the thread expires. Notice the expire time/block-length start just after the new-miner-block has been mined so the probabilities to mine before the expiration time will be proportional to its mining power, as for everyone else.
