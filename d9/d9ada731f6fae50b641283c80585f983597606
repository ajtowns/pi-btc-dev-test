I'm going to go with this one, since we are seeking common ground and all of 
this makes sense to me. And I bet to Gavin would agree to this too.

The question I want to ask is this;

How do you expect to get from the current to the situation outlined above?

There are several market forces at work;

* people currently expect near-free payments.
* people currently expect zero-confirmations.
* Bitcoin is seeing a huge amount of uptake, popularity, etc.
* With Greece still in flux, there is a potential enormous spike of usage set 
to come when (not if) the Euro falls.


I conclude that we need;

* to create and make working solutions like LN, sidechains etc etc etc.
This should allow people to get their fast confirmation time. Who cares its of 
a different nature, the point is that the coffeeshop owner lets you leave with 
your coffee. We can sell that.

* To buy ourselves time, LN is not done, Bitpay and friends work on-chain. 
That won't change for a year at least.
We need to move the max-block size to a substantial bigger size to allow 
Bitcoin to grow.


Unfortunately for us all, Bitcoin is over-sold. We don't have a sales 
department but the worth-of-mouth leaves us in a bad situation. And we need to 
react to make sure the product isn't killed by bad publicity. What Gox didn't 
manage can certainly happen when people find out that Bitcoin can't currently 
do any of the things everyone is talking about.
So, while LN is written, rolled out and tested, we need to respond with bigger 
blocks.  8Mb - 8Gb sounds good to me.

Can everyone win?
