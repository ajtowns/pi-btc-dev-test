Looks like much goodness in this version. Thanks for all this work.

Any chance that options to limit the size of blocks and prioritize paid
vs free txes could make it in?

By the way, by far the most common support request I have at my pool is
users withdrawing coins and not seeing it in their wallet because it's
not up-to-date with the block chain. Might be worth adding something in
the bitcoin-qt GUI to make it more obvious that users can't see new
transactions and why.

I just now updated the Norwegian translation on Transifex, if you'd like
to do another pull before the release. For some reason there were many
strings I had already translated that now had no translation and had to
be done again (even ones that had the same English text). Many languages
are now only about 50% translated.

Also there were new duplicated strings:

"Verify a message to ensure it was signed with a specified Bitcoin address"
"Sign a message to prove you own a Bitcoin address"
"Clear &All"

These two seem odd:
Use UPnP to map the listening port (default: 0)
Use UPnP to map the listening port (default: 1 when listening)
