Subject: [Bitcoin-development] "To:" addresses missing

I first thought it was a problem in my UI, after syncing to the latest git
version. But the following screenshot says enough:

The address are also missing in the detailed transaction view. It appears
that the problem is in script.cpp:

        BOOST_FOREACH(PAIRTYPE(opcodetype, valtype)& item, vSolution)
        {
            uint160 hash160;
            if (item.first == OP_PUBKEY)
                addressRet.SetPubKey(item.second);
            else if (item.first == OP_PUBKEYHASH)
                addressRet.SetHash160((uint160)item.second);
            if (keystore == NULL || keystore->HaveKey(addressRet))
                return true;
        }

It will only return "true" on keys that are in the keystore (your own
private keys...). After commenting out the "if (keystore == NULL ..." line,
the display is fixed.

But that simple solution might have impact somewhere else.
