I disagree with this proposal both in spirit and in practice.

We all know satoshi was the best programmer like no one ever was. Clearly he intended this monetary supply from the beginning, who are we but mere mortals to go against satoshi's will?

Also, should we really do this with a soft fork when we can take this opportunity to redesign the whole system with a hard fork? This is out chance to switch to a whole new script engine!
