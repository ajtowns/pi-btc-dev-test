I have heard such theory before, it's a complete mistake to think that
others would run full nodes to protect their business and then yours,
unless it is proven that they are decentralized and independent

Running a full node is trivial and not expensive for people who know how
to do it, even with much bigger blocks, assuming that the full nodes are
still decentralized and that they don't have to fight against big nodes
who would attract the traffic first

I have posted many times here a small proposal, that exactly describes
what is going on now, yes miners are nodes too... it's disturbing to see
that despite of Tera bytes of BIPs, papers, etc the current situation is
happening and that all the supposed decentralized system is biased by
centralization

Do we know what majority controls the 6000 full nodes?
