Thanks a lot for the reply, let me think it over and come up with a proper
response. You and Conrad may be right about the proposal being irrelevant
to DDoS, so I'll try to come up with the more solid argument supporting my
point of view, otherwise, I will refute the proposal myself). At the moment
I feel like I need to specify game theoretical model and consider all costs
and incentives in more details. Sincerely yours, Ilya Eriklintsev.
