Ok. I'll fork on Github. Looking at the source, and some Qt documentation,
it should be doable to do string substitution for both the value and the
unit.

The question is if we should define a new value, that we use solely to
display in this text, or if we should use MIN_TX_FEE or MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE in
some way. What are the dev's thoughts?

I'd like to get some more dev opinions on whether this should even be done
before I go ahead and write the code.
