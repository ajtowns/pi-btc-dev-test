 >It is a common misconception that the core devs govern Bitcoin;

They set standards rather than govern.  It is an important standard, but 
it is a voluntary standard.  How important that standard in terms of 
defining the consensus rules is subject to speculation and the amount of 
influence depends on the specific circumstances. Maybe some wording can 
be changed to reflect that it is a voluntary standard.
