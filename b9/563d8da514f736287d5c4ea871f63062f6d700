Because turning on SSL gives pool operators a way to hack your miners.

Just because SSL is the answer for financial services regulated security
theatre, where fraud means you just roll-back the transaction, it does not
mean it is actually a good cryptographic solution.

There are far better mechanisms that could be implemented using ECDSA 
keys (aka bitcoin addresses) to authenticate both miners and pools, but
the problem is there zero economic incentive to do so. As long as the
BGP/SSL/zero-day-of-the-week man-in-the middle fraud cost is lower than the
engineering cost to do some real cryptography and code audits, we'll keep
having new 'security patches' every couple of months.
