Master keys of 32 bytes would work as-is, as ordinary private keys are also 32 bytes. Secrets of other lengths could be supported if the function that generates a[i] from a[i-1] (which is presently SHA-256) were replaced with a function having parameterized output length, such as scrypt.

Base58Check encodings of shares for secrets of lengths other than 32 bytes would have prefixes other than "SS", but that's not a huge concern. I suspect 32 bytes would be the most common secret length anyway, wouldn't you?
