I don't think Sybil attack is the right term for this.. there is only 
one IP address.. one "identity".

I'm not even sure that this behaviour can be considered abuse.. it's 
pretty much following the rules and maybe even improving the transaction 
and block propagation.

As far as monitoring transaction origins someone could do that using 
lots of different IPs instead of just one (more like an actual Sybil 
attack rather than this non-Sybil attack).. and noone would be making a 
fuss (and imo, probably someone does do that too as it would be useful 
to capture a larger number of inbound connections).
