 malware
Message-ID: <etPan.54d0b945.46e87ccd.7f23@Williams-MBP>

An idea for the bitcoin malware proposal below, the idea is at the bottom?

Using a desktop website and mobile device for 2/3 multisig in lieu of a hardware device (trezor) and desktop website (mytrezor) works, but the key is that the device used to input the two signatures?cannot be in the same band. ?What you are protecting against are MITM attacks. ?The issue is that if a single?device or network is compromised by malware, or if a party is connecting to a counterparty through a channel with compromised security, inputing 2 signatures through the?same device/band defeats?the purpose of 2/3 multisig. ?This is the same as how MITM defeats 2FA via mobile phone if the token is entered into the same website as the password - the token is simply passed through by the attacker to the secure session with the provider, allowing unfettered access or reuse of tokens for transactions other than those intended by the real user.

Companies have?found clever ways around MITM attacks using SSL sniff and derivatives by embedding code in mobile apps that communicate not with the website authenticating the user, but with 3rd party company that authenticates the token and passes the authentication to the website through a different secure channel, making the MITM attack far much more difficult. ?The trick here is that instead of one channel, we now have two channels that must be compromised. ?Also, the second channel is between a security company and a (hopefully) professionally run?financial?services website. ?There are other approaches to defeat MITM, such as fingerprinting pages to detect spoofs. ?The former (secure 3rd party channel) is very secure but requires a trusted third party. ?The latter (fingerprinting) is a crap shoot with very high?false positive rates. ?

Anyway, the exact same principles apply here to this conversation. ?The second signature must be presented from a separate band to maintain a higher?degree of security. ?If one signature occurs via HTTP(s) from application 1, another should be SMS through a carrier network, etc via application 2.

The trick we need to look at is how to use the bitcoin network as a delivery mechanism to bypass the need for the trusted third party in the example above. ?Instead of the second factor routing through a 3rd party to the intended recipient, we have another option - one that doesn?t require core development either.

1) Sender > signs signature 1 via desktop > bitcoin network 2/3 P2SH
2) Mobile app also used by sender receives req. from bitcoin network to sign signature - not through the site in 1 (similar to the 2nd channel between the website and security company above)
3) Sender > signs signature 2 via mobile app (or any separate device?operating on a different network - heck could be radio) > 2/3 signatures,?transaction?authorized

Any wallet service provider can use this model,?all they must do is develop two independent applications?such a secure browser plugin and a website, or a mobile app and a website that use 2/3 multisig to authorize transactions. ?No core development required - just better security design and execution by those developing wallets. ?If the protocol could natively communicate via two?separate?networks, that might be something to consider, but really developers should already?have all the tools they need, assuming they are competent.

If there was a way to perform 2/3 multisig without requiring a second band, performing the function safely by somehow knowing if the service is performed from a compromised device through some sort of on-blockchain anti-malware check by validating the signature of the signing?application by comparing it to a signature recorded when the multisig address was funded, ?that would be a really neat breakthrough. ?Food for thought, but I can?t see how that could be executed in a way where signatures couldn?t be spoofed from a compromised device. ?If someone cracks that problem, it?s a really big advance for information security.

My comments below start out with the presumption of user platform?
compromise, but the same analysis holds for the case where the user?
platform is clean but a web wallet is compromised. Obviously the idea is?
that either or both may be compromised, but integrity is retained as?
long as both are not compromised and in collusion.?

I would like to fix this at some point in any case.?

If we want to do that, we must at least have signatures with too-long?
R or S values as non-standard.?

One way to do that is to just - right now - add a patch to 0.10 to?
make those non-standard. This requires another validation flag, with a?
bunch of switching logic.?

The much simpler alternative is just adding this to BIP66's DERSIG?
right now, which is a one-line change that's obviously softforking. Is?
anyone opposed to doing so at this stage??

No, that's not it. Sorry for not being clear. Independence of control is?
the central issue in the analysis of a multiple factor system. If an?
attack compromises one factor there must be no way for that attack to?
reduce the difficulty of obtaining the other factors.?

Some factors (secrets), like a fingerprint, aren't very secret at all.?
But getting someone's fingerprint doesn't also help the attacker get a?
PIN. That factor must be attacked independently. But if the PIN is?
encrypted with the fingerprint in a public store, then the PIN is not?
independent of the fingerprint and there is really only one secret.?

If multiple factors are coincident (located within the same security?
perimeter) they are compromized coincidentally. Coincidence has the same?
effect as dependence. Consider a credit card with a "security code"?
printed on the back. A successful attack on the leather wallet yields?
both secrets.?

Individual environments can be compromised with some difficulty (e.g.?
desktop malware, fingerprint lift, dictionary attack, brute force PIN,?
etc.). For the sake of simplicity, let that chance of successful?
independent attack on any factor be 1 in 2 and the resulting probability?
of successful concurrent attack on any n factors be 1 in 2^n. If m?
factors are dependent/coincident on others the relation becomes 1 in?
2^(n-m).?

Any multi-factor web wallet that handles the user's keys in the browser?
and authenticates the user in the browser to authorize service signing?
is effectively single factor. One attack may be launched by an insider,?
or externally, against the web app, executing in the browser, gaining?
coincident access to two secrets. Browser/desktop malware can accomplish?
the same. The difficulty is 1 in 2 vs. the expected 1 in 4.?

I'm not questioning the motive, I agree it's worth trying. But trying is?
not succeeding. Increasing user (and/or system) complexity without?
increasing integrity or privacy is a poor trade, and worse if the user?
is misled.?
