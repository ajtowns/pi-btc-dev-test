As an interested party not intimately familiar with the bitcoin codebase
who also spent some time setting up a node a while ago, I would like to
add one thing to the above list - network rate limiting.
When I first set up my node, I did not consider this until it started
eating all of my upstream bandwith (on an ADSL line that isn't so fun),
and I must admit I was a bit disappointed when I found that I would have
to set this up separately. An option to limit the upstream and
downstream network usage (like what tor or most torrent clients does)
would be useful.

On the note of the distro packages, I've so far been pretty happy with
the packages provided by Arch Linux - I have no idea if they build it
correctly (with the correct static libs and all), but it seems to work
fine for the edge router case.
