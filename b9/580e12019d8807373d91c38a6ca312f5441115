Subject: [Bitcoin-development] bitcoind as a library
Message-ID: <CAKzHBKnFHnc5+b0kU9=a0iG3HCU=mwx71DbQPk53Y91aPhA7eA@mail.gmail.com>

Two minor observations:

DecodeBase58Check is listed as inline, but isnt actually inlined in the
header.
This makes it both non-present in libbitcoin_common.a and unavailable
to other code that would use libbitcoin_common.a as a library. (bug?)

In general, the hierarchy of tools is poor/weak. for example base58.h could
be a fairly
independent low level math/string library, but it includes caddress, which
requires chainparams, and makes the whole dependency tree quite involved...


Is there an intention that the various internal libraries could/should
be strengthened and heirachicalized such that they would be suitable for
3rd party development of bitcoin related services and tools, or is that not
a goal, and some other project would have to fill such a role ?
