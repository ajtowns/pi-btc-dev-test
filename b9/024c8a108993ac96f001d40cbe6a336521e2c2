(4) is a nice idea.

I was hoping to avoid (3) simply because for any one of these upgrades
hopefully 95% of the network is neutral wrt the change because they
won't mine either form of the transactions.

The active statement has the benefit that it constitutes a proof: You
know with specific confidence (based on the window size) how likely a
fork of length X will be if a newly invalid transaction is announced
at the time of the activation.
