That can be done as a separate proposal, it's not mutually exclusive
to this one for those who intend to run BIP148.

I disagree that it should be only run by miners, enforcement of
segsignal mandatory signalling by economic nodes strongly discourages
any false signaling.

Those who can should still upgrade for segsignal, the more that
upgrade ahead of activation the more secure it is. Those who don't
upgrade would want to wait for more confirmations anyways. I didn't
think a lock in period was all that good an idea here due to the
fairly short deployment timeline.
