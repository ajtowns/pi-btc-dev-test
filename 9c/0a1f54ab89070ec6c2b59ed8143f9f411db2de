Subject: [Bitcoin-development] New BIP: protocol for multisignature payments
Message-ID: <1422667849.25602.6.camel@TARDIS>

Hello,

I've been thinking about how to solve security problems of the servers
holding huge amounts of bitcoins (exchanges, markets...) and came up
with this idea: https://gist.github.com/Kixunil/2ec79cf40a53fb899ac5

TL;DR: it's extension of BIP70 (but not fully compatible due to security
reasons) which supports making of multisig transactions dynamically.
(The most important thing is that the user provides his address.)

What do you think? Is it a good way to solve the problem or do you know
about something better? I would really like this or something similar
implemented by wallets.

Thank you for your feedback!

Martin
