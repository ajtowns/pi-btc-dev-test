Subject: [Bitcoin-development] txtool: Advanced transaction building and fun
Message-ID: <CAJHLa0PkRV+Jh6ZvPGuvOUwZc-=4LjS0ONT8h3VAESvF33s28A@mail.gmail.com>

txtool is a command line tool written in node.js that interfaces with
Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind, to automate or assist in building interesting,
unusual, complicated or just plain odd transactions.  The goal is to
demonstrate advanced bitcoin features, and make it easier for users to
experiment.  The intended audience has a basic awareness of how
bitcoin transactions look and work.

The theory of operation and full list of commands may be reviewed at
https://github.com/jgarzik/txtool/blob/master/README

Initially, two working examples are presented:
* Easy multi-signature transaction building:
https://github.com/jgarzik/txtool/blob/master/examples/multisig.txt
(similar to gmaxwell's P2SH multisig example)
* Passing around transactions (possibly multi-signature) for signing:
https://github.com/jgarzik/txtool/blob/master/examples/tx-signing.txt

Further examples such as decentralized crowdfunding and atomic coin
swapping* will be demonstrated soon.
