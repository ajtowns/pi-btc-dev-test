Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Update alert false positives
Message-ID: <5352EBDF.2090504@olivere.de>

Hello,

bitcoin-qt produces on many systems an unnecessary alert:

"URGENT: Upgrade required: see https://www.bitcoin.org/heartbleed"

Especially the stable channel is affected:

https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/bitcoin

This is a bit frightening for normal users. I think the best would be to
turn off this message (if possible). It produces too many false
positives and motivates people to maybe harmful workarounds.
