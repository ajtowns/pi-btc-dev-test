How do you know who is who online? If Alice and Bob want to transact and
haven't exchanged keys before they need public-key infrastructure
out-of-band to identify themselves. Which means they are using SSL and
Certificate authorities and trust them. If you have non-cooperative hubs
they could flood the network and make it unusable. And why should hubs
cooperate? There are no incentives in the system.
