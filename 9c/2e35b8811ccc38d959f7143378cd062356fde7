This is a very important point and a huge step forward in my opinion.

The downside of MIT/BSD licenses is that companies can take and not give 
back. It doesn't build a community and commonly-shared property. Copyleft 
allows people to take and embrace, but if they extend they have to give 
back. Which is fair, you build it on their stuff...
