Hmm, git repositories don't quite work like that. Instead, you should
imagine everyone having a local copy of the git repository. Each
developer synchronizes their git repository with other developers.
They merge changes from specific remote branches that they have
received. Each developer has their own branch and each developer is
the "single decision maker" for the artifact that they compile.
