Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Script Parser
Message-ID: <b0f3fed804a283f654a1cbc5df87ec2e.squirrel@mail.fairluck.net>

Hello,

I've notice that OP_1NEGATE cannot be parsed with the function ParseScript
in core_read.cpp, this op makes the flow reach line 88 -> throw
runtime_error("script parse error");

This is likely a bug, is it?
Thanks

M

PS: I am working with version 0.12.1
