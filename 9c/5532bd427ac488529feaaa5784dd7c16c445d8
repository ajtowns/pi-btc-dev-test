I also would prefer to go straight to uBTC as the "standard wallet unit".
 It works out perfectly with Satoshi's being the decimal units.  Something
that costs $10USD would be 25000uBTC.  This isn't a problem for a place
like South Korea, where 10USD is about 10,000 Won, so we aren't even off on
a scale of usable currencies in major economies.

The downsides are obviously confusion (causing mistakes resulting in lost
coins), and possibly from a psychological perspective on price (uBTC are
worthless!).  On the other hand, it also might help people feel like they
are getting in on the ground floor still (I own 100,000 uBTC!), and reduce
the perception the Bitcoins are not divisible (I have heard several people
worry that 21 million is not enough units).

Alan's ideas for compatibility with multiple fields will also be helpful to
solving the confusion issue.
