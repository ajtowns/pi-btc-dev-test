I think many of us who think about human - computer interactions see the
need for a well defined process to roll back unexpected behavior in a computer
system. My 2014 era proposal is https://bitbucket.org/tmagik/catoshi/issues/24

The fundamental assumption around cryptocoins is you have a secret (private
key) known only by you. Currently in bitcoin if that assumption changes, the
response is blame the user. 'Incompetence, etc, etc'

This is bad business. For any cryptocurrency to really get mass market, we
need to provide our users with key revocation, to be used when the assumption
about being the only holder of a secret is broken.

I think there's a hardfork-worthy choice here:

1) implement reversal/revocation as an add-on feature
2) implement reversal/revocation as a fundamental that every address gets.

Ethereum made a quick hardfork choice to reverse a *single* instance of
unexpected behavior, and looks a lot like a bank bailout. We have the chance
to learn from this mistake, and, apparently, make a lot of money trading
on both sides of the hardfork.
