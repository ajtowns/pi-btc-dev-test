That conversation missed a second issue. Namely that there is no way to punish people if there is a double spend in a micro block that happens in key block which reorg'd away the first transaction. eg one miner mines a transaction in a micro block, another miner (either by not having seen the first yet, or being malicious - potentially the same miner) mines a key block which reorgs away the first micro block and then, in their first micro block, mines a double spend. This can happen at any time, so you end up having to fall back to regular full blocks for confirmation times :(.

Also, Greg Slepak brought up a good point on twitter at https://twitter.com/taoeffect/status/654358023138209792. Noting that this model means users could no longer pick transactions in a mining pool which was set up in such a way (it could be tweaked to do so with separate rewards and pubkeys, but now the user can commit fraud at a much lower cost - their own pool reward, not the block's total reward).
