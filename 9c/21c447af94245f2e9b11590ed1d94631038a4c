I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but right now you can make an
arbitrary chain of challenges, and the BIP includes methods for
determining an approximate time to solve (nodes will, at the very
least, discard any challenge which will on average take longer time to
solve than the expiration of the challenge itself, for example, i.e.
the "nope too hard" part).

Others mentioned this approach. I haven't given it much thought.
Admittedly it would be an effective way to prevent DoS but it also has
some unwanted side effects that need to be cleared up (e.g. in a
no-gains scenario like the BIP proposes, the node requesting PoW done
doesn't *gain* anything from lying to the node performing the work).
