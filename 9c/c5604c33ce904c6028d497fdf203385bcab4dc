+1 for deploying BIP65 immediately without further waiting. Agree with 
all Peter's points.

If BIP65 has to follow the 0.12 schedule, it will take almost 9 months 
from now to complete the softfork. I don't see any good reason to wait 
for that long. We have too much talk, too little action.

Some mining pools hinted that they may adopt BitcoinXT at the end of 
2015. If we could start deploying BIP65 earlier, they will have a 
patched version by the time they switch. Gavin has agreed to support 
BIP65 in XT.

By the way, is there any chance to backport it to 0.9? In the deployment 
of BIP66 some miners requested a backport to 0.9 and that's why we have 
0.9.5.
