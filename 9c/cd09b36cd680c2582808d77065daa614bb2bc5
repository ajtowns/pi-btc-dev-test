There have been a number of similar (identical?) proposals over the years, some were discussed in these threads:

There is however a way to circumvent that problem. That is to create a special account called the ?Genesis Account?, this account?s Private Key and Public Key will be available to everyone.<BR>

That is where the Genesis account comes in. All funds in the Exodus Block will show as though they originated and were sent from the Genesis Account using its privatekey to generate each transaction.<BR>

> Now the next problem is that the number of Bitcoins keeps expanding and so the funds in the Genesis Account need to expand as well. That can be done by showing as though this account is the account which is mining the coins, and it will be the only account in the Exodus Block which ?mines? the coins, and receives the mining bonus. In the Exodus Block all coins mined by the real miners will show as though they were mined by Genesis and sent to the miners through a regular transaction.
