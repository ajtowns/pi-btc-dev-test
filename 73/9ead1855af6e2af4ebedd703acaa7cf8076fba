Just a point about terminology:

Roadmap - A plan of proposed changed used to meet some sort of goal.  If 
the goal is increased scaling then you list a series of changes that 
need to be done to achieve that goal.

Baseline - That is the "If We Do Nothing" Analysis.  Each proposed 
change will generally have one or more alternatives which are compared 
to the "baseline."

those would be 2 different documents.
