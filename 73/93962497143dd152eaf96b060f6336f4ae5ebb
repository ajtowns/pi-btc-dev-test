Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Question regarding Confidential Transactions
Message-ID: <20160209131215.GE2329@banane.informatik.uni-ulm.de>

Hi all,

I am trying to fully grasp confidential transactions.

When a sender creates a confidential transaction and picks the blinding
values correctly, anyone can check that the transaction is valid. It
remains publically verifiable.
But how can the receiver of the transaction check which amount was
sent to him?
I think he needs to learn the blinding factor to reveal the commit
somehow off-chain. Am I correct with this assumption?
If yes, how does this work?

All the best
Henning
