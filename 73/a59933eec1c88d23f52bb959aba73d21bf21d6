I suggest running it in valgrind with --leak-check=full for 10 minutes.

  valgrind --leak-check=full src/bitcoind 2>&1 | tee out

This at least will show you any memory leaks at exit.
Naturally, the leaks you observe may just be design issues where cache can 
grow to much and when the cache is cleaned on shutdown you won't see it in the 
valgrind output.
