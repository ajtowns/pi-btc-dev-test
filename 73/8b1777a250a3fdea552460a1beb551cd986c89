Huh?

So in the future lets suppose we schedule a change to the acceptable
block rules that allows more SigOps in a block, or allows generation
transaction to be spent before 100 confirmations. At that same time,
the DoS rules will be changed.

You cannot "legitimately" relay those blocks without a scheduled
block-chain-split.  If a block-chain-split IS scheduled and the rules
change, then denying service to nodes running old, obsolete versions
of bitcoin is the right thing to do-- it is better to "fail hard" and
find it difficult or impossible to connect to the network rather than
continue with an obsolete client and a non-majority block chain.

(and the third DoS in AcceptBlock(): prev block not found  is a
"should be impossible" case, because AcceptBlock is only called when
extending the best-block chain).
