out any hardware. If the latter one is suspected to lead to the permanent
existence of two chains then a hardfork that forks out hardware is even
more likely to do so (I claim it's guaranteed).

You are wrong. Whether 2 chains survive in parallel or not depends SOLELY
in whether both chains maintain demand (aka users).
Anyway, this is a discussion I had with Gavin and Rusty on bitcoin-discuss
already. I suggest we move this particular point there since it is more
philosophical than technical.
