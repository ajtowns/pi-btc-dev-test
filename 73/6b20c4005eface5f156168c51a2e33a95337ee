Precisely. And since the target of this BIP is generally storage wallets
(just like BIP 0038), we figured these were reasonable time scales for
encryption/decryption on slow devices.

Let's say you're implementing a Raspberry Pi based cold wallet printer.
Having the user wait 10 seconds to several minutes is not unreasonable for
a one-time activity, especially when at least this much time is used to
generate entropy, print the wallet, etc.

The same goes for phones. If you're importing a heavily encrypted wallet
into your device, the user won't mind waiting a few seconds or even a few
minutes.

Plus, as an added bonus, the amount of time it will take to encrypt/decrypt
is highly deterministic, so it's easy to add a nice progress bar to a UI.
