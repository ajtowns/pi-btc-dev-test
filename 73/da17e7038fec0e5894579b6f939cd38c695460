Levin, it is a complicated issue for which there isn't an easy answer. Part
of the issue is that "block size" doesn't actually measure resource usage
very reliably. It is possible to support a much higher volume of typical
usage transactions than transactions specifically constructed to cause DoS
issues. But if "block size" is the knob being tweaked, then you must design
for the DoS worst case, not the average/expected use case.

Additionally, there is an issue of time horizons and what presumed
improvements are made to the client. Bitcoin Core today can barely handle
1MB blocks, but that's an engineering limitation. So are we assuming fixes
that aren't actually deployed yet? Should we raise the block size before
that work is tested and its performance characteristics validated?

It's a complicated issue without easy answers, and that's why you're not
seeing straightforward statements of "2MB", "8MB", or "20MB" from most of
the developers.

But that's not to say that people aren't doing anything. There is a
workshop being organized for September 12-13th that will cover much of
these "it's complicated" issues. There will be a follow-on workshop in the
Nov/Dec timeframe in which specific proposals will be discussed. I
encourage you to participate:
