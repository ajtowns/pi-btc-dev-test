I'm not sure it's a good idea to let other code into the main wallet-handling 
process/memory space. I'd suggest looking into designing a workable Wallet 
Protocol for general use between the wallet and GUIs/applications.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_protocol has a draft I made a long time ago, 
but really seems a bit overcomplicated.
