I am in favor of a more gradual (longer) period and a softforking
solution... that is, more than 30 days of grace period (some period
between 60 days and a year), ...

... and given the number of valid softforking proposals out there it
seems to me that it would be rather simple to see one or more (e.g.
Cameron Garnham's dynamic block size adjustment (needing soft fork
only)) in a BIP.

It is also worthwhile to add that some of the softforking proposals,
and I believe Garnham's to be one of them, are not incompatible with
proposals such as Jeff Garzik's BIP 100, that is to say, there is
nothing keeping you from doing the Garnham dynamic block size
adjustment (softfork) right now today, examining its progress and
effect, while also preparing for a Garzik (BIP 100) for example.
