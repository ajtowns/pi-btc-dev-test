To be clear, *none* of the previous (U)TXO commitment schemes require *miners*
to participate in generating a commitment. While that was previously thought to
be true by many, I've seen no counter-arguments to the argument I published I
few months ago(1) that (U)TXO commitments did not require a soft-fork to
deploy.
