I never measured exactly, but Bitcoin Wallet takes about an hour to
update its blockchain initially on good WLAN (lightweight approach,
headers only).

After that, Bitcoin Wallet is just as fast as any other client.

The advantage of that approach is that you are not dependent on any
server (like Spinner or Electrum). Essentially you're carrying the
blockchain in your pocket.

Cheers,
