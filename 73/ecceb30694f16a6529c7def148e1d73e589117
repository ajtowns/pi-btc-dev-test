Yes - that is the reason why a discussion list is being created, as an
outlet for off-topic discussions.  The consensus of the developers that
created this bitcoin-dev list a short time ago is of being turned off due
to the off-topic noise, impacting productivity.

Since 2011 and bitcoin-development, the list was always intended to focus
on the highly technical bits of the core software, and avoid wandering into
never-ending philosophical discussions.  Example:
