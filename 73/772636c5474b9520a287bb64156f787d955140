No, I think 1 MB is just as arbitrary as any other size proposed.
All I want is for consensus change proponents to try harder to
convince other users (including me)

No, if the changed rule only serves to limit centralization, then how
that limitation to centralization is affected should be the first
thing to consider.
If miners' concern was only the amount of profit they make they
wouldn't mine free transactions already.
You cannot possibly know what all users' are concern about, so I will
just ignore any further claim in that direction.
Talk for yourself: your arguments won't be more reasonable just
because you claim that all users think like you do.

I disagree with this wild prediction as well.

And I assume the way that vaguely defined "economic majority"
communicates with you through a crystal ball or something

No more, but not less either.
Nobody can't control the implementation that I (or other people
concerned with centralization) run either.

How is allowing fees from rising above zero "fighting the market"?
The system is currently designed with a 1 MB limit. I don't think
that's sacred or anything, but I really don't feel like I'm fighting
"the market" or "the way the system is designed".
In any case, what do "the market" and "the way the system is designed"
have to do with what the majority have been told it's best (which you
seem to think should be a source of truth for some reason I'm still
missing)?

Why 9 MB is safe but 10 MB isn't?
The "conflict" won't be resolved by evading hard questions...

Will there ever be a debate that results in "further blocksize
increases at this point are very risky for mining centralization"?
How will we tell then? Can't we use the same criteria now?
