OK, pull request seems good.

FYI we lost money on last year's conference, and are hoping to break even this year. The only people to make profit will be nefario and anyone else we give a share in it (people who help realise it). Otherwise money made goes towards next year's conference and paying for things to make a better conference (like Gavin wanted to attend but couldn't afford a ticket). It is not a commercial event, and I've been pushing to keep the sponsorship and community parts highly separated. Like I really do not wish to sell a speaker slot, but if I have to (to pay the bills) then it will be obvious due to scheduling and disclaimers that speakers are sponsors.

IMO, bitcoin.org is more community-focussed anyway.
How often do devs use the site, compared to GitHub etc?

Someone else made a pullreq for Bitcoin Magazine; I suggest(ed) that
for-profit organizations should be asked to pitch in some way or another.
Who should organize that, I don't know. If Bitcoin Consultancy/Amir is behind 
the conference, I suggest their/his development contributions should be 
sufficient in that respect.

I concur, this should be discussed in a pullreq.
