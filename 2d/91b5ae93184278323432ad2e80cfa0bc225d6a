???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
I mean lazy and passive ones I addressed. Not the one actively chose whichever solution they like. Users always have their solution. There?s no way to force a union if they are not together.

???????????????????????? BIP ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Yes, users always have choice that they can abandon the nodes. This BIP does?t go against them. I mean only the one(especially wallets) that?s passive, they need to know there?s a choice and pick one.

?? BIP ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
This BIP can be applied to almost any upgrade, including Segwit, Segwit2x, 2m, ec, 8m? but the upgrade is not the key point.

????????????????
Did the users have any real choice?

????????????????????????????????????????????
I don?t see the reason they trust the majority miners(as they do today) but refuse the vote for upcoming protocol upgrade.

??????????????????????????????????????????
This choice for wallet users right now, is wether to follow the 51% majority miners. If they don?t, they can have their fork that get rid of miners.

???????????????????????????????
If they do trust the majority miners, they stay and follow the vote for upcoming protocol upgrade.

??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
So the questions is: Do the bitcoin developers, users, holders, service provides, even miners, (still) have faith in the majority of miners as designed in the white paper?

I personally take that as VETO to current version. This BIP also address this situation. Did you notice that miners should be upgraded first? Did that solve the problem you mentioned above?

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
If we can use this method to at least make miners upgraded to the same consensus version and start to vote for the upcoming changes, that would solve the problem for the passive behavior. Unless the vote miners wish to hold, is not in the wishlist of someone.

I think the divergency is from the different definition of bitcoin. If no common understanding, let?s get one from the white paper, together.
