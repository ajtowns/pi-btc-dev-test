What is required to spend bitcoin is that input be provided to the UTXO
script that causes it to return true.  What Chris is proposing breaks the
programmatic nature of the requirement, replacing it with a requirement
that the secret be known.  Granted, the secret is the only requirement in
most cases, but there is no built-in assumption that the script always
requires only that secret.

This idea could be applied by having the wildcard signature apply to all
UTXOs that are of a standard form and paid to a particular address, and be
a signature of some kind of message to that effect.  I imagine the cost of
re-scanning the UTXO set to find them all would justify a special extra
mining fee for any transaction that used this opcode.

Please be blunt about any of my own misunderstandings that this email makes
clear.
