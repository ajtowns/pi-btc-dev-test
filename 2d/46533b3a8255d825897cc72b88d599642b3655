Almost certainly is not certainly. Hash collisions happen because of chance.

BIP30 is quite explicit:

> "Fully-spent transactions are allowed to be duplicated in order not to
hinder pruning at some point in the future. Not allowing any transaction
to be duplicated would require evidence to be kept for each transaction
ever made."

BIP34 motivations:

> "2. Enforce block and transaction uniqueness, and assist unconnected
block validation."

But it only specifies making collisions harder, not impossible (i.e.
explicitly rejected by consensus).

Are you proposing that we draft a new BIP that allows us all to not have
to code for this? If we do so it will be impossible to guard against a
chain split due to pruning, but you seem to think that's unimportant.
