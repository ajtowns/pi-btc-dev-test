The term 'pruning', unfortunately is very much overused and overloaded in the
bitcoin ecosystem. Satoshi's paper refers to UTXO pruning. This is Pieter Wuille's "ultraprune",
which has been part of Bitcoin Core for more than three years.

Block pruning is not mentioned in that paper because it is just administrative,
the only reason that nodes store historical blocks at all is to serve it to other nodes,
as well as to catch up the wallet status and for -reindexes.

I don't have time to work on the release notes right now, but if someone else
wants to contribute that'd be awesome.

To give a quotum. The point is that the user can choose how much harddisk space they want to
dedicate to block storage.

Block data that is stored can be used by other software, or potentially be
served to other nodes. The latter is not implemented at the moment - it would require
a change to the P2P protocol, thus right now pruning nodes don't serve block
data at all.

There is no security compromise with pruning. Any value of N is intended to be safe.

Very low values would delete undo data that may be necessary in a reorganization,
but this is prohibited by argument checks.

Release notes are not meant as a replacement or supplement for documentation.
The documentation for -prune is this:

  -prune=<n>
       Reduce storage requirements by pruning (deleting) old blocks. This mode
       is incompatible with -txindex and -rescan. Warning: Reverting this
       setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default: 0 =
       disable pruning blocks, >550 = target size in MiB to use for block
       files)

> - maybe mention if there is a "auto" setting for N to ensure that it choses a 
> safe value on its own?

As said, there is no safe or unsafe value. The lowest acceptable value is just as safe
as storing everything.
