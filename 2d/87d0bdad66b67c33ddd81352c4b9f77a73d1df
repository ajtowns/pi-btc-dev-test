I am surprised nothing like this exists already, so am all for the idea.

Maybe I am misunderstanding, but I'm not sure you want to have
thousand separators and other locale stuff in there. All currencies
including USD are often shown in Swedish using space or dot as
thousand separator and comma as decimal separator, e.g. "1.234,56 USD"
or "1 234,56 USD". I.e. this is something that the locale of the
user's environment defines, not something the server should have
opinions about. It is also not ideal to propose a given format based
on the user's locale, as some users have preferences for this (I
personally use US locale for numbers, and a US person who is visiting
Sweden wouldn't want this to suddenly change).

-Kalle.
