Indeed, we agree that BIPs should be licensed as permissive as
possible. Still, I wonder why you chose otherwise with BIP 134.
(Currently OPL and CC-BY-SA)

Licenses that only require attribution are generally compatible with
each other. I don't think we should pick one and only promote/endorse
this one. Let's just leave the decision to the BIP author.

I am pretty sure this is required to host the current text of BIP 2 in
the repo, as currently BIP 1 still applies and still requires for all
BIPs either OPL or PD, which is one of the reasons I think we should
move forward with BIP 2 or amending BIP 1.

BIP 2 does not forbid you to release your work under PD in
legislations where this is possible. None of the licenses mentioned in
BIP 2 is exclusive, so you can choose as many options as you like. One
of the goals of BIP 2 is to no longer allow PD as the only copyright
option.

Luke is the BIP champion of BIP 2, so please cc him if you have
suggestions on how to improve the process of gathering community
consensus.
