Hey Laszlo,

We're just wanting to make sure that it's ok to include your Info.plist and BitcoinAppIcon.icns into the upstream source repository so that osx build can be automated without needing external source requirements (outside of lib deps).

Is this licensed under MIT or similar or would you be willing to put it in the Public Domain or other compatible license.
