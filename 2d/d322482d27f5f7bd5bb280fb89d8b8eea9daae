This essay is old but still relevant, I think:

  http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html

Despite that, there are efforts to write a fresh implementation. For
example, BitCoinJ:

  http://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/

It is not a complete implementation. It's targeting the "simplified
payment verification" mode as a first base, and is mostly intended for
mobile phones today as that's a niche the current codebase can't meet.
In the (very) long run, it may evolve into a full node.

The code was written by Satoshi who is long gone, and I doubt he would
care much for this type of list anyway. He was a do-er rather than a
talker.
