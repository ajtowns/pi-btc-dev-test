Hi guys.

So, as I mentioned on the bitcointalk.org forums thread about the
foundation, I want to get involved in the QA side of bitcoin
development. I've done functional testing in the video game industry for
years. I've read all the messages in this thread, but I'm left unclear how
I can most effectively and quickly being helping out. Could I get a bit of
a directional nudge?

Arklan
