Since the sidechain has the sidechain BMM headers that they want the LD
(bribe) data for, I think that they could specifically request LD data
relevant only to that sidechain by providing a list of hashes to the
mainchain, and the mainchain can return a list of boolean values telling
the sidechain if the LD data exists. That way the data never even has to
go over the network, just a verification that it exists on the mainchain
and we can drop the sidechain_id from the script.

Agreed, we need that.

No, OP_BRIBE (the old version) didn't care about the block height. Where
the blockheight was relevant is when bribe data is added to LD. In order
to be added to LD, the bribe needed to either be a fork (block height
less than the sidechain tip height) or extending the current side-chain
(block height = sidechain tip height + 1). The goal of this was to allow
for reorgs, and also make it so that people cannot skip forward (which
would never be valid so it's a waste of time and space) so that the
sidechain makes progress. With the new design that we have been talking
about, I think that we will need to drop this requirement from the
mainchain, and have the sidechain handle filtering out invalid LD data /
only requesting the verification of LD data that they know to be valid
as far as chain order goes.

Agreed. It might be helpful if you outlined the idea you had on IRC to
the mailing list.

I might be wrong but I thought that OP_RETURN outputs do not go into the
UTXO set. Anyone else want to chime in?
