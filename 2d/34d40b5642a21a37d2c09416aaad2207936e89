Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP49 Derivation scheme changes
Message-ID: <CABuOfuiz9U=ZPWRUfVXHgBekZ74B4zkUikg6Svxbr6jrJA5Vyw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Thanks Thomas. The procedure described in
http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/seedphrase.html is really what I was
looking for ! I really don't see any point of following BIP49, If possible
it would be great if you can propose an alternative to BIP49 that follows
similar structure to what is used in electrum.

I have proposed following changes to BIP32 serialization format
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#serialization-format
to differentiate segwit xpub/xprv. Below the list of new version bytes,
resulting base58 prefix and network type:

0x042393df ,  sxpr ,   segwit mainnet private key
0x04239377 , sxpb , segwit mainnet public key
0x04222463 , stpb ,  segwit testnet public key
0x042224cc ,  stpr ,  segwit testnet private key

Let me know your thoughts
