Sigh. There is *no governance at all*. Any such a BIP like this needs to 
document the natural forces involved in real-world acceptance, not try to lay 
down "rules" that people are expected to follow.

For hardforks, that means economic consensus. For softforks, miner majority. 
For basically anything else, real-world implementation and use (by any 
significant quantity of people).
