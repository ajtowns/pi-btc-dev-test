Could this risk mitigation measure be an optional flag?  And if so,
could it+BIP91 signal on a different bit than bit4?

The reason being, if for some reason the segwit2x activation cannot
take place in time, it would be preferable for miners to have a more
standard approach to activation that requires stronger consensus and
may be more forgiving than BIP148.  If the segwit2x activation is on
time to cooperate with BIP148, it could be signaled through the
non-bit4 approach and everything could go smoothly.  Thoughts on that
idea?  It may add more complexity and more developer time, but may
also address your concerns among others.

The concern I'm raising is more about the psychology of giving BIP148
a sense of safety that may not be valid.  Without several more steps,
BIP148 is definitely on track to be a risky chainsplit, and without
segwit2x it will almost certainly be a small minority chain. (Unless
the segwit2x compromise falls apart before then, and even in that case
it is likely to be a minority chain)
