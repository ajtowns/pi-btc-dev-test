Certificate validation isn't needed unless the attacker can do a direct MITM 
at connection time, which is a lot harder to maintain than injecting a 
client.reconnect. This, combined with your concern about up to date 
certs/revokes/etc, is why BFGMiner defaults to TLS without cert checking for 
stratum.
