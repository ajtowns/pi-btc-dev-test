Hi

To give a critical viewpoint on a such API:

Such APIs usually result in central validation, meaning that users trust API services rather the validating their own data. It break some of the fundamental properties of Bitcoin (avoid trusted third parties).
Systems or applications depending on a full indexed blockchain (a thus such API) do usually scale pretty bad.

I?d like to hear some concrete use-cases for a such block explorer(ish) API.

Thanks
?

I am proposing a unified method of finding/quering the blockchain data with a standardized template containing minimal information about the actual mined block or transaction yet satify the need of what I want to query.
