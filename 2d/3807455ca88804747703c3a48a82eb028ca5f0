You misunderstand what I am saying.  I am not saying I have a specific 
process that should be followed, I am saying that whatever the process 
is then it should be formalized or at least written down.  That way the 
stakeholders have something to work with and keeps people on track.  
Since some people are saying they don't really know what the process is 
the first step would be to describe the current process.  I don't fully 
understand the current process but I can see it is not formalized and 
nobody can even give me a clear description of what it is.  Once you 
have it written down then changes/improvements can be proposed.

The first baby step was already done by the Foundation in developing 
that risk study.   A NIST guide for developing such a document is at 
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30-rev1/sp800_30_r1.pdf. 
No one person can come up with this and it would take buy in from 
several different people who have expertise in specific technical areas 
as well as experts in coming up with test plans.  I recently suggested 
to the people running the MIT lab that they look into developing a 
program along those lines.  Gavin also recently suggested that list of 
Bitcoin metrics be developed to help resolve the current disputes.  I 
can help develop this process if there is interest.

It is not specifically adapted to Bitcoin, and doesn't make a distinction between for example, consensus changes and non-consensus changes.
