I don't support this, unless all other chain-forking-needed changes are made 
at the same time. I do point out that changing the time rules *does not help*.

The rest don't generate rewards immediately as the same block being mined. 
They either eat the loss of invalid blocks, or wait for 100+ confirmations 
before paying. Also, restricting the time rules basically breaks miners 
without rollntime support (such as Phoenix).
