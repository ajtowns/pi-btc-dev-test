BIP70 requests can be sent over bluetooth as well, as can transactions.
Bitcoin Wallet can already send money even when offline by doing this. It's
transparent to the user. I mean original Bluetooth in this context - BLE
has incredibly tight data constraints and isn't really meant for data
transfer.

Yes Android Beam has a pretty stupid UI. You can actually tap the devices,
take them away and then press, but that's not obvious at all. There have
been new APIs added in recent releases that give more control over this, so
it's possible we can revisit things and make the UI better these days.

The donation to live performer example is good - there's no issue of
accidentally paying for someone else in this context as there's only one
recipient, but many senders.

The issue of confused payments remains in other situations though.

For the coffee shop use case, it'd be nicer (I think) if we aim for a
Square-style UI where the device broadcasts a (link to) a photo of the user
combined with a bluetooth MAC. Then the merchant tablet can show faces of
people in the shop, and can push a payment request to the users device.
That device can then buzz the user, show a confirmation screen, put
something on their smart watch etc or just auto-authorise the payment
because the BIP70 signature is from a trusted merchant. User never even
needs to touch their phone at all.
