You are leaving a lot of bytes on the table.

The bits field can only change every 2016 blocks (4 bytes per header),
the timestamp can not be less than the median of the last 11 and is
usually only a small amount over the last one (saves 2 bytes per
header), the block version is usually one of the last few (save 3
bytes per header).

But all these things improvements are just a constant factor. I think
you want the compact SPV proofs described in the appendix of the
sidechains whitepaper which creates log scaling proofs.
