That is a very good point.

We considered whether data existing before a licence change would be
covered, but we hadn't factored the potential need for gaining permissions
for a change to be considered effective.

We have proposed that miners be the main beneficiaries of licensing and
there is a consideration on whether they should vote to adopt the new
terms. While not the preferred route, that would overcome any issues to
what is an otherwise honest 'error and omission.' There doesn't seem to be
anyone who could claim to have suffered any economic losses so this may not
be an issue. It merits further investigation.

The block chain is in perpetual change, so the sooner a change is agreed
upon, if at all, the more data it will cover without any reservations. At
any rate, we believe the changes would be considered effective on a
retrospective basis.
