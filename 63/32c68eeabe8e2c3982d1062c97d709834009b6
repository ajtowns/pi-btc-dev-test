This idea presumes that the protocol has any ability to regulate fees. I
believe the locally optimal strategy for both miners and payers alike is to
accept (pay) zero fees natively in the protocol and instead accept (pay)
their actual fees out-of-band or via OP_TRUE outputs which the miner can
simply collect.  Then the miner sets the fee threshold to ~0 and selects
transactions on the basis of out of band fees.

Miners today already accept out-of-band fees, and as far back as at least
2011 there were miners that would also accept fees in the form of
additional transaction outputs which they were able to spend.
