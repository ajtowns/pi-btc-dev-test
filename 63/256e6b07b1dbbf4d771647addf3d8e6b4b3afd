Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Transaction Replacement by Fee
Message-ID: <2ac49fb0-ff79-5cb9-7b92-14ec791ecc45@dyne.org>

Hello,

Where can I find the rules on transaction replacement?

For instance what are the valid ranges for the sequence values in
transaction inputs? Normally I set this value to MAX_UINT32, and the
locktime to 0.

Can I change the outputs? Can I add more inputs to pay a higher fee?

Just looking for clarity on this aspect of Bitcoin. Any resources would
be much appreciated.

Thanks.
