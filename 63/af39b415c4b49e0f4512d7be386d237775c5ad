Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal: Extended serialization format for BIP-32
Message-ID: <CABuOfuhN6jXgd+KTjFLjM+YkDOVg9=G3tWpeKBJvpUAkpkzjDg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I understand the motivation of adding the birthdate field. However, not
very comfortable with having this in the public key serialization. There
are privacy implication of both the birthday field and having the complete
derivation path, which takes space.

I am fine with Thomas proposal of {x,y,z}. Having additional version byte
field looks modular but since since we already have the big enough version
field in bip32, better to use that instead of adding more bytes.

Thomas, can you please explain why we require different version for P2WPKH
or P2WSH versus (P2WPKH or P2WSH) nested in P2SH. It looked to me that they
would have the same output bitcoin address and under same account.
