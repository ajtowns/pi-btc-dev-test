Hello,

Cozz Lovan has been doing great work on Bitcoin Core's wallet code lately.

If anyone cares about Bitcoin Core's wallet, for example its
performance, do help testing and reviewing these improvements so that
they can make it into 0.10:

Subtract fee from amount
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4331

[Wallet] Improve ReorderTransactions(..)
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4697

[Wallet] Replace OrderedTxItems(..) with in-memory map
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4702

[Qt] Call checkBalanceChanged() periodically instead for every updated tx
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4712

Move g_signals.SetBestChain(..) below SyncWithWallets
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4798

[Wallet] Call SetBestChain before and after rescan
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4800

[Wallet] Do not flush the wallet in AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe(..)
