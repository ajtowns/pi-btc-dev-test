Yes, you begin to see that the payment protocol, as is has a too narrow scope of a web cart - customer, and does not even fit that.

It is not about payment requests but about business relationships. We need a protocol that deals with that concept instead of individual requests,
so we really get out of the hell of addresses. Business relationships are terminated by the parties at their own and not bey algorithms and timeouts.
