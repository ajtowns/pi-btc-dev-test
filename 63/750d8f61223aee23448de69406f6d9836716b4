TL;DR:

> In 2013, GIMP?s developers pulled the GIMP Windows downloads from
> SourceForge. SourceForge was full of misleading advertisements
> masquerading as ?Download? buttons ? something that?s a problem all over
> the web. 
[...]
> In 2015, SourceForge pushed back. Considering the old GIMP account on
> SourceForge ?abandoned,? they took control over it, locking out the
> original maintainer. They then put GIMP downloads back up on SourceForge,
> wrapped in SourceForge?s own junkware-filled installer.
