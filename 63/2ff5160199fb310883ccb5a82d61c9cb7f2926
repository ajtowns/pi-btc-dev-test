I think you are misunderstanding what is allowed and what is required...

BIP1: "Each BIP must either be explicitly labelled as placed in the
public domain (see this BIP as an example) or licensed under the Open
Publication License"

So BIP1 *requires* PD or OPL but does not forbid other licenses. For
example, you are free to multi license OPL (and additionally: BSD,
MIT, CC0, ...)

BIP2: "Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in
its preamble."

So BIP2 *requires* an acceptable license but does not forbid other
choices. For example, you are free to choose: BSD (and additionally:
PD, CC-BY-SA, WTFPL, BEER, ...)

Huh, I can't find it in the text I read. The text mentions "not
acceptable", but I don't read that as "forbidden".

Right. Though, up to now the majority of the BIP authors chose PD as
the only option.
