As far as I'm concerned, anything that requires the coins to originate
in the wallet with some special form is a non-starter.  The new SIGHASH
type allows you to sign transactions with *any* coins already in your
wallet, and imposes no requirements on anyone paying your cold wallet to
be compatible with your signer. 

Any proposals that require coin origination features means that 100% of
people paying you need to "be nice" and send you coins with this special
structure.  You can't spend old coins that were sent before this
proposal was implemented, and if anyone sends you coins without
respecting the new structure, then your signing devices need the
full-complexity routines to accommodate, which defeats the entire purpose.

I am happy to entertain other ideas that achieve our goals here, but I'm
fairly confident that the new SIGHASH type is the only way that would
allow devices like Trezor to truly simplify their design (and still work
securely on 100% of funds contained by the wallet).
