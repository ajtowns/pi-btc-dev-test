Probably because my descriptions are a bit vague and rambling.

but I can't help but think that a SMC of a bitcoin private key, followed by
a secure multiparty computation of a signature is going to be more secure
overall.

I couldn't figure out how to do it offline.  But one round of exchange
seems to work.

It comes down to the blinding factor (k).  All parties need to agree to it
... which creates the second round.
