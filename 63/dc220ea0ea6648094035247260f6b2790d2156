They *are* the official release as soon as they're uploaded. We may wait
for some extra gitian builds to be more confident and make the announcement
on the forums and such, but the downloads themselves don't change anymore.

It really doesn't matter in what order the different places are updated, as
long as the news is propagated everywhere within a reasonable time-span of
say a day. Requiring a certain order would require unnecessary coordination.

Don't make problems where they don't exist, we have enough actual issues.
