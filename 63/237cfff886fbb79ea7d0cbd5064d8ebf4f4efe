I'm sure it would be *possible*, but testnet and mainnet are entirely
separate networks. Not only that, but the entire point of the testnet is
separation. There is no logic to multiplexing them.

If conservation is an issue, I'd forgo the testnet port. We don't have a
'test ssh' or 'test mail server' port either, most people will just
allocate a temporary number for those themselves.

In case the port is already in use, bitcoin can run on and announce any
another port. There is no strict need for it to be 8333 (or 18333) at all.

There isn't even an argument for convenience. Most of the time, users don't
specify nodes. And in the rare cases that they do they can specify a port
as well.

That's somebody else's problem. Bitcoin is by far the most well-known of
the 'coins' so it may be considered realistic to allocate one or two ports
for it. Or not, in which case the altcoins can forget it too.
