The only implementations with any significant network presence are
btcd and Bitcoin Core, fuzzing them should be sufficient if these
services are doing validation of transactions using one of the two.
For example two of the ones you have linked are based in Insight,
which uses Bitcoin Core for validation.  If they aren't validating
transactions before broadcast they won't make it more than a single
hop through the P2P the network so they are of minimum concern.
