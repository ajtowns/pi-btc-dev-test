No, because of the way the weight is calculated, it is impossible to
create a block that old nodes would perceive as bigger than 1 mb
without also violating the weight limit.
After segwit activation, nodes supporting segwit don't need to
validate the 1 mb size limit anymore as long as they validate the
weight limit. The weight is also the only notion of cost miners need
to consider when comparing txs by feerate (fee per cost, before segwit
tx_fee/tx_size, post-segwit tx_fee/tx_weight).
This is important to remember, because having 2 separated limits or
costs would make block creation and relay policies much harder to
implement.

Therefore a hardfork after segwit can just increase the weight limit
and completely forget about the pre-segwit 1 mb size limit.
