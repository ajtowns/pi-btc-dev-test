GregM, wasn't sure how to answer your question, and as to
conflicts [1]. I think I grasped it in my reply to something on
tor-talk, which is on its way here pending moderation due to bcc.
I put that part below. The FYI referred to seednodes as
they exist on Tor / I2P today.

/ [1] Well bitcoin wouldn't know to offload traffic to any of those
/ blocks, or a specific host on them, if you had them set up locally
/ via *Cat or Phantom... for bitcoin use. It would probably end up
/ half useful similar to the above FYI. But that would just affect
/ bitcoin, not whatever else you were running on them.
