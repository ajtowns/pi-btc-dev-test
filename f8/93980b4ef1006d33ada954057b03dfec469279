I will point out that the current situation is not an accident:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=44 is a great
place to get some context for what happened. I believe you can also
find the other half of this discussion on the mailing list archives.

The cointypes being simple integers was how the code worked as shipped
(in the trezor), so changing the semantics after the fact wasn't a
possibility.

The BIP repository didn't want to constantly deal with updates
unrelated to Bitcoin proper, so a decision was made to move that part
of the standard to a repository willing to handle it.
