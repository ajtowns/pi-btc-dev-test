Lapse of thinking/clarity here. This probably isn't a practical timeframe for 
deployment, unless/until there's an emergency situation. So if the code were 
bundled with SegWit, it would need some way to avoid its early activation 
outside of such an emergency (which could possibly be detected in code, in 
this case).
