Fair: you're not removing them entirely, but you are weakening them compared to
the status quo.

Pity, that does sound like a problem. :(

Miners and full nodes have slightly different priorities here; it's not clear
to me why it matters that they implement slightly different policies.


Still, re-reading your initital post, I'm convinced that the weakening of the
DoS protections is probably not a huge problem, so maybe lets try this in a
release and see what happens.

Notably, if people actually use this new replacement behavior, the institutions
doing these sweeps of unconfirmed outputs might stop doing that! That's
probably a good thing, as respends of potentially conflicted unconfirmed
outputs can be dangerous in reorgs; we're better off if outputs are buried
deeply before being spent again.
