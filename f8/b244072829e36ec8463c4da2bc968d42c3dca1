Hi Jeff,

Thoughts on this part of the proposal:

"Absent/invalid votes are counted as votes for the current hardLimit.
Out of range votes are counted as the nearest in-range value."

1. Why should an absent vote be considered a vote for the status quo?  A
non-voter should have zero impact on the result.

2. Why should out of range votes be counted?  They're an invalid vote, a
spoiled ballot as such, and thus it would be better if they were discarded.

Regards,
Simon
