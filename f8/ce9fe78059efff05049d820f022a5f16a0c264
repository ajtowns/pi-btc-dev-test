Yep.

Possibly ~ In my past message(s), I've suggested that Jeff's BIP 100
is a better alternative to Gavin's proposal(s), but that I didn't
think that this should be taken to mean that I am saying one thing is
"superior" to Gavin's work, rather, I emphasized that Gavin work with
Jeff and Adam.

At least, at this stage the things are in a BIP process.

If the BIP 100 and BIP 101 would be combined, what would that look
like on paper?
