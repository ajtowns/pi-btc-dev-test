In general I do very little with the database while developing the UI. I
have various seperate bitcoin data directories (both testnet and mainnet)
to try things out. Before doing something risky I just make a copy.

These days I also do a lot of development with -regtest, as it allows
quickly setting up test scenarios.

What are you trying to test specifically? The progress bar while reindexing?

If you have database problems are you perhaps switching between 0.8.x and
0.9.x with the same directory? In that case see the downgrading warning
here: https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.0/README.txt .
