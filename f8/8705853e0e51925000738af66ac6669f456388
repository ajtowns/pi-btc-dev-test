Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 72 updated: require Accept HTTP header
Message-ID: <CABsx9T1WD5de-pWH2AsdWYi2RnZ-+upbeFEn4es8H3M3wo_bzw@mail.gmail.com>

I just added a requirement to the BIP 72 (bitcoin: URI payment protocol)
spec:

Wallets must include an Accept HTTP header in HTTP requests:

Accept: application/bitcoin-paymentrequest

... and submitted a pull request so the reference implementation follows
the spec.

Thanks to Stephen/Jeff at BitPay for the suggestion. I'll make a similar
change to BIP 70 and require wallets set Accept:
application/bitcoin-paymentrequestack when sending the Payment and
expecting a PaymentACK message in return.
