Greetings Bitcoin Dev,

This is a proposal to improve the ability of bitcoin users to rely on 
unconfirmed transactions.  It can be adopted incrementally, with no hard 
or soft fork required.

https://github.com/dgenr8/out-there/blob/master/ds-dep-win.md

Your thoughtful feedback would be very much appreciated.

It is not yet implemented anywhere.

Cheers,
