My BIP draft didn't make progress because the community opposes any block size 
increase hardfork ever. Your version doesn't address the current block size 
issues (ie, the blocks being too large). So you've retained the only certain-
DOA parts of my proposal, and removed the most useful part... I'm not sure the 
point. Also, your version is now EXCLUSIVELY a hardfork, so it makes no sense 
to keep the BIP 9 deployment at all - either it gets consensus or it doesn't, 
but miners have no part in deployment of it.
