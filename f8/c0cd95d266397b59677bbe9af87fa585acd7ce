Yes, I think this is indeed what OP_CHECK_AGG_SIG really does.

What I propose is that we have two places where we aggregate public keys: one at the script level, and one at the transaction level.  OP_ADD_AGG_PUBKEY adds to the script-level aggregate, then OP_CHECK_AGG_SIG adds the script-level aggregate to the transaction-level aggregate.

Unfortunately it will not work since transaction-level aggregate (which is actually what gets checked) is different between pre-fork and post-fork nodes.

It looks like signature aggregation is difficult to reconcile with script...
