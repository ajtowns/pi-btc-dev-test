I've been doing system design for about 10 years and I can understand your 
initial response.

I have to disagree with you, though.  Surely decentralized adds an overhead, 
but in its place it adds replication, redundancy and very cheap expansion of 
capacity.

Remember when we went from single-core CPUs to multi-core (and 
hyperthreading)? Developers were saying it was useless because all apps were 
still single-threaded.  And now, 15 years later, there are fantastic 
frameworks to make this easy.

Same will happen with distributed. Any assumption you wrote above is not 
inherent in the technology.
