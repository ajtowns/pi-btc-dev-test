I think scheduling the meeting in UTC (=Iceland time) makes sense internationally because different locales have different DST or no DST at all, so all in all that makes it more complex. It's true that this can make a convenient time less convenient half of the year, for some people, but I don't think there's a time that works for everyone anyway...
