A discussion over such a system would be on-topic. Indeed I have made my
own proposals for systems with that capability in the past:

There's no reason to invoke alts however. There are ways where this can
be done within the bitcoin ecosystem, using bitcoins:

Bitcoin is not a centralized system, and neither is its development. I
don't even know how to respond to that. Bringing up altchains is a total
red herring.

This is *bitcoin*-development. Please don't make it have to become a
