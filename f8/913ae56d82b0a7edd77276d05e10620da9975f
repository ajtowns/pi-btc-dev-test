That's why some people are advocating formalizing the process. Political pressure will happen anyway, whether somebody likes it or not. It's better to deal with it in the open.

Except the block size is not gravity. It's more like an arbitrary decision to limit planes' wingspan to the most typical hangar door of 1940.

And now we have a "controversy" that we can't have modern planes out of the fear they won't fit into some of the old hangars. 

And to continue with this nice example, some people are even arguing that "the demand for flight is, essentially, limitless, so why bother making larger jets at all?"
