So if you picked up the BLE broadcast request. All you know is that
*someone* within 100m is requesting bitcoin at a certain address. Not
necessarily who. The *name* is both optional, and possibly just a *handle*
of the user. If I'm sitting 5 ft away from someone at dinner and wanted to
pay them via BLE, I might see "Monkey Dude" on my list and simply ask him
"is that you?" If so, I send it. If there are two "Monkey Dude's" Then I
have to bother with the address prefix, but not otherwise.
