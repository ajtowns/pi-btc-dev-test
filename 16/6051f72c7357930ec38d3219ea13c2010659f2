I seriously find this pretty sad... you said that paying rent was an
issue and your time was better spent on "more fundamental issues..." but
the very least you could do is post a donation address... Is there
someone who was working with you closely on the concept who could take
it up since you are not going to be working on it?

I don't want to camp on Justus's thread on reusable payment codes ~ but
on the subject of BIP 63, it just did make sense to mention... so if
someone does have interest in working on it... please go to
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1083961.0
and reply there.
