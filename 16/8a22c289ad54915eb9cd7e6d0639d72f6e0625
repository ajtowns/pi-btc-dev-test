BIP 19 does not explicitly purport to directly change policy. It defines a 
standard way of assembling multisig transactions.

This is omitted from the BIP (in fact, it doesn't even have a Specification 
section!). No objections to a BIP specifying standards to use for 
authoring/modifying transactions for RBF, but it should leave out policy (or 
at least constrain it to a strictly non-normative section.
