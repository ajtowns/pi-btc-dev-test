Obviously more is better, but it's difficult to say how concerned we should be without more information. I posted my thoughts last month: http://coinchomp.com/2014/03/19/bitcoin-nodes-many-enough/

In my opinion, the number of full nodes doesn't matter (as long as
it's enough to satisfy demand by other nodes).

What matters is how hard it is to run one. If someone is interesting
in verifying that nobody is cheating on the network, can they, and can
they without significant investment? Whether they actually will
depends also no how interesting the currency and its digital transfers
are.

My own network crawler (which feeds my DNS seeder) hasn't seen any
significant drop that I remember, but I don't have actual logs. It's
seeing around 6000 "well reachable nodes" currently, which is the
highest number I've ever seen (though it's been around 6000 for quite
a while now).
