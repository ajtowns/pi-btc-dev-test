I don't intend to work on that myself but that's up to the people that
want to contribute to that. Once it's a separate project it could
either be a big success, or it could slowly wither away. It can have a
release cycle separate from the node. Likely faster.

The organizational reason to split off the wallet is to get rid of
that responsibility (and code) from the bitcoind repo. Maintaining a
wallet should not be part of maintaining the core infrastructure. But
just deleting it would be unreasonable.

Hah. I've thought about that migration path as well.

>From my experience the main thing people are missing with BitcoinJ is
a quick and easy way to set up a wallet as a daemon, to use the
functionality from non-java through RPC.

But there are other interesting upcoming wallet projects as well, for
example CoinVault.
