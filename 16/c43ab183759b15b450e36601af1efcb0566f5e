Hi Tomas,

I've read it and think it is an excellent work, I'd like to see it
integrated into bitcoin-core as a 'kernel module'.

I see there are a lot of proof of concepts out there, IMO every one
deserve a room in the bitcoin client as a selectable feature, to make the
software more flexible and less dictatorial, an user could easily select
which features she wants to run.

Best regards,
Marcos
