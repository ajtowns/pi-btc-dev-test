At
http://media.scmagazine.com/documents/127/virtual_currency_rules_31557.pdf,
section 200.3(c)(2) lists "consumers that utilize Virtual Currency solely
for the purchase or sale of goods or services or for investment purposes"
as "Persons [who] are exempt from the licensing requirements".

Who else is left?
