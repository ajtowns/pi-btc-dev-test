Fair enough, though people still manage okay with phone numbers.  And a
decentralized naming system seems to come at great cost - with namecoin you
need the whole blockchain to resolve names without trust.  Strip out a bell
and whistle - meaningfulness and transferability of names - and you get a
simple, rudimentary (spam killing!) system that scales on any device.  I'll
only argue that it seems to be Good Enough *for the types of people who
might care about decentralized names*.  Probably a very small set :)
