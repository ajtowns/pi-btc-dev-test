Anonymity isn't a feature we claim to have, nor a goal of the project for the 
most part. Using a single Bitcoin address has many problems besides non-
anonymity: your customers are denied basic privacy and there is no good way to 
guarantee the user who says he paid you really did (since transaction ids are 
public record, anyone can claim they sent it).

In short, it is for the most part considered a rule to always use a unique 
address per transaction or at least per customer.
