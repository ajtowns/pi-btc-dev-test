Understood... When I wrote the BIP proposal I was assuming
(incorrectly) that CPFP TX selection was already being done by miners,
but I see now that certain trees could bloom the TX selection latency
as miners would need to be more dependency aware.  Perhaps the BIP66
orphan block chain shows that some miners may not always be counted on
to ensure that all TX stuffed in a block have dependencies met.
Certainly not until the PR1647 is fully merged and deployed.

Yes... although I certainly admit, I didn't know about CPFP or I would
have called it out as a requirement for this UI enhancement request.
I'll see if I can't get some wallet authors interested in this as a
feature enhancement when PR1647 commits.

Perhaps there are risks raised if CPFP is not enabled but these sweep
tx enter the mempool.  If miners take the high fee "children" but
ignore the low fee "parents" then the child might enter the blockchain
without the parent.  If miners were light on block validation,
wouldn't it be possible that the child may go forward with many
confirmations, while the parent patiently waits in the mempool?  This
could be bad since spending the child may look good, as it might have
many confirmations, while its parent has few.

Very good!  So if I follow, RPF can work one of two ways:

In the "countermeasure" form, spender gives receiver a partially
signed "countermeasure" transactions with juiced up fees.

In the "anyonecanpay" form, spender signs the transaction with
ANYONECANPAY bit allowing the reviver to add fees at will.

One question I did have about RBF is this.. Is it correct to presume
that the spender doesn't send the incomplete "countermeasure"
transaction to the network?  If they did, wouldn't they get flagged on
DoS code banning them from peers?

Corollary question.  If the "countermeasure" transaction is not
broadcast, is it sent to the receiver via back channel (email, etc)

I'll try to clean up the draft BIP to include CPFP dependencies and
RBF capabilities.  Whether it belongs in a BIP or a PR, its just a doc
to outline my thoughts at this point.  Not burning a whole in my head,
so may take some time.

Thx.
