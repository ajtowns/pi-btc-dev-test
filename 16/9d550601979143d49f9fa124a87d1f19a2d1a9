or free power to mine;"

why?
wouldn't a bigger block size actually allow for more transactions per
block, therefore more fees to be collected, and the cost spread out among
many more users (thus still keeping tx fees low). If anything, wouldn't
bigger blocksizes are needed to suplement the losses of coinbase rewards
being halfed.
