The paper http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~stevenag/bitcoin_threshold_signatures.pdf
does not mention anything special about the polynomial to use other than:
 "random polynomial f of degree t - 1 such that d = f(0)"

Do you have reasons to assume that there is more to this? Since this is compatible
with Matt's proposal.
