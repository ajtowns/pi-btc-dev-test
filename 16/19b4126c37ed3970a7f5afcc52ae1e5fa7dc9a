According to the Oxford Dictionary, "coin" as a verb means "invent (a 
new word or phrase)". Undoubtedly you created the first functional SPV 
client but please retract the claim "I coined the term SPV" or that's 
plagiarism.

And I'd like to highlight the following excerpt from the whitepaper: 
"the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated 
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the 
network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts 
from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the 
user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to 
confirm the inconsistency."

Header only clients without any fraud detecting mechanism are functional 
but incomplete SPV implementations, according to Sathoshi's original 
definition. This might be good enough for the first generation SPV 
wallet, but eventually SPV clients should be ready to detect any rule 
violation in the blockchain, including things like block size (as 
Satoshi mentioned "invalid block", not just "invalid transaction").
