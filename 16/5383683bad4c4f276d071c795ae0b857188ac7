Let me clarify. SSL renders BGP redirection useless because the browser
holds the signatures of CA's it trusts: an attacker cannot spoof a
certificate because it needs to be signed by a trusted CA: that's the point
of SSL, it encrypts and proves identity, the latter part is what thwarts
MITM. If there was an MITM the browser screams pretty loudly about it with
a big threat warning interstitial.
