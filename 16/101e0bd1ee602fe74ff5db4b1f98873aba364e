I believe I understand what the opcode does directly? it just
validates an opaque signautre. I don't understand how it enables
anonymous transactions.

Can you spell this out for me?

In particular I don't see why it is not, from the perspective of the
blockchain, isomorphic to a hash locked transaction.   (This
equivalence is more obvious when you think about how lamport
signtures turn simple hashing into a one time signature).
