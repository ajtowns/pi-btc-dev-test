This is a security issue: if you can find a likely scenario where the
system fails, that's a problem and we need to fix it.

You've taken the scenario where the system fails, and changed the
conditions to create a scenario where it works. That's not particularly
interesting or noteworthy.

To use a car analogy, Pieter Wuille has shown that the brake cylinders
have a fatigue problem, and if used in stop-and-go traffic regularly
they'll fail during heavy braking, potentially killing someone. You've
countered with a study of highway driving, showing that if the car is
only used on the highway the brakes have no issues, claiming that the
car design is perfectly safe.
