Unfortunately, even "yourself" seems not to know what he is talking
about (so imagine for other people, 256 bits is advised --> 32B),
probably that's why you brought this discussion off the list, then
making recommendations to improve something that is misleading and messy
is quite dubious

And maybe you should take a look at what people you are talking to are
doing before arguing stuff that you apparently don't know very well (ie
"the length of the *derived *key", not the seed), cf
https://github.com/Ayms/bitcoin-wallets
<https://github.com/Ayms/bitcoin-wallets> and even
https://github.com/Ayms/zcash-wallets (not official but
https://github.com/zcash/zips/issues/95)
<https://github.com/Ayms/zcash-wallets>

But as you can notice there is a missing feature, ie to derive the
wallets from xpriv, there is a comment in the repo why I don't like some
things "Surprisingly from ~32 bytes keys BIP32 ends up with a 78 bytes
format to describe them with all the necessary information like indexes,
parent to possibly allow to revert the tree"

That's another thing I completely dislike with BIP39, it ends up with
xpriv, not the 32B seed, there are many, many, many posts in forums of
people fighting to figure out their private keys derived from bip39/44/etc

"No offence too" but please keep your advises for yourself, I indeed
don't read closely inept BIPs, and never said I did not like BIP32,
that's the contrary, I really like it

Before firing plenty of BIPs that do not fit together people maybe
should take a break and see what people are doing today (this is quite
amazing) and why they got stolen

And you seem to know very little about security, if you suspect you home
printer, then suspect you OS, your hw, etc, (you really envision to
generate a seed from a mobile device ???) writing 64 characters is not
very difficult for a human being, even easier than writing x words of y
length

See this too
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2550529.msg26133887#msg26133887,
the tutorial was corrected, but basic things are still missing, an
offline version is when you disconnect from the internet, not when you
use the "offline version"? (assuming that the browser storage or other
stuff are not used...)

Re-ccing the list because again at a certain point of time the theory
should look at the reality and adapt accordingly, part of the example I
gave is off topic for this thread but globally (which could become
another thread) the message is: the bitcoin community should stop making
things complicate for people, releasing BIPs of no use just ends up with
complicating things more than it helps, people deserve to understand
what they are doing, manage their keys by their own and stop syncing
useless full nodes for every coin to sync their wallets, that's why I
made the tool, the first people that used it made some outstanding
mistakes that I did not envision now it's not possible any longer,
except if they give wrong destination addresses and nobody can't do
anything about this (btw the primary intent of the tool was for myself
and you are right for once, I did not know that people could do so big
mistakes, that's not their fault, I see it now, my mistake for
underestimating this)
