Just a quick and dirty check if something bad actually happened. 430
transactions that were confirmed in the alt-chain, are not confirmed
in the true blockchain. The good news is that as far as I can tell
most of them are low volume transactions destined for SD.

7 transactions were true double spends, or to be more precise
transactions in which an conflicting transaction was confirmed in the
new chain (with their respective amount):

b961bc0c663a46893afd3166a604e7e2639533522d9fec61fdb95eb665e86f5a 0.61 BTC
138063e4bdb76feaa511f1e7f9c681eb468ef9140c141671741c965e503b84c6 1.62 BTC
a10bd194cdbf9aa4c12eb0b120056998a081a9b0d93d70570edff24dec831f90 0.81

So the one transaction that really hurt was the one published on
BitcoinTalk. We're not yet out of the woods as some of the 423
transactions still have a chance of being doublespent, but looks like
it's not that bad after all.

Cheers,
Chris
