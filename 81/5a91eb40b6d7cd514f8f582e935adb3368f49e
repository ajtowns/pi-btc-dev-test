It would be also a nice opportunity to move the height to a more
accessible place.
For example CBlockHeader::hashMerkleRoot (and CBlockIndex's) could be
replaced with a hash of the following struct:

struct hashRootStruct
{
uint256 hashMerkleRoot;
uint256 hashWitnessesRoot;
int32_t nHeight;
}

But then all wallet software will need to adapt their software twice.
Why introduce technical debt for no good reason?

Uncontroversial hardforks can also be deployed with small risks as
described in BIP99.
