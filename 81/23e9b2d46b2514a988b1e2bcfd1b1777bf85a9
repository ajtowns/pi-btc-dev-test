Yes, this is almost what -has- to happen in the long term.

Ideally we should start having wallets generate those proofs now, and then
introduce the max-age as a second step as a planned hard fork a couple
years down the line.

However,
1) There is also the open question of "grandfathered" UTXOs - for those
wallets generated in 2009, buried in a landfill and then dug out 10 years
ago

2) This reverses the useful minimization attribute of HD wallets - "just
backup the seed"
