Andy sounded very convincing when talking in favor of URLs. What's

Why don't just...

bitcoin://url.without.explicitly.specifying.provider
bitcoin://alias at provider
bitcoin://IIBAN at authorizedBitcoinInstitution ??

By the way, I don't like the fact that a single authorized institution
needs to map the IIBANs to bitcoin addresses.
