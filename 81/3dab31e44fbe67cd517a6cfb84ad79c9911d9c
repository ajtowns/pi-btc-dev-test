Graftroot also break blind signature schemes. Consider a protocol such as [1]
where some party has a bunch of UTXOs all controlled (in part) by the same
key X. This party produces blind signatures on receipt of new funds, and can
only verify the number of signatures he produces, not anything about what he
is signing.

BTW, the same concern holds for SIGHASH_NOINPUT, which I'd also like to be
disable-able. Maybe we should extend one of ZmnSCPxj's suggestions to include
a free "flags" byte or two in the witness?

(I also had the same concern about signature aggregation. It seems like it's
pretty hard to preserve the "one signature = at most one input" invariant of
Bitcoin, but I think it's important that it is preserved, at least for
outputs that need it.)

Or maybe, since it appears it will require a space hit to support optional
graftroot anyway, we should simply not include it in a proposal for Taproot,
since there would be no opportunity cost (in blockchain efficiency) to doing
it later.
