You know if you want to make some form of investment, you might like make an
attempt to look them up on the internet, check the phone number in a phone
book or directory enquiries, look for references and reviews?

So it is with the hash of the binary you are about to trust with your
investment funds.  I dont think its such a difficult question.  Ask your
more technical friends to confirm this hash is correct.

Its interesting that hashes are more trustworthy than signatures, since all
the NSLs and backdoors, its hard to trust a signature.

I have the same problem with linux distros that want to install hundreds of
components downloaded over the internet, based on signatures.  I would far
rather a merkle hash of the distribution at that point in time, which
authenticates directly any of the optional downloadable components.

(Or better yet a distro that like comes on a CD and doesnt download
anything...  Amazing how most CD and even DVD iso images immediately
download stupid things like fonts???  What were they thinking?  I downloaded
fedora > 4GB of stuff and they need to download a font just to get past step
2 of the installer?  Thats a sensless, retrograde, selective backdoor
opportunity.)
