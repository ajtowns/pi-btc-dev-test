Agreed, however I don't think it would be impossible or even really that
difficult, and would be a great way to increase decentralization while
simultaneously fixing other issues with mining.

Proofs of work would be valid if they're built on top of the current block
hash, and we could require (difficulty/N) proofs of work that are >=
(difficulty/N) to assemble a valid block.  Same as mining shares work.

The block assembler who finds the final diff/N 'share' could get a small
bonus as an incentive to complete the block as quickly as possible.  Or
alternatively, a checksum could be computed of all the current diff/N
shares in the mempool and that way only the final share would need to be
broadcasted to the entire network, and clients with the correct checksum
could assemble the block themselves without having to download the entire
block.  This would drastically decrease data usage on the network.

Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

The possibility that a previously 'good' actor with 30% of the hashpower
going 'rogue' becomes more and more of a concern as the block subsidy
decreases.

What is the incentive not to go on record about this?
