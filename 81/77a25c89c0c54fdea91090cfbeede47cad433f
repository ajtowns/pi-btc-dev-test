Hello Angel,

Good initiative. This looks good. If I understand, the dropdown menu is for
the whole application, so it make sense to have it in a common part of the
layout.

A slight optimisation would be to write the unit in the transaction table
header too (since we read from top to bottom). This would give something
like "Amount (mBTC)". That way, the user doesn't have to think twice about
the unit of his values.


Hope it helps,
