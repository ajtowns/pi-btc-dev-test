Mode could be ruled out immediately. Just consider this: 34% 8MB, 33% 
1.5MB, 33% 1.2MB

I personally believe the median is the most natural and logical choice. 
51% of miners can always force the 49% to follow the simple majority 
choice through a 51% attack. Using median will eliminate the incentive 
to 51% attack due to this reason. The incentive to 51% attack will exist 
when you use any value other than 50-percentile. The further it is from 
50, the bigger the incentive.

Having said that, I don't think it is an absolutely bad idea to use a 
value other than 50-percentile. The exact value is debatable.

However, if you use something other than median, you should make it 
symmetrical. For example, the block size will increase if the 
20-percentile is bigger than the current limit, and the block size will 
decrease if the 80-percentile is smaller than the current limit.
