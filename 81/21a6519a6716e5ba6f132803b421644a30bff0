This looks very interesting. The first time implementing it might be more
painful but that will make subsequent hardforks a lot easier.

Do you think it's good to include the median timestamp of the past 11 blocks
after the block height in coinbase? That would make it easier to use it as
activation threshold of consensus rule changes.

For the witness commitment, it will also be treated as a merge mined
commitment?

It is also good to emphasize that it is the responsibility of miners, not
devs, to ensure that the hardfork is accepted by the supermajority of the
economy.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Pre-BIP Growth Soft-hardfork

Here's a draft BIP I wrote almost a year ago. I'm going to look into
revising and completing it soon, and would welcome any suggestions for doing
so.

This hardfork BIP aims to accomplish a few important things:
- Finally deploying proper merge-mining as Satoshi suggested before he left.
- Expanding the nonce space miners can scan in-chip, avoiding expensive
  calculations on the host controller as blocks get larger.
- Provide a way to safely deploy hardforks without risking leaving old nodes
  vulnerable to attack.
