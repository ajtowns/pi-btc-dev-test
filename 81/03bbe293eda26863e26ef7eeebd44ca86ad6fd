Subject: [bitcoin-dev]  BIP Process and Votes
Message-ID: <COL402-EAS109000AAC490BCF2DD69116CDAF0@phx.gbl>

I would like to start a civil discussion on an undefined, or at least unwritten, portion of the BIP process.  Who should get to vote on approval to commit a BIP implementation into Bitcoin Core?  Is a simple majority of these voters sufficient for approval?  If not, then what is?
