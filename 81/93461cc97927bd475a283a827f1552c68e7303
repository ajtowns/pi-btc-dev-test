I see no reason to restrict compressed/uncompressed.  Strings don't have
to be the same length to sort them lexicographically.  If a multi-sig
participant provides an uncompressed key, they are declaring that the
key that they use and it will only be used uncompressed.   Clients don't
have to go looking for all combinations of compressed & uncompressed.
