BIPs  are accepted into BIP repo with a low "reasonable" threshold.

Code is accepted into the Bitcoin Core repo when it is likely that the
community will accept a change.

There is no voting in the way you think. Devs commit changes the users will
accept and use. Users "fire" developers by choosing different devs or
different software.

Standard open source method.
