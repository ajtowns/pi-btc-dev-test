I'd love to have the same in Bitcoin-Qt as well. Too many sob stories about
people with outdated backups that lost part or all of their coins. These
are much more common than fee messups.

What we should really do is:

- Use deterministic wallets. Making regular backups becomes optional (to
retain label and transaction data and such) instead of mandatory.

- Don't support importing private keys. Replace the importing of private
keys by a "sweep" function.
