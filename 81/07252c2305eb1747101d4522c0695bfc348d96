> Mining infrastructure follows price.  If bitcoins were still trading at 1
USD per coin, nobody will build mining infrastructure to the same level as
today, with 5000 USD per coin.

In the case of bitcoin, it is the price that follows mining
infrastructures. The price is at 5000 because it is difficult to mine
bitcoin not the other way around, like you mention it. Even with a fixed
demand, price would go up as difficulty grow, the supply guide the market.
There is a strong incentive to mine blindly as it is difficult to estimate
for a miner where is the actual demand, with a start up currency without
actual economic support. Indeed at the genesis of this "mining-price" cycle
the incentive was to contribute to a network and create ones own supply,
and not respond to a demand.
