Exactly.

This I disagree with -- if they know that they have been attacked, then
there is every reason to come forward with this information.

First of all, it offers an explanation for poor profits (this is better
than unexplained poor profits).

Second of all, if one pool can be attacked then any pool can be attacked --
this is not a reason not to mine on a particular pool.  If anything, it's a
reason to diversify hashrate among many pools.
