Please, nobody is asking for this.
Nobody should produce segwit transactions until the softfork is
activated, after which those transactions aren't anyone-can-spend
anymore.
After activation, nobody can be forced to use the new format
immediately (or ever) if they don't want to reduce their tx fees.
Maybe because they want to be additionally cautious or maybe because
they haven't implemented the new features yet.
Either way, it is fine that some people upgrade later since, as
repeated by many, this is a backward compatible change.
