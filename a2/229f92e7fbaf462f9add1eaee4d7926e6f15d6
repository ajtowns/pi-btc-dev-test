Bounties would be much less than a developer salary. The idea is not to pay
for people full time, but it would be more of a symbolic gesture to attract
developers and get them some coins.  People with coins are also more
motivated to make the project more valuable, otherwise you have a "tragedy
of the commons" problem.

Not that I don't agree Gavin with getting a salary but that's a completely
independent issue :)
