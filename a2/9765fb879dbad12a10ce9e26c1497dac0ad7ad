Thanks Mike for the Tip :-)

I will definitely extend the calculations to include a size-normalized
version. As for transaction propagations, being much smaller the
measurements tend to be much noisier, but given enough samples we
might be able to reconstruct some of the system parameters.

Good idea to attempt to correlate propagation speed and number of
inputs/outputs, might be interesting to see whether processing at the
nodes has an influence.

Regards,
Chris
