I highly, highly doubt any seriously technical person is making any kind of decision on block size issues based on their own personal network. If you're assuming this is a serious motivating factor for anyone, then I'm not sure you've even been reading your email or listening to the conversations you've had with people over the last year or more.

It's probably due to me: When I point to trends and broadband
_distribution_ in the US (much less the less developed parts of the
world), I'm being "hypothetical", and when I point to my _own_
connectivity as a concrete example it's "personal". It's no joke that
communication is _hard_ but it's a shared responsibility however, and
no need to assume anyone isn't reading.,
