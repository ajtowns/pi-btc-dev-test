I don't think that's what John means.

If you have hash power for the parent chain, mining invalid blocks for the
merge-mined chain costs you nothing. Yes, they will be invalid, but you've
lost nothing.

The basic assumption underlying mining security is that it is more profitable
to collaborate with mining a chain (and profit from the block payout) than to
attack it. In the case of merged mining, this assumption is not valid.
