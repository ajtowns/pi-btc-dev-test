Clients have to update in some way to get the benefit of this right?

An SPV client which fully validated the header chain would simply reject
the hard forking header.  Last time I checked, the Bitcoinj SPV wallet
ignored the version bits, and just followed the longest chain.  Is that
still the case?

In fact, does Core enforce the 95% rule for the soft-forks before checking
for long forks?  I am assuming that it happens when checking headers rather
than when checking full blocks.
