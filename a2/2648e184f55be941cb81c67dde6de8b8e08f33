Gah, accidentally send.... I wanted to continue here that it was less
than 8500 and had been falling pretty consistently for months,
basically since the bitcoin.org change.  Unfortunately it looks like
the old bitnodes.io data isn't available anymore, so I'm going off my
memory here.

The Bitnodes counts have always been somewhat higher than my or sipa's
node counts too, fwiw.
