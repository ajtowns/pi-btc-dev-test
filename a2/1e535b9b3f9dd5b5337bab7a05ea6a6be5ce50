There is an exception in the code for "block" messages.

https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoinxt/commit/c81898ec46e4962daf975e352931b848026fdc34#diff-7ec3c68a81efff79b6ca22ac1f1eabbaR3548

This means 2MB limit for all other messages.  "block" messages are limited
to the max block size for 2 hours into the future.

I think setting it to a week into the future might be better, since it is
only a DOS protection.  This would guarantee that message sizes are
reasonable.  The size check would still be done anyway.
