Not just lockTime; potentially any tx locked away in a safe.

Consider low-S enforcement: high chance a non-expert user will be unable
to spend an old transaction.  They need to compromise their privacy
and/or spend time and money.  A milder "confiscation" but a more likely
one.

By that benchmark, we should aim for "reasonable certainty".  A
transaction which would never have been generated by any known software
is the minimum bar.  Adding "...which would have to be deliberately
stupid with many redundant OP_CHECKSIG etc" surpasses it.  The only extra
safeguard I can think of is clear, widespread notification of the
change.

Cheers,
Rusty.
