That's exactly the point: a hard fork does not just affect miners, and
cannot just get decided by miners. All full nodes must have accepted the
new rules, or they will be forked off when the hashrate percentage triggers.

Furthermore, 75% is pretty terrible as a switchover point, as it guarantees
that old nodes will still see a 25% forked off chain temporarily.

My opinion is that the role of Bitcoin Core maintainers is judging whether
consensus for a hard fork exists, and is technically necessary and safe. We
don't need a hashpower vote to decide whether a hardfork is accepted or
not, we need to be sure that full noded will accept it, and adopt it in
time. A hashpower vote can still be used to be sure that miners _also_
agree.

Currently, a large amount of developers and others believe that the
treshhold for a hardfork is not reached, especially given the fact that we
scale in the short term, as well as make many changes that long-term
benefit scalability, with just a softfork (which does not require forking
off nodes that don't adopt the new rules, for whatever reason).
