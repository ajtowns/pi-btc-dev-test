True, it's those compromises that people should base their decision on.
To make that easier was the motivation for me to suggest feature
matrices in the first place.

Right now if I read Electrum's description, it doesn't say anything
about the tradeoffs with a lightweight client like the slightly weaker
privacy guarantees. At best I could deduce that from the fact that
unlike Bitcoin-Qt it doesn't explicitly list privacy as an advantage.

So applying the same "MyBitcoin test" to the current Bitcoin Clients
page and if you want to be fair, we'd have to assume that if it was
indeed included it would also just be a short pitch listing only pros
and no cons. So it would say something like: "MyBitcoin starts instantly
and is really easy to use and great for beginners." etc.

Obviously if you compare a bad matrix to good short descriptions and
vice versa you'll get the conclusion you're trying to get.

I think Alan had the best idea - let's have the Clients page as it is
and have it link to the wiki for those who want a more detailed
comparison. On the wiki page we can then have explanations of the basic
client types, separate matrices for features and for security/privacy
and whatever else might be useful to know when choosing a client. Then
users who don't really care aren't bothered by "too much information"
and users who do can easily click through and find out about the
different tradeoffs.
