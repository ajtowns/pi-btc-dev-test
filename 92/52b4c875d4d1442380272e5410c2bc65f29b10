Sorry again, I keep auto-sending from gmail when trying to delete.

In theory, using the "nuclear option", the block size can be increased via
soft fork.

Version 4 blocks would contain the hash of the a valid extended block in
the coinbase.

<block height> <32 byte extended hash>

To send coins to the auxiliary block, you send them to some template.

OP_P2SH_EXTENDED <scriptPubKey hash> OP_TRUE

This transaction can be spent by anyone (under the current rules).  The
soft fork would lock the transaction output unless it transferred money
from the extended block.

To unlock the transaction output, you need to include the txid of
transaction(s) in the extended block and signature(s) in the scriptSig.

The transaction output can be spent in the extended block using P2SH
against the scriptPubKey hash.

This means that people can choose to move their money to the extended
block.  It might have lower security than leaving it in the root chain.

The extended chain could use the updated script language too.

This is obviously more complex than just increasing the size though, but it
could be a fallback option if no consensus is reached.  It has the
advantage of giving people a choice.  They can move their money to the
extended chain or not, as they wish.
