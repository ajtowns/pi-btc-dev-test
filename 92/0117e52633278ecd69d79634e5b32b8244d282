Well okay; it seems to me that that is considerably bigger task, and I'm not 
sure how likely that is to appear.  But that sounds workable, since my 
feature request is simply this filtering system with the filter set to 
"ALL"; so I can hardly complain about that.

I can't say I see what the point of all that added complexity is, contracts 
are usually more than just financial, and the ability to pick a slightly 
different set of source inputs doesn't seem like a hugely useful feature; 
but I'm willing to accept someone thinks it is a good idea and leave it at 
that.  I withdraw my "move sequence number" feature request.

What then allows the contract out of the memory pool into a chain?  The 
locktime?  No, no, forget it... I don't want to open a new can of worms.
