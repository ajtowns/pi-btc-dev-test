Subject: [Bitcoin-development] bitcoind and C++ namespaces?
Message-ID: <CAJHLa0Mu+1jB8gPbzH3JTXk0uWTJiZOfogffj6+nUfekOgN-0A@mail.gmail.com>

Slowly warming to C++ namespaces.  How about starting small, and
wrapping most stuff inside a bitcoin namespace?  Bike shedding can be
done at any point; the main idea is to start small, and gain
experience.
