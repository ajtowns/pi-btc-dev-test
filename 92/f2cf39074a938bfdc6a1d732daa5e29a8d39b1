ad "RPC stops working":

* Client makes a 'getinfo' call and don't receive a response in a minute.

"What is your precise RPC usage? "

One process is asking getinfo every second as a fallback to possibly
misconfigured blocknotify. It also calls getblocktemplate every 30 second.
Second process is calling getinfo once a minute to check if bitcoind is
working. If it don't receive a response in a minute, it kills bitcoind and
starts it again.

That's all.

OS is Debian.
