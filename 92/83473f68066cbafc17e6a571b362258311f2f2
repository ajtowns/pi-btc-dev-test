Google recommeds "migrate to safer cryptographic hashes such as SHA-256 and
SHA-3"
It does not mention RIPEMD-160

Does that offer any greater protection? That?s not so clear to me as the
outputs (at least for p2pkh) only verify the public key against the final
20 byte hash. Specifically, in the first (notional) case the challenge
would be to find a private key that has a public key that hashes to the
final hash. In the second (realistic) case, you merely need to add the
sha256 hash into the problem, which doesn?t seem to me to increase the
difficulty by any significant amount?
