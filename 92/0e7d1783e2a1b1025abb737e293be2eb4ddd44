2) -1 doesn't mean conflicted, it means the transaction is not only
unconfirmed buy depends on another unconfirmed transaction.

1) Depends on what you mean by trusted.  If you are giving the user online
access to something that costs you next to nothing to revoke if there is a
problem later, no problem.  0-conf is great.  If you are pre-pairing
shipments and will be able to pull the box from the ship stream if there is
a problem, also no problem.  If you are sending some other non-reversible
thing like crypto, then you might want to be careful.  It really depends on
the value of your things and your tolerance of risk.

In my opinion, an zero-conf transaction is way way better than a credit
card preauth or a check in hand.
