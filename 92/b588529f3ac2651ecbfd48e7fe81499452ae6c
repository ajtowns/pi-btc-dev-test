I think probably the whole signed message thing needs to be rethought. The 
most common "uses" today seem to be insecure cases that it doesn't actually 
work in: people trying to prove ownership of bitcoins and/or that they sent 
bitcoins (current signed messages can do neither). Ideally, whatever the new 
method is should also avoid using the same key as for signing transactions, 
since the public key is technically private information. Furthermore, since 
addresses are semi-deprecated (by the payment protocol), I'm not sure it 
makes sense to do this without designing an entire authentication system, 
which may be rather complex.
