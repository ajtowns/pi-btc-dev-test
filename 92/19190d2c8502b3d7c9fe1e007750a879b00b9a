Thanks. Using --disable-thread_api --disable-replication got it to compile, but now when actually running bitcoind it throws DbRunRecoveryException over the DB_RUNRECOVERY flag.

It seems people aren't actually using MingW to compile bitcoind on Windows? The lack of pthreads seems crippling and there's lots of missing functions like strncasecmp, _strlwr, _fileno and swprintf.
