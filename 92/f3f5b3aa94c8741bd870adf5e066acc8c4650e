Your BIP is a bit confusing: you say "In some circumstances, users may wish to
spend received bitcoins before they have confirmed on the blockchain", but what
you're really referring to isn't spending unconfirmed outputs - which
OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT can't protect - but rather spending outputs with a small
number of confirmations.

In the existing ecosystem, if multi-block reorgs were a regular event Bitcoin
would be in a lot of trouble; since they're rare, advising wallet authors to
simply refuse to make transactions for some time after such a reorg may be a
better solution. After all, a multi-block reorg is a strong indication that
there's somehting very wrong with the network, and it'd be safer to stop using
Bitcoin for awhile until things settle down.
