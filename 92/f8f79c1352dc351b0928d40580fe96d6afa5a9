It makes sense to me that there might be objective conditions under which
we would want to use a number smaller than 2016.  A good example would be a
mean time between blocks of more than 20 minutes over the last 144 blocks
(one  - two days).  If such an occurrence ever happened, and the software
then cut the retarget interval to 1008 (triggering an immediate retarget if
the counter is over 1008), the only problem I see is how to measure the
mean time between blocks.

In fact, has anyone examined the potential problems of reducing the
retarget period, even to one?  Not Really.
<http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/9305/why-not-retarget-on-every-block>
That question includes a suggestion of retargeting on every block, but
using the same 2016 block window for the calculation, so difficulty changes
would be very smooth, and still as unpredictable and how long till we find
the next block.
