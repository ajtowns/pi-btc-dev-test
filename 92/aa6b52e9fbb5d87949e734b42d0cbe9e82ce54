Hi Mike,

I had a similar request on the forums. I suggested adding either a 2 byte 'weeks since genesis' or 'months since genesis', but starting from spec birth works too. Would either of those work for you?

Otherwise you either need to scan the entire chain (slow) or find a fully indexed copy of the block chain (expensive, more centralised). Just add a UNIX time as an extra 4 bytes, or if you want to save a few characters then use a uint16 that represents "days since birth of this specification".
