I don't know what Sergio Lernet meant about miners paying themselves
and future network security.

If miners wanted to offer value-added services, especially if those
services involved adding specific scripts to the outputs of the
generation transaction, the most natural way for their customers to
pay them is to allow inputs to the generation transaction.

It could also be done with pay-to-fee transactions, but that would
make the services more expensive due to risk premium.
