Update: this class of machine just became useless for bitcoin.
When blk0002.dat was created to store more blocks, all forward
progress processing blocks turned into losing ground by 20 or so
a day. Guessing both datfiles were being accessed at once resulting
in disk based overload. I've not seen any other mentions of crypto
in this thread so I'm not sure how well new hardware would perform.
Going shopping I guess.
