I agree, communication efficiency is a concern for some applications, and I
can think of cases where delinearization is the better option as well.

For users that want an "M of N" scheme that

a) doesn't cost more to send funds
b) allows them to lose a device and keep their coins
c) allows them to establish and validate the scheme safely

...  a simple, "verified signer" threshold scheme is probably the best
solution.
