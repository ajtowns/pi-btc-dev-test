But the total reward is what mining will tend toward equalizing in costs.
In any case, the cryptocurrencies are neutral to cost of mining, or perhaps 
even benefit from it being as cheap as possible: if it's cheaper to mine, you 
can get an even higher difficulty/security out of it.

Invalid blocks are rejected by validating clients in all circumstances.

I suspect you may mean a block that doesn't include transactions you want 
confirmed. In that case, you must not be paying sufficient fees for the miner 
to consider it worth their time, or must be doing something the miner 
considers fundamentally objectionable (in which case they won't be satisfied 
by any fee). But these miners, unless they are able to acquire over 50% of the 
hashrate (in which case the cryptocoin is compromised), are not the only ones 
mining blocks, and if another miner accepts your transactions there is no 
issue.
