This brings up an additional point.  If we're mutually trusting
parties (or secured by some kind of external mechanism), and you've
given me a payment which I haven't broadcast for confirmation? and
later we make another transactions I should be able to offer you the
original unconfirmed txn and ask if you'd instead be willing to write
a replacement that combines both payments.
