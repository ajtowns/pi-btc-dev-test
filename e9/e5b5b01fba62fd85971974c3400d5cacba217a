I chose not to address hard fork methodology at this stage because I
wanted to focus on the main algorithm. There are a number of options
open to us for deployment including a simple fixed activation (which I
think is feasible because there is a a lot of awareness and the
industry shows they are willing to rally around a single proposal). If
there are any strong preferences, I can add a deployment section
although I think it's less interesting until we forge a clear way
forward with what blocksize proposal to use.
