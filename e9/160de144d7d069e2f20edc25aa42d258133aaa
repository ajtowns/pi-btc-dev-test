I think the misunderstanding was in perhaps my earlier statement seemed like I was suggesting that it?s the protocol?s responsibility to protect merchants from double-spends. On the contrary - I think we agree - the protocol CANNOT make any guarantees to ANYONE until we do converge on a history. The ?design? I speak of here is more on the merchant side.
