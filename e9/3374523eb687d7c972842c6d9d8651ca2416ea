Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Pre-BIP Growth Soft-hardfork
Message-ID: <201602070952.33457.luke@dashjr.org>

Here's a draft BIP I wrote almost a year ago. I'm going to look into revising 
and completing it soon, and would welcome any suggestions for doing so.

This hardfork BIP aims to accomplish a few important things:
- Finally deploying proper merge-mining as Satoshi suggested before he left.
- Expanding the nonce space miners can scan in-chip, avoiding expensive
  calculations on the host controller as blocks get larger.
- Provide a way to safely deploy hardforks without risking leaving old nodes
  vulnerable to attack.
