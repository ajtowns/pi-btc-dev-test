Resolved -> RTFM

Worked like a champ, first try. Thanks! Wish I had thought to look into that sooner! My c-lightning node?s resource footprint is even smaller now. Unfairly small.

And now that I?ve unexpectedly regained ~180 GB worth of free SSD space from not having that extra full node, I?m feeling wealthy. Accordingly, I?m off to squander my newfound riches over at satoshis?s place. )
