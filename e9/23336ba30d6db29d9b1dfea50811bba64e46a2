If, for example, the majority of miners are in China (they are), and
there is really poor connectivity in and out of China (there is) and a
miner naively optimizes for profit, they will create blocks which are
large and take a while to relay out of China. By simple trial-and-error
an individual large miner might notice that when they create larger
blocks which fork off miners in other parts of the world, they get more
income. Obviously forking off 50% of the network would be a rather
extreme situation and assumes all kinds of simplified models, but it
shows that the incentives here are very far from aligned, and your
simplified good-behavior models are very far from convincing.

The disadvantage is small with 1MB blocks, but already non-zero. 20MB
blocks are much, much worse (lots of things here dont scale linearly,
even just transfer over a high-packet-loss-link). I mentioned this in my
original email as something which doesnt make me comfortable with 20MB
blocks, but something which needs simulation and study, and might
actually be just fine!

Defaults? Dumb designs? Most miners just use the default 750K blocks, as
far as I can tell, other miners probably didnt see transactions relayed
across several hops or so, and a select few miners are doing crazy
things like making their blocks fit in a single packet to cross the gfw,
but that is probably overkill and not well-researched.

Do you have convincing evidence that at 20MB miners will be able to
break even on transaction fees for a long time? (The answer is no
because no one has any idea how bitcoin transaction volumes are going to
scale, period.)

Sure, do you have a value of hashpower which is "secure enough" (which
is a whole other rabbit hole to go down...).

Oh? You mention at http://gavinandresen.ninja/bigger-blocks-another-way
that "I struggle with wanting to stay true to Satoshi?s original vision
of Bitcoin as a system that scales up to Visa-level transaction volume".
That is in direct contradiction.

"it is not a panacea", but everyone in the community seems to be taking
it as one. You've claimed many times that many of the big
webwallet/payment processors/etc have been coming to you and saying they
need bigger block sizes to continue operating. In reality, they dont, it
just makes it easier.
