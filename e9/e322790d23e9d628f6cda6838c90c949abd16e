Why would it be made available for download at sourceforge.net if it's not
actually released? The files are available here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.8.6/ and
people watch the sf rss feeds etc...
Seems to me like there needs to be a better release workflow. As far as the
world is concerned, they are downloading the 0.8.6 and there is a lot of
community buzz about it already.
IMO, to avoid that, no files should be placed online unless they are the
official release.
