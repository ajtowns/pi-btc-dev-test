Using the hash of multiple blocks does not make it any safer. The miner of the last block always determines the results, by knowing the hashes of all previous blocks.

However, since there is also a non-zero risk that a participant in a contract may attempt to bribe a miner the inclusion of multiple block hashes as a source of randomness is a must. Every miner would effectively need to be bribed to ensure control over the results of the random numbers, which is already very unlikely. The risk approaches zero as N goes up.
