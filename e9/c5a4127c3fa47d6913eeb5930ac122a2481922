I?m not familiar with how the daemon works, however could you set up two daemons listening local on different ports and with a separate daemon or normal dns server that proxies incoming queries to either domain? I don?t know if standard DNS servers would support that, or if you would need a custom proxy application.

That's unfortunate as it needs much more spendings from me to operate, second IP address will cost nearly as much as the server itself.
