Actually I might find way to fund it. But I needed to have ACK &
comments from developers before anything.

That is a fair question, we will need anti-DDoS. Unless something better
(and affordable) can be recommended, this would yet put another Bitcoin
website under CloudFlare.

> 4) Who admins it?

Obviously, I thought it would be important that the server is owned by
someone who can be trusted, with ssh access for all core developers.

> 5) Who controls DNS for it?

I'm not sure we'll get any change on this level. I have no idea if the
domain is in good hands, except for the fact that nothing bad happened
thus far. If anything, moving it to core developers (as intended when
the domain was registered) would make more sense IMO. But again, is it
possible, I don't know.
