For that matter, we probably don't want to treat this as a *version*
change, but rather a *feature* flag. For instance, nSequence is
potentially useful for co-ordinating multiple signatures to ensure they
can only be used in certain combinations, a use-case not neccesarily
compatible with this idea of a relative lock. Similarly it's potentially
useful for dealing with malleability.

nSequence is currently the *only* thing in CTxIn's that the signature
signs that can be freely changed; I won't be surprised if we find other
uses for it.

Of course, all of the above is assuming this proposal is useful; that's
not clear to me yet and won't be without fleshed out examples.
