In this case there is no need for P2P communication, just pay to an
address you already have for the other party. If you want to avoid
address reuse, use stealth addressing.

But yes, if you don't have a stealth address for the other party you can
certainly communicate in private as peers where you trust that you share
a public key. The core issue here is really bootstrapping of that trust
in an ad hoc manner.

Yes, proximity is practically the universal solution to the problem of
the payer identifying the correct seller in any face-to-face scenario.

When identification is required (show me some id before I pay you) it
equates to the BIP-70 scenario in the bitcoin model. This is also
required in order guard against repudiation (give me a signed receipt).
