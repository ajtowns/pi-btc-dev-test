Subject: [Bitcoin-development] [QT] how to disable block verification for
	faster UI testing?
Message-ID: <CADZB0_aSpu7v0bVV6Po0RonobGVreWTLN7Mya687PbP2t_-oZg@mail.gmail.com>

the command line options mention a -checklevel  parameter.
I've been passing 0 assuming there'd be little to no verification, but it's
happened a few times that when I open the official binary (while not doing
development) there's some sort of database corruption and Bitcoin-Qt needs
to reindex blocks on disk, a process that can take probably a whole day.

how do you guys develop the UI and avoid these issues?

Cheers,
Angel
