More people using Bitcoin does not necessarily mean more transactions being
processed by the block chain. Satoshi was forward-thinking enough to
include a powerful script-signature system, something which has never
really existed before. Though suffering from some limitations to be sure,
this smart contract execution framework is expressive enough to enable a
wide variety of new features without changing bitcoin itself.

One of these invented features is micropayment channels -- the ability for
two parties to rapidly exchange funds while only settling the final balance
to the block chain, and to do so in an entirely trustless way. Right now
people don't use scripts to do interesting things like this, but there is
absolutely no reason why they can't. Lightning network is a vision of a
future where everyone uses a higher-layer protocol for their transactions
which only periodically settle on the block chain. It is entirely possible
that you may be able to do all your day-to-day transactions in bitcoin yet
only settle accounts every other week, totaling 13kB per year. A 1MB block
could support that level of usage by 4 million people, which is many orders
of magnitude more than the number of people presently using bitcoin on a
day to day basis.

And that, by the way, is without considering as-yet uninvented applications
of existing or future script which will provide even further improvements
to scale. This is very fertile ground being explored by very few people.
One thing I hope to come out of this block size debate is a lot more people
(like Joseph Poon) looking at how bitcoin script can be used to enable new
and innovative resource-efficient and privacy-enhancing payment protocols.

The network has room to grow. It just requires wallet developers and other
infrastructure folk to step up to the plate and do their part in deploying
this technology.
