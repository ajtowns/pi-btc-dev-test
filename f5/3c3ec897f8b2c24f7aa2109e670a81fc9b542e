Ah, I forgot about that particular wart. Yech.  Implies that you can
order inputs or outputs, not both.

Something like "outputs must be in order, inputs which do not
CHECK(MULTI)SIG_(VERIFY) a SIGHASH_SINGLE sig must be in order with
respect to each other".  But that's much less trivial since it implies
script evaluation.

In other news, I noticed Kristov Atlas's concurrent proposal just after
I posted this (via reddit).  He used far more words, but didn't note
this issue either AFAICT.

Thanks!
Rusty.
