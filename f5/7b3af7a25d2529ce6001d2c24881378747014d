Well with bitcoin, (average) time, number of blocks and (maximum) size are
all related to each other so it doesn't matter how it is specified, it's
always possible to give estimates of all three.

As for implementation it indeed makes most sense to work with block ranges.

This assumes that nodes will always be storing the latest blocks. For
dynamic nodes that take part in the consensus this makes sense.

Just wondering: Would there be a use for a [static] node that, say, always
serves only the first 100000 blocks? Or, even, a static range like block
100000 - 200000?
