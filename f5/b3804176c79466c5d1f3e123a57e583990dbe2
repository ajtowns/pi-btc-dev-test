Mhmm, I hadn't thought about this. This makes sense and actually
explains the urgency on taking a decision better than anything else
I've heard.

This, on the other hand, is a non sequitur [1], another type of fallacy.
Well, several of them, actually:

- If it's not raised, then bitcoin cannot become popular
- If it's not raised, then users will leave
- Businesses built on the assumption that Bitcoin could become popular
were also assuming that it's going to be risen.

These statements may even be true, but they're no logical conclusions
even if they seem obvious to you.
I don't think those claims are strictly true, specially because they
involve predictions about what people will do.
But if they're true they require some proof or at least some explanation.
