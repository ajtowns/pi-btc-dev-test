Well, I'm not fundamentally opposed to a blacklist, but it would have
to be done in a VERY open manner.  I do think the community would
agree that storing big data transactions is not the primary purpose of
bitcoin.

However, there should be some metrics and heuristics that take care of
this problem.  Notably the dev consensus (sans you, Mike :)) seems to
be that uneconomical outputs should be made non-standard.

Here is one approach:
    Block uneconomic UTXO creation
    https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2351

I would like to see at least a stopgap solution to data spam in 0.8.2,
as it is a clear and present problem.
