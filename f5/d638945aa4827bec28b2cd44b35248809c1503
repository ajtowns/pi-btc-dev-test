Sorry, I completely forgot about having submitted the BIP as I was busy at
this time.
Thanks for the review.

Open Asset is actually not an abandoned project and is a protocol already
used in production with multiple implementation.
Wallet: https://www.coinprism.com/
Implementation C#: https://github.com/NicolasDorier/NBitcoin with heavy
documentation (
https://programmingblockchain.gitbooks.io/programmingblockchain/content/other_types_of_asset/colored_coins.html
)
Implementation Ruby: https://github.com/haw-itn/openassets-ruby/
Usage stats: http://opreturn.org/

Concerning whether or not we can put my name in the BIP, I'll ask the
original author that I know personally.

Yes, with open asset it is not possible to do provably limited issuance.
The scriptPubKey can be anything, not necessarily P2PK.
If you can spend the scriptPubkey, then you are the issuer.

> And the assets attached to its inputs are destroyed? Or?

Correct, if you spend a colored output incorrectly, it is effectively
destroyed.

"valid"?

The terminology is correct we are parsing PUSHDATA, if there is a parsable
pushdata, the output is considered valid.
If there is multiple valid output, then we take the first one.

You can't issue more than one asset type in a transaction. (as the asset
issued is defined by the scriptPubKey of the first input)
For multiple transfer it is possible, imagine a transaction with the
following 3 inputs and 6 outputs:

Inputs: {0, 10a, 20b}
Outputs: {5, OP_RETURN; 7; 3; 11; 9)

Inputs1: 0
Inputs2: Enqueue 10a in the queue ( {10a} )
Input3: Enqueue 20b in the queue ( { 20b, 10a} )

Output1: Before OP_RETURN, so is issuance whose color is defined by the
scriptPubKey of Input1. (say c)
Output2: No color (marker)
Output3: Dequeue 7a ( {20b, 3a} ), color output with a.
Output4: Dequeue 3a ( {20b} ), color output with a
Output5: Dequeue 11b ( {9b} ), color output with b
Output5: Dequeue 9b ( {0} ), color output with b

Finally, outputs color are
Outputs: {5c, OP_RETURN; 7a; 3a; 11b; 9b)

Marker output is skipped (explained in the example)

Actually there is no "issuance address", just the AssetId is defined by the
scriptPubKey of the issuer.

Yes, it requires address reuse for issuing.

> Won't an older client then accidentally destroy assets?

Correct. Actually we prevent users sending asset to wallet which does not
support OA via another address scheme described in another document (
https://github.com/OpenAssets/open-assets-protocol/blob/master/address-format.mediawiki
)

As said, Open Asset is not a draft proposal and is already used in the wild
since 2014. We can't easily modify the protocol by now for improving it.

PS:
https://github.com/OpenAssets/open-assets-protocol/blob/master/specification.mediawiki
is
more readable than a mail.

Nicolas,
