Your usecase only makes sense if we assume that blocks are community property.

This is provably not the case, it has been proven with the recent spam attack, 
people could just continue sending their payments without issues by just 
increasing the fee a bit.

As such, the bigger blocks don't immediately get filled, it makes more space 
for everyone. People abusing it will also have to spend a lot more money (that 
goes to benefit the network as a whole) to disrupt it.
