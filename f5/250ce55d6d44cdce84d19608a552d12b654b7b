I put the page together a while ago with logical segregation of the current 
Bitcoin concept. wxBitcoin originally implemented the entire thing as one big 
blob. Miners got moved out first. Spesmilo took the next step of separating 
out a GUI. Wallet and node are currently tightly tied together in bitcoind, 
though it can function as only one of the two just as well. So in practice, it 
is fully possible to run it like that, but I'm not aware of any de facto use 
yet.

Generally, nodes need to make outbound connections too, at least to get 
started.

The miner can really get by with just an address from the wallet--
it needs somewhere to put its generated coins ;)

You can run a system-wide bitcoind (or equivalent) to handle p2p connectivity, 
and have each user run a dedicated wallet bitcoind (with the -connect option) 
with a unique JSON-RPC port (for Spesmilo) or wx GUI. I don't think there is 
any automated setup for this kind of arrangement. I personally foresee the p2p 
being implemented on a SOHO router as the end goal (or even better-- 
multicast).
