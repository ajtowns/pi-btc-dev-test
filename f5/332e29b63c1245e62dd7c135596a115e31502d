Agreed.

What you appear to want to say is that it is in everyones best interest to 
avoid short forks.
Its impossible to guarentee they can't happen, but very possible to minimize 
them.

No, there are no block-size-negotiations on chain.

The blockchain is used here for one purpose, to state the position of 
individual miners. But what may not be clear is that you can use this as a 
time-stamped way to hold them to it. Which means that if they lie (by 
rejecting a block), everyone in the world will be able to individually 
verify that fact and their credibility will be affected.

Which will not help their case next time any block size negotiations will 
happen.
