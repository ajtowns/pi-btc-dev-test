It is an overly-simplistic miner model to assume altruism is
necessary.  The hashpower market is maturing in the direction of
financial instruments, where the owner of the hashpower is not
necessarily the one receiving income.  These are becoming tradeable
instruments, and derivatives and hedging are built on top of that.
Risk is hedged at each layer.  Market players also forge agreements
with miners, and receive -negative- value if hashpower is simply shut
down.

Simplistic models cannot predict what hashpower does in the face of
business-to-business medium- and long-term contracts.
