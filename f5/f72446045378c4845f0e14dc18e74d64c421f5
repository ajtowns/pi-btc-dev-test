Really bad for privacy. Data for transactions at the tip is only
14kb/s-- potentially less if segwit is in use and you're not getting
witnesses. Is that really that burdensome?

FWIW, leaving a mobile browser just running while pointed at some
websites seems to use more traffic than that just loading advertising.
