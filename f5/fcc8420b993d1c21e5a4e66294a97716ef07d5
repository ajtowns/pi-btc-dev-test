Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Version 0.6 release candidate 5 binaries
Message-ID: <4F70FE62.8040807@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Barring any last-minute showstopper issues, the plan is for release
candidate 5 to become the official 0.6.0 release on Wednesday.

So please help look for last-minute showstopper issues:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.6.0/test/

The major changes from release candidate 4:

+ Much faster writing of blkindex.dat during initial blockchain
download (by modifying the default bdb environment cache settings)

+ A new policy for wallet.dat upgrades: use the old format unless the
user either uses a feature that requires an upgrade (encrypts the
wallet) or explicitly requests that the wallet be upgraded using the
new -upgradewallet option. New wallets will use new features (for 0.6,
the only new wallet feature is compressed public keys).

+ bugfix introduced in rc4 for an assertion failure that could occur
during blockchain reorganizations

+ New code for managing the addr.dat file that prevents an attacker
from filling it with bogus entries.
