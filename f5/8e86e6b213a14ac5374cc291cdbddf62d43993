Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Prenumbered BIP naming
Message-ID: <CAAS2fgRWKWMkzqpQDXJGJYZPyb+vTnaRs3jOrzQ-zG5JJyqr1Q@mail.gmail.com>

I've noticed some folks struggling to attach labels to their yet to be
numbered BIPs.

I'd recommend people call them "draft-<main author name>-<what it
does>" like draft-maxwell-coinburning in the style of pre-WG IETF
drafts.
