All of that only melds with the payment protocol under an extremely
expansive definition of "payment."  The payment protocol is really
geared towards a direct one-to-one relationship.

We can make the payment protocol do all this, if you squeeze and push
and try reall hard; it is mainly a question of protocol design and
intended usage:  is PP intended to be, ultimately, an expansive,
universal protocol for gossiping with other parties about bitcoin
transactions in a not-flood-fill manner?
