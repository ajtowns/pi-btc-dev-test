The real limit is set by the technology. Just like in 1990 we could not 
fathom having something like YouTube and high-res video streaming (Netflix), 
the limits of what is possible continually shifts.

This is basically how any successful product has ever grown, I think that it 
is not just desirable, it is inevitable.
