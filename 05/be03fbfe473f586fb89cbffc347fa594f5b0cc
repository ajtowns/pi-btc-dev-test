Message-ID: <20150428074414.GA19918@amethyst.visucore.com>

Hello all,

The release window for 0.11 is nearing, I'd propose the following schedule:

2015-05-01  Soft translation string freeze
            Open Transifex translations for 0.11
            Finalize and close translation for 0.9

2015-05-15  Feature freeze, string freeze

2015-06-01  Split off 0.11 branch
            Tag and release 0.11.0rc1
            Start merging for 0.12 on master branch 

2015-07-01  Release 0.11.0 final (aim)

In contrast to former releases, which were protracted for months, let's try to be more strict about the dates. Of course it is always possible for last-minute critical issues to interfere with the planning. The release will not be held up for features, though, and anything that will not make it to 0.11 will be postponed to next release scheduled for end of the year.

Wladimir
