This seems unnecessarily complicated ("don't use cannon to kill mosquito"
kind of thing). If the community were interested in a realtime hashrate
rebalancing proposal one could simply adjust difficulty at each new block
using the current method.

If faster relaxation in case of adversity is required, it suspect that it
would suffice to perform a weighted average of the previous 2016 blocks
instead of the standard averaging that is currently done. It should be
possible to find an optimal weighting based on historical interblock timing
data. I look into it over the next couple of days.
