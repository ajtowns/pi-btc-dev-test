I've changed the proposal so only 8 bits are given to grinding so something
like 20 bits are available for signaling.

I have to say I'm at a loss here as to what's next? Should I make a new BIP
or try to convince the authors of BIP141 to modify their BIP? Could someone
inform me on the next part of the process?
