Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Version 0.7 release planning
Message-ID: <CA+8xBpfeoNOte=GFGqAT7+4U+JCa4DP8CkEupe+oKdJL1dMFFQ@mail.gmail.com>

There seems to be consensus that we should go ahead and do a release,
before leveldb or ultraprune or anything major lands.  There is no
major landmark feature, but just a useful collection of small changes.
 It seems like a good time to Release Early, Release Often and make a
checkpoint release.

Some rough draft release notes were dumped in
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes.txt

Opening the floor...  What do we collectively want to happen, before
0.7 release?  What is the todo list for 0.7?

After cleaning out some pull requests yesterday, and looking at the
list today, I see

1) CreateNewBlock: Child-pays-for-parent / Add transaction fee later
luke-jr https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1647

2) Translations update 2012-08-01 (fetched from Transifex)
Diapolo https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1644

3) Add address groupings RPC from coderrr's coincontrol patches.
gmaxwell https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1642

4) Add 'mempool' P2P command, and extend 'getdata' behavior
jgarzik https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1641

5) PROBABLY NOT, BUT MAYBE: Relay blocks as a "preview" before
checking the transactions in them
luke-jr https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1586

6) JSON-RPC method: prioritisetransaction <txid> <priority delta>
luke-jr https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1583

7) HOPEFULLY: Addnode optimization and addnode access via RPC
BlueMatt https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1549

8) MAYBE: Transition to requiring block height in block coinbases
gavinandresen https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1526

9) WE MUST PICK ONE: RPC: lock push-down, preparing for
parallelization opportunities
jgarzik https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1494
    or
RPC: add facility to enable RPCs to run outside cs_main, wallet locks
jgarzik https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1493

10) I THINK WE WANT THIS?  Make IPv6 support optional again (defaults
to enabled)
luke-jr https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1431

11) MAYBE: getblocktemplate ('getmemorypool', post IRC debate)
luke-jr https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/936
