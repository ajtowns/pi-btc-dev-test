Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Make links on 'About Bitcoin Core' into
	clickable #4211
Message-ID: <8ED4B55B-E955-4F19-86B1-2155A7CD0EF0@gmail.com>

Hello,

I?m new to bitcoin, I?m a developer and I want to start contributing to the BitcoinQt project. My first contribution is to make the links on the ?About Bitcoin Core? clickable - personally I think it enhances the user experience. There is was some concern though of a tradeoff which makes it harder to translate that page. Here is the link to my pull request: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4211

I?m keen to hear what others think.
