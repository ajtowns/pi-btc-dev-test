Then are you willing to tell us what IP addresses your nodes connect
from? This is important network stability information due to how nodes
prevent a lack of diversity in their outgoing connections.

The Bitcoin P2P network's primary concern is reliability through
diversity; you are harming that resource.

So to be clear, you have both a high level of outgoing and incoming
connections? Given that Bitcoin nodes only connect to eight outgoing
peers, how do you manage to connect to your claimed 10%-20% of all
reachable nodes? Obviously you can't be doing that with just incoming
connections, unless you're running hundreds of nodes, or doing an addr
spamming attack.

It's actually marginally better for the network if you're using hundreds
of distinct nodes rather than just a few to do this sybil attack - the
chance of your small number of nodes suddenly going off-line and causing
propagation issues is more than hundreds of nodes all going off-line
suddenly. Additionally it's easier for bad actors to survail your few
internet connections to easily get tx propagation information from the
network than it is to survail Chainalysis's setup. (ironic I know)

"Control attempts"? Care to explain?

Re: "gatekeeping" - fact is your business model and technology can only
be succesfully run by a small number of entities at once, resulting in a
situation where those few companies act as gatekeepers for access to
zeroconf confirmation probability information.

Nice cheap shot there. My "relationships" are nothing more than people
being willing to talk to me, ask me for advice, and warn me about
possible threats. They're not legal contracts.
