Facebook has a LevelDB fork which is maintained.
It's called RocksDB and the API seems to be nearly the same as for LevelDB,
thus maybe easy to replace: http://rocksdb.org/
https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb

Although I don't know if we might have some negative effects for our
use-case since RocksDB was optimized for big databases running on multiple
cores.
