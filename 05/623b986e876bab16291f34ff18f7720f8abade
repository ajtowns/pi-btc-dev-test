This is a bad idea. The bitcoin protocol is (mostly) stateless. Stateless protocols are more secure.

If there is a reasonable use for it, I have no objections.

However: the bitcoin P2P protocol is not fully request-reply based, and trying to use
it that may be be less intuitive than how it looks. For example, doing a second
identical "getblocks" request will not result in more "inv" replies, as the client
prevents retransmits. This is not a large problem, but maybe such an extension
should also include an extra "denied" message, which is sent if the client is
unwilling to answer (and may also be used to report transactions that are not
accepted into the memory pool, for example).
