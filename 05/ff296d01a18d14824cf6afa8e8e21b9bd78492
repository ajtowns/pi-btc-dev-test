We used to have a WIKI page for all the BIP stuff and that worked
better IMO, the use of git(hub) for it was a step forward in a number
of ways but made the number assignment part an odd duck. We should
have fixed it then, but it wasn't obvious (enough) that it needed
fixing at the time. Live and learn.
