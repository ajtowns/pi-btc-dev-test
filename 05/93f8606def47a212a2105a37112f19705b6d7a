I see the advantage here. But there is a major problem here.

We came up with BIP44 so a wallet can claim it is BIP44 compatible and
you can be 100% sure that you can migrate accounts from one wallet
implementation to another. This was not previously possible when a
wallet claimed it is BIP32 compatible.

Now we have a similar problem. When there is a BIP44 wallet, does it
mean it supports segwit or not? For this reason I would like to see
another BIPXX for segwit, so a wallet can claim it is BIP44, BIP44+BIPXX
or BIPXX compatible and you'll know what other wallets are compatible
with it.
