There was a discussion about using DHT's for transactions a while back
on the forums:
?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=723.msg7908#msg7908

If you can figure out a scheme that is secure from malicious Sybil
attacks then you're smarter than I am.

And additional protocol messages for lightweight clients is a good
idea, as long as they don't make it a lot easier to pull off a
denial-of-service attacks on a "full" node.

Although I do also wonder if we'll ever run into a problem with full
nodes refusing to answer requests from lightweight nodes (there might
be a tragedy-of-the-commons problem lurking there).
