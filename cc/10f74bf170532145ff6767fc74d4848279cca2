Mark,
It took you 3 minutes to respond to my e-mail. And I responded to you 4
minutes later. If you had responded to me in 10 minutes, I would be of out
the office and we wouldn't have this dialogue. So 5 minutes is a lot of
time.

Obviously this is not a technical response to the technical issues you
argue. But "minutes" is a time scale we humans use to measure time very
often.

:)
