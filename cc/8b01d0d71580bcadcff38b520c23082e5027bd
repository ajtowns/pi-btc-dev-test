What annoys me are people that seem to think that in order to promote
layer two scaling on-chain scaling has to be severely limited. I am
convinced that in order for layer 2 to flourish enough on-chain
bandwidth has to be available, not artificial scarceness.
In order to allow more on-chain bandwidth also sharding solutions should
be investigated so not every transactions has to pass through each node
and without the need of channels but protocol between nodes.

greets,
Staf.
