You're right that this is a simple electronic voting scheme. The thing
is that cryptographers are working on e-voting for decades and the idea
to use homomorphic commitments (or encryption) and zero-knowledge
proofs is not new in this area. It's rather the case that e-voting
inspired a lot of work on homomorphic crypto and related zero-knowledge 
proofs. For example, range proofs are overkill in e-voting. You just
need to ensure that the sum of all my votes (over all candidates) is 1.
 
E-voting protocols typically require some "bulletin board", where
ballots are stored. A blockchain could indeed be helpful in specific
cases (but not in all cases)...

If you're interested in that stuff, I'd suggest you to read some
literature about e-voting. (For example, 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08064 looks interesting for the connection
to blockchains -- I haven't read it though). There are pretty
sophisticated protocols in the literature. And I think that this
mailing list may not be the best place to discuss these.

Best,
Tim
