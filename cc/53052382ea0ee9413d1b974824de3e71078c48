No.  We should accept that reality may change, and we should promote
understanding of that fact.

We should not artificially manipulate the market "as soon as possible,"
since we ourselves don't know much at all about how the market will
unfold in the future.

Right, purely these.  There is no place for artificially manipulating
expectations.

Bitcoin has all the hash power.  The merkle root has effectively
infinite capacity.  We should be asking HOW to scale the supporting
information propagation system appropriately, not WHEN to limit the
capacity of the primary time-stamping machine.

We haven't tried yet.  I can't answer for the people you asked, but
personally I haven't thought much about when we should declare failure.
