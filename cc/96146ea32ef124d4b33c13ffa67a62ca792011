Regardless of whether this is a good idea or not in general, it won't
work in the case of Gentoo (and similar source-based distributions)
because Gentoo doesn't distribute software - they distribute
instructions which allow end users to download, compile, and install
software (ebuilds).

On my system I can compile a modified Firefox that still calls itself
"Firefox" by setting USE="-bindist". This would put Gentoo in
violation of Mozilla's trademarks if they were distributing that
modified version, but they aren't, so they're not. They just
distribute the instructions that tells my copy of Portage how to
compile the modified version. As long as I don't distribute the
modified binaries I compiled, then neither am I violating Mozilla's
trademarks.

tl;dr: The trademarking approach is only effective with regards to
binary distributions, not source-based distributions.
