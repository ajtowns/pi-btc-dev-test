I understand that Gavin has spent effort on security efforts against
small-scale attackers. It's the fact that he is so dismissive of the
threat that large attackers play that is what bothers me. But if I am
being divisive I understand.

I posted a clarification of what the reward is for exactly on the
forums: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=179612.msg1881800#msg1881800
