Thanks for getting this started, Luke.

Noticeably absent here is the "default_witness_commitment" key, as
added by the current reference implementation[0].

I assume (please correct me if I'm wrong) that this has been omitted
for the sake of having clients create the commitment themselves as
opposed to having it provided to them.

I don't think that the two approaches (providing the default
commitment for the complete tx set as well as the ability to create it
from chosen transactions) are at odds with each-other, rather it
merely allows for a simpler approach for those who are taking tx's
as-is from bitcoind. It's obviously important for the clients to be
able to chose tx's and create commitments as they desire, but it's
equally important to allow for simpler use-cases.

The issue in particular here is that a non-trivial burden is thrust
upon mining software, increasing the odds of bugs in the process. I'd
like to point out that this is not a theoretical argument. I've
already fixed a handful of bugs relating to serialization or
commitment creation in the mining/pool software that I've worked on
for segwit [1][2][3][4]. Asking them to handle more serialization and
calculation of complex structures needlessly increases the complexity
for zero benefit in the case where the tx's are to be used as-is.

I'll PR this change to the BIP, as I can't really come up with an
argument against. At worst, it can simply be ignored.
