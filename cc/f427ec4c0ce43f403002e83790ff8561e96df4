Indeed, I want to include a version number in the seed phrase because 
there are
multiple ways to define the tree structure used with BIP32. It is 
certainly too early
to make final decisions on that, or to achieve a common standard.
Also, I can imagine that bip32 itself might be superseeded in the future.

I understand that encapsulating a version number in the seed phrase might
not be as important for other wallets as it is for Electrum. So it is 
probably not
necessary to propose another BIP for that. I will simply implement it 
for Electrum,
and I will try to do it in such a way that other wallets can use the 
same format.

The other question we might be solving is strenghtening (your proposal). 
I consider
that this is not a strong requirement for Electrum, because it does not 
let the user
choose their seed phrase. However, if a few bits of the seed phrase are 
allocated
for metadata, then I guess strenghtening can be part of it. That's 
another good
reason to have a version number encapsulated in the seed.

I too wonder why the transformation needs to be bidirectional in bip39.
