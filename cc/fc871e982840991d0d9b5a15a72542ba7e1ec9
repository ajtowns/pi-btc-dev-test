Hello again,

sorry, got a bit derailed on that proposal.
But now I think its time to work on it again.

- Any objections to get a BIP-number for it? 
	If not, can I get one, so I can finish up the test vectors.
	Current version: https://github.com/DanielWeigl/bips/blob/master/bip-p2sh-accounts.mediawiki 

- I decided against extending it for future P2WPKH addresses
	I think that should be a separate account on its own, to reduce implementation work 
	for future wallets, that only want/need to implement P2WPKH accounts. And to keep it simple.
	Was someone working on the P2WPKH address format in the meantime? (ie. alternative for [2])

- We will also need a extension to the BIP32 serialization format[1]
	It should be possible to export/import a xPriv/xPub key across compatible wallets, and they
	should be able without guesswork, fuzzy checks or asking the user to import the correct account type.
	Thinking about some flexible tag-based backwards compatible extensions - but thats a different BIP in itself.


Cheers,
Daniel
