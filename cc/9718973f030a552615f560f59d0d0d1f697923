It is simpler than that; simple numbers.  Bitcoin is volatile right
now, not for fundamental architecture reasons, but for reasons why
many other small issues are volatile.  Low liquidity and a small issue
implies that a single big player can easily the move the market.
Further, it is volatile because common financial tools available
elsewhere -- shorting, futures/options, etc. -- are not widely and
easily available.

None of these factors are special or specific to bitcoin.  See
http://garzikrants.blogspot.com/2013/11/solution-to-bitcoin-volatility.html

However, this is getting WAY off-topic for a development mailing list.

Ryan successfully trolled the list.  Let's not further feed the trolls.
