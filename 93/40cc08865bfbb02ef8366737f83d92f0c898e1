Remember how I started off by asking what was the correct strategy if a
miner wanted to get more blocks than their *competition*, not more
blocks in total. In some scenarios that strategy is the one that
maximizes returns, such as the case when you make your returns from
transaction fees, especially without a blocksize limit restricting how
many fee paying transactions you can stuff in your blocks. It's not
correct to say the cabal is trying to maximize immediate revenue.

As for the length of those secret chains, at every step you of course
want to weigh the value of the blocks you have found against the risk
that someone else catches up, and when it makes sense, publish some or
all.
