The rationale of "backwards compatibility" is well known, yet wrong. I've

Eric - no, it's not sophisticated humour. I've been objecting to soft forks

There is no consensus. Now pick. Lose the requirement that everyone agree
for consensus changes, and tell people you've done it. Change the spec. Or
do nothing.
