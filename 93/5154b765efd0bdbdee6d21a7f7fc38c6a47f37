"High" is relative.

I could make a 100BTC apparently sacrifice via fees by just waiting a
month or two for my mining hardware to find a block that had a
pre-prepared fake sacrifice. It'd cost me roughly 1BTC when you take
orphans into account. Similarly I could hack into a pool and have them
do it on my behalf, or a pool could just offer the service for a fee.

I already worry enough that announce-commit sacrifices to mining fees
aren't secure enough given the potential of a few large pools teaming
up to create them cheaply, let alone what you're talking about...


Hey Luke: so what's the going rate to get Eligius to mine a fake mining
fee sacrifice? Can I get a discount on repeat orders? :)
