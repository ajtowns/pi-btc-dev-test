What problem are you trying to solve?

The reason why BIP62 (as specified, it is just a draft) does not make v1
transactions invalid is because it is opt-in. The creator of a transaction
needs to agree to protect it from malleability, and this subjects him to
extra rules in the creation.

Forcing v3 transactions would require every piece of wallet software to be
changed.
