Thanks.

You know, looking though your writeup, I think we're talking past each
other. I've found with a lot of other projects a good way to start is to
explicitly list what you think Factom *prevents* from happening. It is
after all security software - the most important thing it does is what
it prevents the attacker from doing. Be specific - you really need to
nail down exactly what kind of guarantees you're trying to get out of
the Factom system.
