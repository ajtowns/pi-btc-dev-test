Not that I know how to do this, but would you be willing to attempt some
other method of measuring just how much of a "super-majority" we have
before deploying code?  Maybe that information would be helpful for
everyone.  Obviously such a poll couldn't be perfect, but maybe better than
the information we have now.

A) I don't believe we should consider changing the 1 MB limit now
B) I conceptually believe in increasing block size, but would like to
follow a more conservative process and wait to see if a stronger technical
consensus on a plan to do so can develop.
C) I'd like to go along with Gavin and Mike's 8MB proposal (maybe we wait
til this is fully specified, but again not deployed)

Perhaps there can even be 4 polls:
Miners can vote in coinbases
Known corporate entities can announce their vote
Does the Bitcoin Foundation infrastructure still exist to represent some
authenticated (I think) set of individuals
A reddit poll

I don't even know if I think this is a good idea, but just trying to find a
way to move forward where more of us are on the same page.
