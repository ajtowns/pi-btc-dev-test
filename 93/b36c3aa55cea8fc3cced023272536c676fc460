Strongly with Peter on this.  That its highly complex to maintain strict
consensus between bitcoin versions, does not justify consensus rewrite
experiments; it tells you that the risk is exponentially worse and people
should use and rally around libconsensus.

I would advise any bitcoin ecosystem part, wallet, user to not use software
with consensus protocol rw-writes nor variants, you WILL lose money.

You could view bitcoin as a digital signature algorithm speculatively
tinkering with the algo is highly prone to binary failure mode and
unbounded funds loss.

Want to be clear this is not a political nor emotive issue. It is a
critical technical requirement for security if users of software people
write.

Please promote this meme.
