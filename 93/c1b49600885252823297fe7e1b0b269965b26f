Another concern is sourceforge being attacked and a backdoored client uploaded.
Most people don't check signatures and I seem to recall sourceforge having some
vulnerabilities stemming from their "your own website on sourceforge" feature.
It looks like Github takes security a little bit more seriously.
Probably the best is to ask for free hosting from a reputable security conscious
bitcoin enthusiast but that basically means Tux and he's already an SPOF in the
coineverse.

Thanks,
Caleb
