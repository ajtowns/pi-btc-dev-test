As a matter of procedure we do not use assertions with side effects? the
codebase did at one point, but have cleaned them up.  In an abundance of
caution we also made it refuse to compile without assertions enabled: A
decision who's wisdom was clearly demonstrated when not long after, some
additional side-effect having assert was contributed. In the real world
errors happen here and there, and making robust software involves defense
in depth.

Considering the normal criticality of the software it should always be with
the assertions. Without them is an untested configuration.  It would
probably be superior to use our own assertion macros (for one, they can
give some better reporting?) that don't have the baggage ordinary
assertions have, but as a the codebase is a production thing, making larger
changes all at once to satisfy aesthetics would be unwise... simply
refusing to compile in that untested, unsupported configuration is prudent,
for the time being.
