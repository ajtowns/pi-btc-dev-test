I don't understand how your proposal will work for decentralized pools -
can you explain it more concretely?

What would the new block header look like?

What is required for a share to to be earned?

What is required for a block to be valid (added to Block Chain)?

I don't think I understand what you mean by NextBlockCandidate.  Perhaps a
concrete example using difficulty 1.7 million would be instructive.
