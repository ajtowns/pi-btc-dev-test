>From the mining perspective, the unpatched install might not be simply wedged: 
it will also follow a competing smaller blockchain. An attacker could have 
used this exploit against a number of large miners (say about 40% or so) and 
exchanges to pull off any number of double-spend attacks until the miners 
noticed they had been forked and fixed their bitcoind. That is, the attacker 
could easily hijack as much of the miners has he wanted for his own purposes 
including phony 6+ confirmation transactions. On a more subtle level, the 
attacker could target certain blocks they wanted orphans by performing this 
attack on a majority of miners with the "tip" block he wanted orphaned.

This vulnerability is also the reason why Eloipool (the software behind 
Eligius, EclipseMC, TripleMining, and other pools) has attempted to produce 
blocks with only transaction counts that are powers of two; such blocks cannot 
be used for an attack even against vulnerable clients.
