Hard to predict or not, you can't force people to run newer software.

When you introduce anti-features like this in free software they can
be trivially removed and they likely will.

There's a simpler solution for this which is what is being done now:
stop maintaining and giving support for older versions.
There's limited resources and developers are rarely interested in
fixing bugs for very old versions. Users shouldn't expect things to be
backported to old versions (if developers do it and there's enough
testing, there's no reason not to do more releases of old versions, it
is just rarely the case).
