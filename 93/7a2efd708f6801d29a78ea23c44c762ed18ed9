Thank you for all your comments. I will improve the BIP based on the
technical suggestions received.

On the subjective/political side that has slipped into this discussion.
Skip this part if not interested in politics.

Regarding the timeline, its certainly rather short, but also is the UASF
BIP 148 ultimatum.

If Bitcoin were a democracy and we had somehow a way to securely perform a
referendum, then this will solve easily. But neither is true. At least now.

More than 80% of the miners and many users are willing to go in the
Segwit2x direction. With the support and great talent of the Bitcoin Core
developers, Segwit2x activation will not cause any major disruptions.
Without Core, there will be a temporary split. Both sides will have to
hard-fork.

I want a Bitcoin united. But maybe a split of Bitcoin, each side with its
own vision, is not so bad.
