I recall chatting about this idea recently and my conclusion was the same
as Peter Todd's conclusion: this will just encourage miners to false signal
readiness with undermines both BIP 9 and BIP 8.

I felt that rather than using script system for this construction, it would
be better to use the transaction version number instead by soft-forking in
a rule that says when the most significant bits of a transaction version
are 001 then the transaction can only be included in blocks whose lower 29
version bits are set at the same position as the lower 29 version bits set
in the transaction version.

That is to say, if we have block version blkVersion and transaction version
txVersion, we soft fork in a rule that requires that

(txVersion & 0xe0000000 != 0x020000000) || ((blkVersion & 0xe0000000 =
0x020000000) && (blkVersion & txVersion = txVersion))

While I think that making use of the transaction version number is superior
to adding an opcode, because it doesn't interfere with caching of script
validity and because it doesn't use any more transaction space by making
use of the otherwise useless transaction version number, I still think it
is a bad proposal.
