Agreed. I would just like that there was an attempt to automatically
estimate those risks before taking those risks.
Some function we're trying to optimize with simulations (based on
#6382 ) to find an ideal (according to that imperfect metric) maximum
consensus block size.
Maybe the function/simulations just take some minimum hardware
specifications and returns an block size, I don't know.

The most important thing to understand in this discussion is that it
is about a trade-off between lower fees (more maximum tx volume) and
mining (and general) centralization.
I don't know what the costs and gains curves are here (for 4MB, 1 MB
or any other number, and I don't think anybody does).
But if we can't even agree on what the advantages and disadvantages of
increasing the consensus block size maximum, it is very hard that we
can agree on a universally acceptable point or range in this trade-off
rect.

This is all probably right, but IMO we're very far away from $5/tx.
My main point about fees is that minimum mining fees rising above zero
(theri current level) is not necessarily a bad thing or an urgent
concern.
On the other hand, we have much more data about current mining
centralization, which should be very relevant information when
discussing a block size increase.

As Pieter has explained repeatedly, a big block count is not a goal in
itself, just a metric.
And if you ask me, I don't think it's all that interesting as a
metric. For all I know there could be a lot more full nodes being run
that for whatever reason are not seen by people collecting this data.
The block size maximum consensus rule limits mining centralization,
not just full node centralization. Gavin, for example, disagrees with
this.
Fortunately I believe at least 2 mathematical proofs can be produced
to demonstrate Gavin and those who think like him are wrong.

I believe that even with the relay network, and even assuming all
miners are connected using something like IBLT, a mathematical proof
can be constructed to demonstrate that bigger block sizes can prevent
the worse connected miners from being profitable.
It is important to note that the worse connected miners aren't
necessarily those with less bandwidth: maybe you have the best
bandwidth but you are poorly connected to the majority of the hashrate
(for example, because the majority of the hashrate is within the same
country but that country is not very well connected to the rest of the
world).

We're certainly far away from this being a concern in practice.
But I'm working on a mathematical proof that at some scale CPU
requirements could become a discriminating factor making the smallest
mining operations unprofitable.

I don't think there's such a thing as a "dangerous full node count level".
It's just data that can be useful to build centralization metrics.
Probably hashrate distribution by pool is much more interesting (and
if you ask me that looks really bad right now without increasing the
block size consensus maximum).

I agree.

Great. I don't think that minimum mining fees will rise above 1 usd
cent/tx anytime soon even if we maintain the limit of 1MB.
Maybe that's why I'm not worried at all about "hitting the limit".
But I'm sorry, I don't have those concrete numbers because it is a
trade-off I don't think we've studied in enough detail.
Well, I can also say I wouldn't be worried at all about moving to,
say, 1.01 MB (because the difference in centralization pressure should
be minimal) and I would just take it as a "let's proof hardforks are
possible" change similar to the one proposed in bip99.

That would be interesting to read and I have totally missed it.
Do you have a link?

And for any size something similar could happen with some use case.
But this is a great example of a situation where I would understand
people panicking and clamoring to change the consensus rule as soon as
possible.
Even with much lower fees, say 1 usd/tx.
I think it would be a great problem to have and admittedly I'm not
worried about having it in the short term.
And if it happened overnight we could always deploy an emergency hardfork.

I think it's helping by determining who is to be served first, and
that is those who benefit more from Bitcoin (and are therefore willing
to pay higher costs for using it), in this case, people doing
international remittances.

Agreed.

This is what I mean by "market minimum fee".

I think the code that miners use to select which transactions to
include first needs a lot of work.
As said miners are subsidizing free transactions, increasing their own
costs for nothing in exchange.
Also, yes, there is something special about this market: it is
supposed to pay for most of the global hashrate in the not-so-far
future.
If we take too long to start moving away from total seigniorage
subsidy dependence, it may be too late when we do.

I think you are underestimating the software costs.
And you not only have to adapt the software that we have now, but also
the software that hasn't been written yet and will be written assuming
free transactions and an underdeveloped market.
Also you are over-estimating the costs: you could hit the limit but
then rise the block size maximum as soon as you reach, say 0.00001
usd/tx.
Even if minimum fees go again to zero after rising the block size
maximum, the software improvements will remain there.

And when do you think "Bitcoin will need to rely heavily on txn fees
for security"?
How many more halvings is that?

That's not what I've been arguing, I've just being saying that I would
be completely ok with minimum fees rising above zero (say, to 1
satoshi/tx) tomorrow.
I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing (in fact, it has some
advantages) and certainly not something we should fear to the point of
rushing hardforks to avoid it.
