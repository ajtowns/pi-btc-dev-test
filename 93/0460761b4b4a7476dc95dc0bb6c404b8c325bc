Furthermore, the actual way in which the conflict is resolved sets a precedent for how such disagreements are to be ?resolved? in the future.

So the means are also important to consider.

The best answer is that they are incentivized to not override a minority group since that reduces the inherent value in the system. However, presuming that the majority calculate that the reward for imposing a change is greater than the value lost in such disruption, I don't see how there would be any stopping this change. The longest chain with the greatest number of users valuing the token on that chain "wins".
