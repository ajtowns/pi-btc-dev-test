To clarify, because the 95% of upgraded hashing power is creating valid
blocks from the point of view of the remaining 5%, that 95% majority
will continually reorg the 5% non-upgrading chain. This ensures that the
invalid chain remains short, and thus the # of invalid confirmations
possible remains small. For instance, the chance of getting one invalid
confirmation is 0.05^1 = 5%, two invalid confirmations 0.05^2 = 0.25%, three
0.05^3 = 0.01% etc.

Whereas with a hard fork, the 5% of miners will continue mining on their
own chain. While that chain's length will increase more slowly than
normal, the # of confirmations that non-upgraded clients will see on it
are unbounded.


Anyway, we should write this up as a BIP - there's been a tremendous
amount of misinformation, even flat out lies, floating around on this
subject.
