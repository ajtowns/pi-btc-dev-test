PLEASE.

For those of us that prefer the reference software and also manage
multiple wallets, having to store a copy of the blockchain for each one
eats up disk space quite quickly.  If I could run a local blockchain
server (or a local network one, even) and then have whichever wallet I
start up use that instead of maintain its own copy of the blockchain, my
world would be much, much happier.

Sandboxing keys and sensitive wallet data away from the attack surface
introduced by the network interfaces into another separate process is
also a good security move.  Don't forget to sanitize your IPC inputs (:

Thanks,
