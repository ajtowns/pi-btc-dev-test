Transactions message sole purpose is to allow easy signing of all 
transactions
i don't think you can serialise a single field
maybe i missed something, not sure

I'll get back to the list with something tomorrow, 
can be useful in the BIP as an example anyway I guess.

maybe in some different scheme of "instantness" that could be useful, 
although i wonder if it's possible to keep the BIP simple with 
such non immediately obvious use cases.

another PKI, not sure, I understand there are already somewhat weak industry 
schemes to revoke.
I do wonder if there's any better and more "future proof" way.
I'll think about it but for now I hope someone with more experience can 
share some insight.
