As was discussed on the weekly meeting [0], turns out it *is* less
restrictive than current policy. IsStandardTx currently returns a failure
if the tx version is greater than 1, and per BIP68, nSequence will only
be inforced with tx version of 2 or greater.

So afaics, BIP 65 (OP_CLTV), BIP 68 (nSequence) and BIP 112 (OP_CSV)
are all "safe soft forks", and if activated won't cause SPV nodes to
see a significant uptick in reorgs, double-spends etc. (They'll still
be vulnerable to people deliberately spending hashpower to mine invalid
blocks, but that's a problem at any point, independent of whether a
soft-fork is underway)
