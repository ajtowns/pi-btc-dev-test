Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Standardizing automatic pre-negotiation of
 transaction terms with BIP70? (Emulating Amazon one-click purchase at all
 merchants)

BIP70 is a protocol for getting a user's wallet client communicate with a
merchant's server in order to agree on details like where to send the
payment, how much to send, what the shipping address is, sending a receipt
back, and much more using various extensions that adds more functionality.

There could even be advanced functionality for automatically negotiating
terms. One example could be selecting a multisignature arbitrator both
sides trust. Another could be to agree on the speed and type of delivery.
Many more types of decisions could be automatically agreed upon.

But as it is now, it is designed to be initiated at the time of payment. If
you always want next-day delivery from online stores then you won't always
know if that's an option until you've filled the digital basket and gone
through checkout. If you only want to shop with an arbitrator involved same
thing applies.

Everything that BIP70 enables happens at the last step only, as it is right
now.

If there could be a BIP70 HTML tag on web shops that automatically
triggered your wallet as soon as you visit the page, it would be possible
for a browser extension that talks to your wallet to tell you right away if
the web shop you're currently looking at has terms you consider acceptable
or not (note: if your wallet client isn't installed on or linked to that
same machine, a visible Qr code would be an acceptable alternative which
you can scan in advance before you start shopping). This notification can
even be automatically updated as you add and remove things from your cart
and details like shipping options change.

This would massively simplify the shipping experience and make every web
shop feel like Amazon.

Of course this has privacy implications and increases exposure to potential
wallet exploits, but the wallet can ask you if you intend to shop or not at
each site before it even connects and send any information at all in order
to mitigate both of those problems. This way it should be reasonably safe.

Another option would be to automatically connect but limit what data is
sent in order to remain privacy preserving, until the user agrees to send
private information.

This second method would also open up for the merchant to other send
relevant information such as details about various certifications from
third parties, which can include a certification that shows they have been
been audited and approved by by entity X for purpose Y. If your wallet has
that entity whitelisted it will show you that certificate (for example
"Acme Audits have audited and approves of Merchant M's privacy policy and
data protection"). With a list of predefined types of certifications that
the wallet understand and accepts, it could (by choice of the user) require
a certificate to be present to even allow you to make a purchase (lack of
required certifications would result in automatic denial). No certificate =
your wallet never proceed to send private information.

Thoughts?
