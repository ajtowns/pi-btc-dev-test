Hello,

I'm not sure if anyone has submitted a request for gmane to monitor and 
archive this new list, but I did. Maybe it's not best for many people to 
re-request that? For those who aren't aware, gmane has a nice HTTP/HTML 
archive as well as a newsgroup proxy that is also very nice for reading 
the archive. They'll also subscribe the list to mail-archive.com for you.

I've also noticed that gmane 
(http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bitcoin.devel) does not have exactly 
the same archive for the old bitcoin-development list 
(http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/bitcoin-development/). It's 
missing a few months at the beginning. The new list archive does contain 
the same thing as the old list 
(https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/).

gmane has an option to import old archives, so I'm seeing if they can do 
that with the https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/ 
list, since it is complete. In order to avoid confusion on what list is 
the most complete, if they can, I may request them delete or rename 
their old, incomplete archive at 
http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bitcoin.devel . It's possible they could 
even make this new list use that same name after deleting or renaming 
that old archive.


There is also bitcoin-list 
(http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/bitcoin-list/). I think that 
one may be discontinued? That list appears to be older and contains some 
of Satoshi's original e-mails. On gmane though 
(http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bitcoin.user), it is missing the first 
few years of archives. Do we want to try and preserve this historical 
correspondence on any way before sourceforce disappears?




Regarding message footers and the subject prefix of [bitcoin-dev], it 
would be cool if mailman allowed people to change this on a per-user basis.
