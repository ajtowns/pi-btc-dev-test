Without significant effort, I don't think we're going to be able to get
that number down. I'd like to stress that without making these non-standard
encodings effectively invalid on the network, pretty much every full node
implementation needs to depend on OpenSSL to guarantee compatibility (and
that is hoping OpenSSL doesn't change its supported encodings), or make
assumptions about which deviations are allowed.

The next question, I guess, is at which transaction frequency it's
acceptable to move forward with this? The first step is definitely just not
accepting them into memory pools, but leaving them valid inside blocks.
Actual network rules will need to come later. However, even just not
accepting them into memory pools will it make very hard (if not impossible)
for the buggy clients that create transactions to get any confirmations.
I'm not sure... 0.6% isn't much, but 9600 transactions is.
