Dear Paul,

I may very well have confused who counts what, but for this discussion on *theft* it's irrelevant, so I won't push further on this.

Let's move on to the theft.

To be crystal clear: I am entirely uninterested in the un-upgraded nodes, what you call [DC#0].

They are irrelevant to my argument.

> In the second case, it so happens that [DC#1], [DC#2], and [DC#3] would also accept any WT^ *that followed the Drivechain rules*, even if they did not like the outcome (because the outcome in question was arbitrarily designated as a "theft" of funds -- again, see the second case in the list above). In this way, it is exactly similar to P2SH because nodes will accept *any* p2sh txn **that follows the p2sh rules**, even if they don't "like" the specific script contained within (for example, because it is a theft of "their" BitFinex funds, or a donation to a political candidate they dislike, etc).

This is false.

For miners to steal P2SH funds, the P2SH script would have to be coded to explicitly allow them to do it.

How many P2SH scripts are you aware of that are used for the purpose of facilitating such theft?

I know of none, and I bet there are none.

Whereas in DC, every single usage of DC allows miners to steal funds.

>> In P2SH, all upgraded nodes will reject invalid P2SH transactions, period.
> 
> In DC, all upgraded nodes will reject invalid DC transactions, period.

It appears you are playing games with the meaning of "invalid" here, so that sentence is invalid.

I was very clear what I meant by "invalid" in my email: WT^ transactions that represent miners stealing funds. Please stick to that and do not play word games.

> The [DC#2] and [DC#3] nodes would do exactly what the [DC#0] and [DC#1] nodes do. This is what I mean by "every withdrawal is valid".

So, here you are again re-affirming that WT^ transactions representing stolen funds are allowed in DC, and by tying them all together you are also affirming that the SPV proofs mentioned in DC are completely irrelevant / pointless / unused.

>> Again, in P2SH miners cannot steal funds, because all full nodes have a fully automatic enforcement policy.

So in the first sentence you say they "cannot steal funds", but everything else you've said, including the following paragraph, and your specification, indicates they can.

I've finally collected all my thoughts / concerns and have also summarized them in this document:
