Luke,
I previously explored an extra state to require signalling before activation in an earlier draft of BIP8, but the overall impression I got was that gratuitous orphaning was undesirable, so I dropped it. I understand the motivation behind it (to ensure miners are upgraded), but it's also rather pointless when miners can just fake signal. A properly constructed soft fork is generally such that miners have to deliberately do something invalid - they cannot be tricked into it... and miners can always chose to do something invalid anyway.
