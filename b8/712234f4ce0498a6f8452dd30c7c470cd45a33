Lol, interesting mistake I made w/ Coinbase: my mobile wallets are all setup in
ways that don't support the payment protocol w/ Coinbase, probably because come
to think of it they were (still are?) rejecting payment protocol requests over
proxies and Tor. And on my desktop setups payment protocol URLs don't work for
various reasons, and I'd forgotten I'd manually disabled them ages ago.

Just checked and Bitfinex, BTCC, and Shapeshift all don't seem to use the
payment protocol.

Other than BitPay and Coinbase, do you have an example of a service supporting
the payment protocol?

User-to-user payments pretty much always use naked addresses.
