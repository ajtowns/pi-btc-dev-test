I understand the mechanics of a tunnel between trusting parties that have a secure side channel. But this assumes that no other peer can connect to these two nodes. How then do they maintain the chain?

The "middle" in this sense does not have to be the wire directly between these two peers. It can be between either of them and any anonymous connection they (must) allow.

Of course this creates pressure to expand their tunnel. Hence the problem of expanding node identity in an effort to preserve privacy. The protection will remain weak until the entire network is "secure". At that point it would necessarily be a private network.

As Pieter rightly observes, there are and always will be tunnels between trusting nodes. Often these are groups of nodes that are in collaboration, so logically they are one node from a system security standpoint. But if people become generally reliant on good node registration, it will become the registrar who controls access to the network. So my concern rests I this proposal becoming widely adopted.
