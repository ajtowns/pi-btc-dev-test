Adam,

Take a look at this privacy enhancing solution based on fair exchange 
implemented by bitcoin contracts and cut-and-choose. It would require a 
public pool of users willing to exchange in common denominations at 
moments in time together to ensure unlinkability. It also leave a trace 
of exchange activity in the chain. This could all be added to wallet 
software to become automatic.
