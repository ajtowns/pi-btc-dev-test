Adam, I think he means a multisig escrow transaction where the escrow
is trusted by both parties, and other examples like that.
But I don't see how that is relevant, allowing trust to be involved in
different ways is a feature, but it's optional.
I think the point "you don't need to trust anyone to use Bitcoin" remains.
