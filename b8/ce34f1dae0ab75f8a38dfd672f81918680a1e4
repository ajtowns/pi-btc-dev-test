I didn't talked about how fast miners would upgrade, please read again
because I believe I was extremely precise.
In both cases I'm assuming there's a minority of the hasrate which
doesn't upgrade.
In the softfork case, the minority will always build on top of the
longest chain (which is valid to them). There may be many little
alternative chains that are ignored (and orphaned) by the upgraded
miners, but non-upgraded miners will always build on top of the
longest chain.

In the hardfork case, non-upgraded miners will reject the upgraded
chain because it is invalid to them, so they will build on top of the
longest non-upgraded chains.
Two alternative chains will continue growing forever unless the
non-upgraded miners eventually upgrade.
In contrast, there won't be 2 alternative chains growing forever in
the softfork case even if the minority miners never upgrade.

BIP99 recommends an uncontroversial softfork for this kind of case.
You seem to be contradicting BIP99 in many other places. Maybe you
want to complain about some of the recommendations in BIP99 (instead
of everywhere else):

You seem to be the only one who thinks that softforks have "numerous
downsides" over hardforks.
So everybody just basically disagrees with the assumption in your
question and thus nobody can answer it.
