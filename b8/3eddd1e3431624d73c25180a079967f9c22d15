That's basically what appears to have happened with Mt. Gox.

Preventing the attack is as simple as training your customer service
people to ask the customer if their wallet software shows a payment to a
specific address of a specific amount at some approximate time. Making
exact payment amounts unique - add a few satoshis - is a trivial if
slightly ugly way of making sure payments can be identified uniquely
over the phone. That the procedure at Mt. Gox let front-line customer
service reps manually send funds to customers without a proper
investigation of why the funds didn't arrive was a serious mistake on
their part.

Ultimately this is more of a social engineering attack than a technical
one, and a good example of why well-thought-out payment protocols are
helpful. Though the BIP70 payment protocol doesn't yet handle busines to
individual, or individual to indivudal, payments a future iteration can
and this kind of problem will be less of an issue.

Similarly stealth addresses have an inherent per-tx unique identifier,
the derived pubkey, which a UI might be able to take advantage of.
