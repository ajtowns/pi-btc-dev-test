Anthony,

For the sake of argument:

(1) What would the situation look like if there was no patent?

(2) Would the same essential formulation exist if there had been a
patent on bitcoin mining ASICs in general?

(3) Would an unforeseen future patented mining optimization exhibit
the same characteristics?

(4) Given that patent is a state grant of monopoly privilege, could a
state licensing regime for miners, applied in the same scope as a
patent, but absent any patent, have the same effect?
