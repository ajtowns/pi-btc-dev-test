Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Block size following technological growth
Message-ID: <CAPg+sBj-wA1DMrwkQRWnzQoB5NR-q=2-5=WDAAUYfSpXRZSTqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

here is a proposal for long-term scalability I've been working on:
https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6

Some things are not included yet, such as a testnet whose size runs ahead
of the main chain, and the inclusion of Gavin's more accurate sigop
checking after the hard fork.

Comments?
