No. There is no such thing as "non-standard transactions" really; it is simply 
"transactions outside of the bounds that I as a user/miner will relay/accept". 
It is perfectly legitimate for other users/miners to relay/accept transactions 
more liberally. By penalising for transactions falling outside of your 
*personal policies*, you would end up banning many legitimate nodes.
