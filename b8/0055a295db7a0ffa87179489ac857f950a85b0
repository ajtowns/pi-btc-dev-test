Since you replied to me;

I have to admit I find that a little depressing.
I put forward about 10 reasons in the last 24 hours and all you remember is 
something with fees.  Which, thats the funny part, I never wrote as being a 
problem directly.

I would really like to avoid putting blame. I'd like to avoid the FUD 
accusation and calling people paranoid, even yourself, sounds rather bad 
too...

Personally I think its a bad idea to do write the way you do, which is that 
some people have to prove that bad things will happen if we don't make a 
certain change. It polarizes the discussion and puts people into camps. People 
have to choose sides.

I've been reading the blocksize debate for months now and have been 
wondering 
why people here are either for or against, it makes no sense to me.
Neither camp is right, and everyone knows this!
Everyone knows that bigger blocks doesn't solve the scalability problem. 
Everyone knows that you can't get substantial growth using lightning or higher 
fees in, say, the next 12 months.
