You're completely correct Ryan.

There has been a well functioning fee market since 2011.  Average fees
have never been zero, despite low-fee transactions being mined, and
despite no block size pressure until September 2014.

Another empirical fact also needs explaining.  Why have average fees *as
measured in BTC* risen during the times of highest public interest in
bitcoin?  This happened without block size pressure, and it is not an
exchange rate effect -- these are raw BTC fees:

... more evidence that conclusively refutes the conjecture that a
production quota is necessary for a "functioning fee market."  A
production quota merely pushes up fees.  We have a functioning market,
and so far, it shows that wider bitcoin usage is even more effective
than a quota at pushing up fees.
