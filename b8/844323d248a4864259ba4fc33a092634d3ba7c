Because the bottleneck is hashing the transaction, which costs (in CPU time) 
based on its size. Maybe it would make sense to factor sigops into the limit, 
though?

Make it 100kB and I think we'd be okay. Those have always been policy-
forbidden so there should be no expectation they'd be acceptable in the 
future.

While we're at it, I suggest also specifying a minimum transaction size as 
well. The raw minimum possible is 60 bytes, but any sane output would need at 
least a hash, so I'd say make the minimum be 8 (60 + 160-bit hash) bytes?
