Yes, Satoshi transferred the key to Gavin when he "left". I agree we should
keep it, btw. There have been suggestions before on this list to use the
alert system to ask people to upgrade to recent versions of the client (eg.
the disconnect issue 0.3.20-0.3.23 had). I feel there may come a moment when
we really need to use it for that purpose.
