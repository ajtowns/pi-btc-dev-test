Ignoring the cost of storing these never-spent outputs; there is absolutely no 
reason we need to ensure that coins aren't lost.  Nor worry about those that 
are.

The total bitcoins produced is an entirely arbitrary number -- a function of 
the 210,000 halving rate and the initial block reward.  Satoshi could have 
picked anything for them and bitcoin would work exactly the same.

Lost coins never enter the economy ever again, and so supply is slightly lower 
than it would have been, making all the non-lost coins worth ever so slightly 
more.  Effectively: price adjustments will take care of lost coins.
