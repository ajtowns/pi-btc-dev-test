Users would tolerate depreciation because the intention is to have a cheap
way of transacting using a two-way pegged chain that isn't controlled by
miners.   Who cares about some minor depreciation when the purpose of the
chain is to do cheap secure transactions forever?

Add in UTXO commitments and you've got a system that is cheap and
secure-enough for transfer. storage and accumulation of a ledger... before
moving in to the main chain.

Seems better to me than messing with the main chain's incentive structure
via merged mining.
