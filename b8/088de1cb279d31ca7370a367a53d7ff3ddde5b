For 0.13.0 I had to do

export LANG=en_US.utf8

before running the test suite. I build in clean chroot build environment 
to avoid accidental linking to non-standard libraries, and in that 
environment the LANG is normally set to C as LANG normally doesn't 
matter for compiling software that is expected to run regardless of what 
the LANG is.

That I believe was fixed in 0.13.1.

In 0.13.1 the error is


Running test/bitcoin-util-test.py...

     "bitcoin-util-test.json",buildenv)

0.13.0 test works just fine (once the LANG is set to something utf8)
