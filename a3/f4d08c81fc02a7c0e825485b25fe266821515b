Its mostly a problem for exchanges and miners. Those entities need to
be on the network 100% of the time because they are using the network
100% of the time. A normal wallet user isn't taking payments every few
minutes like the exchanges are. "Getting booted off the network" is
not something to worry about for normal wallet users.

If miners aren't up to date, that is the biggest problem. A sudden
drop in hashpower will effect the network for all users, including
normal wallet users (by them having to wait longer for confirmations).
Miners must not be booted off the network ever. Hashpower voting is
the best way to make sure this never happens.
