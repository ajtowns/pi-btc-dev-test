I've thought about [ab]using Tor as a STUN replacement before, but the
issue is a lot of people don't have computers that are switched on all the
time anymore except for their smartphones, which are too weak to calculate
the UTXO set. The trend has been for a while towards laptops, phones and
tablets, all of which are relatively weak.

I think there might be a market for a one-click "bring up an amazon VPS,
sync a full node and make it accessible only to me" type service though!
