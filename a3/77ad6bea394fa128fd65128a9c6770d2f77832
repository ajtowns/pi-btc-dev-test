Interesting idea, though as Wladimir mentioned, a real-world "key" is much
less secure than a Bitcoin/PGP "key", though in this case, I could see your
physical/visual "key" being any complex, high-contrast image (like a Motion
Tracking Target: https://www.google.com/search?q=tracking+markers&tbm=isch),
if just using edge-detection (a high-contrast image would help make
low-light or out-of-focus shots still able to be detected), though like a
QR-code, it should probably have calibration markers in the corners to
specify orientation (would help decoding a skewed or rotated image) and the
standard should enforce some minimum level of complexity to prevent really
simple and easy-to-reproduce/steal keys .

Though if you're getting to that level of complexity, you might as well
just have a QR code of the private key.
