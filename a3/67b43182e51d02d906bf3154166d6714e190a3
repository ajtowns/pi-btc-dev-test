I agree, s7r, that Bitcoin Core represents the most stable code base.  To create multiple implementations, other groups would fork Bitcoin Core similar to what Bitcoin XT did.  We could have:

- Bitcoin-A (XT)
- Bitcoin-B (Blockstream)
- Bitcoin-C (promoting BIP100)
- Bitcoin-D
- etc.

Innovation from any development group would be freely integrated by any other development group, if desired.  Of course, each group would have a very strong incentive to remain fork-wise compatible with the other implementations.  

In fact, this just gave me a great idea!  Since Wladimir has stated that he will not integrate a forking change into Core without Core Dev consensus, I suggest we work together to never reach consensus with Bitcoin Core.  This will provide impetus for new implementations to fork from Core (like XT did) and implement whatever scaling solution they deem best.  The users will then select the winning solution simply based on the code they choose to run.  The other implementations will then rush to make compatible changes in order to keep their dwindling user bases.  

This is the decentralized spirit of Bitcoin in action.  Creative destruction.  Consensus formed simply by the code that gets run.  

Let's kill Bitcoin Core and allow the green shoots of a garden of new implementations to grow from its fertile ashes.  

Sincerely,
Peter R
