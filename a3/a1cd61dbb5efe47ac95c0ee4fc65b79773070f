Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP149 timeout-- why so far in the future?
Message-ID: <CAAS2fgQNPvEuta0KubeDetgYxGhWvdGK10jig0y4ayv0EvZPLw@mail.gmail.com>

Based on how fast we saw segwit adoption, why is the BIP149 timeout so
far in the future?

It seems to me that it could be six months after release and hit the
kind of density required to make a stable transition.

(If it were a different proposal and not segwit where we already have
seen what network penetration looks like-- that would be another
matter.)
