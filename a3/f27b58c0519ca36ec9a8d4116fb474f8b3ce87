OP_0 gives a zero length byte array because OP_0 == 0x00 which is equivalent to pushdata with zero length.

OP_EQUAL compares byte strings as-is. So it will push "false" because empty string is not the same as a single-byte string with 0x00 byte in it. Value "false" in turn is encoded as empty string, just like result of OP_0.
