Unfortunately, one major attack vector is someone isolating your node,
getting you to sign away your whole wallet to fee, and then selling it
to a mining pool to mine it before you can figure why your transactions
aren't making it to the network.  In such an attack, the relay rules
aren't relevant, and if the attacker can DoS you for 24 hours, it
doesn't take a ton of mining power to make the attack extremely likely
to succeed.
