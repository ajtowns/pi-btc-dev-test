Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Splitting BIPs
Message-ID: <CABr1YTcoWesaBJaT--bbUUN-c2phc-=3ieWT7vVDNPGg0iHH2g@mail.gmail.com>

Seems like a lot of effort and goodwill is being wasted on contention over
things we don't really need to agree upon. In order to help us better
prioritize, I propose adding an extra attribute to BIPs indicating their
"level" which is split into five as follows:

1. Consensus (hard/soft fork)
2. Peer Services
3. RPC
4. Implementations
5. Applications

I posted an example of what such a table might look like here: http://
blockhawk.net/bitcoin-dev/bipwiki.html

If other folks also think this is a good idea I'll start working on a BIP
draft for this.
