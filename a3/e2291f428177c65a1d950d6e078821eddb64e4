I'm not trying to pick nits about all the options,  I just found it
surprising that you were saying that data published in a super public
manner is no different than something used between nodes.

Communication is a two way street, Adam and I (and others) are
earnestly trying? that we're not following your arguments may be a
suggestion that they need to be communicated somewhat differently.

I'm still failing to see the usefulness of having any prefix filtering
for DH-private outputs. It really complicates the security story? in
particular you don't know _now_ what activities will turn your prior
information leaks into compromising ones retrospectivelly, and doesn't
seem at very necessary for scanning performance.
