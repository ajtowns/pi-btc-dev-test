Subject: [Bitcoin-development] libzerocoin released,
 what about a zerocoin-only alt-coin with either-or mining
Message-ID: <20130705140140.GA23949@netbook.cypherspace.org>

Hi

I presume everyone saw the announce from Matthew Green & Ian Miers at JHU on
the release of libzerocoin: https://github.com/Zerocoin/libzerocoin

So now that raises the question of how can people experiment with real money
with zerocoin.  I think its fair to summarize there is resistance to merging
into bitcoin as it slows validation, bloats the blockchain, and also a
policy aspect it also imports cryptographic privacy into bitcoin.

On the forum thread on zerocoin math etc I suggested maybe people interested
to explore bitcoin could create an all-zerocoin alt-coin that is either-or
mined and p2p exchangeable for bitcoin.

Do people think that should work?  It seems to me it should with minimal,
bitcoin changes.  I think the rule for either-or mining should be as simple
as skipping the value / double-spend validation of the blocks that are
zerocoin mining blocks.  Obviously zerocoin blocks can themselves end up on
forks, that get resolved, but that fork resolution can perhaps be shared? 
(Because the fork resolution is simply to accept the longest fork).
