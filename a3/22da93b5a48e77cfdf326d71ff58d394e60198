Not strictly speaking a wallet but we (BlockCypher) will also go down the
segwit path as soon as the BIP and branch are mature enough.  All
transactions built from our APIs should eventually be segwitted (just made
up a verb).

Thanks,
Matthieu
*CTO and Founder, Blockcypher*
I have been informed that Breadwallet has also committed to supporting
segwit.

The list now includes Blocktrail, Breadwallet, GreenAddress, GreenBits,
mSIGNA, and NBitcoin.
