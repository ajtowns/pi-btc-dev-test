Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Roadmap for autotools / Qt gui merge
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=S0_K7kftB-+driDFiXBQ6LDhSPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I think my Qt GUI is pretty much ready for merging. I've been using it for a
while and all functionality works.

What is the current roadmap for including the autotools build system, so
that it will be possible to support multiple GUIs? 0.4.0?
