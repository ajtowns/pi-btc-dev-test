Introspection/command discovery is nice, but I would prefer it to be immediately done in the first version exchange so no assumptions as to how a network is operating need to be made.

I like the idea of a flat list of commands. It might make sense to have "meta"-commands that alias to groups of commands. i.e "original" for the current core subset up to (and including) "pong". The aliases could exist in a text definition file which is held on github or bitcoin.org/

Outside of major features advertised network-wide in nService bits,
P2P protocol lacks a good method of enumerating minor features or
extensions.? The version number increment is coarse-grained, and is
not self-documenting.? A simple extension which lists supported
commands is added, as demonstrated in this pull request:

? ? https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1471

Another option is for verack to return this information at login,
eliminating the need for a separate command/response.
