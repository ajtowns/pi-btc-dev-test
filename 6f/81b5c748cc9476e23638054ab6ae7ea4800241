Hi ????????,

I won't comment on the usability of/need for this system, but I have a few
random comments and questions:

Why demand exactly one input? This will probably cause problems for wallets
with many small value UTXOs and no big.

Why demand exactly type p2wpkh on input? Why limit at all?

32-byte-nym_public_key is actually 33 bytes, no? Compressed pubkeys are 33
bytes.

Why verify "SIZE 32 EQUALVERIFY" on output 2? It puts a ceiling on the
entropy, but no floor, so it seems useless.

Why require segwit version 0 change output? This seems like an unnecessary
limitation.

It's not clear to me what's IsStandard rules and what's nym protocol rules
in the specification section. I interpret the specification to specify
IsStandard rules, but the section also mentions stuff not relevant to that,
for example how the nym signature is constructed and what the opreturn data
consists of. You should make the distinction more clear.

I couldn't find info on what 1-byte-nym_version and 1-byte-nym_use are and
how they are used. But it might not belong in the BIP if it only should
describe IsStandard policies?

Regards,
Kalle
