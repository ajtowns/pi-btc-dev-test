Levin,

The hope is that eventually the network will be sufficiently resilient and robust to be able to handle anything that?s thrown at it. But it?s still a baby?and this is a serious problem indeed, because on the one hand we don?t want any central authority but on the other it still needs some guardians?and we don?t have anything resembling the kind of institution that could possibly be entrusted to nurture and care for this baby until it is ready to go out on its own.

Imagine, when the US Constitution was being written, if suddenly everyone started to just propose their own different version of it and insisting (under threat of fork) on their own versions before any sort of government could be created. Yes, I know the US federal government is not exactly the paragon of decentralization?but regardless of your views on the US government, it?s still a somewhat analogous situation. Until the system was in place, some people (who at the time were unelected) had to bootstrap the process.

For better or worse, Satoshi has left the picture?and no clear succession model was put in place. The Bitcoin Foundation, which for a time attempted to be a guardian institution, ended up self-destructing. It was an utter failure.

We don?t have any sort of institution like this?and we don?t really want one. But the system is still not fully in place. Importantly, we lack any mechanisms to be able to make potentially controversial changes without serious risks.

It would be amazing if despite this trial-by-fire we still survived and managed to pull through. And if we do we?ll be stronger for it. But quite sincerely, I would have wanted the system to be a little more mature before putting it through this trial. At least I would have liked to have gone through a test hard-fork using a far less politically divisive issue.

Anyhow, completely separate from my views on governance, etc?my main point is that we?re ALL trying to do what?s best given our understanding and resources?and we?ve all poured our hearts and souls into this. We might disagree on certain things, but let?s stop this negativity and misrepresentation and try to figure out a way forward that is less likely to lead to a war.

For better or worse, it is *very hard* to change the rules?and this is exactly what imbues Bitcoin with one of its most powerful attributes: very well-defined settlement guarantees that cannot be suddenly altered nor reversed by anyone.

And even then, we?ve encountered a number of problems with these deployments that have at times required goodwill cooperation between developers and mining pool operators to fix.

If even fairly uncontroversial soft forks have caused problems, can you imagine the kinds of potential problems that a hard fork over some highly polarizing issue might raise? Do you really think people are going to want to cooperate?!?
> 
> I can understand that some people would like bigger blocks. Other people might want feature X, others feature Y?and we can argue the merits of this or that to death?but the fact remains that we have NEVER attempted any hard forking change?not even with a simple, totally uncontroversial no-brainer improvement that would not risk any sort of ill-will that could hamper remedies were it not to go as smoothly as we like. *THIS* is the fundamental problem - the whole bigger block thing is a minor issue by comparison?it could be any controversial change, really.
> 
> Would you want to send your test pilots on their first flight?the first time an aircraft is ever flown?directly into combat without having tested the plane? This is what attempting a hard fork mechanism that?s NEVER been done before in such a politically divisive environment basically amounts to?but it?s even worse. We?re basically risking the entire air force (not just one plane) over an argument regarding how many seats a plane should have that we?ve never flown before.
> 
> We?re talking billlions of dollars? worth of other people?s money that is on the line here. Don?t we owe it to them to at least test out the system on a far less controversial, far less divisive change first to make sure we can even deploy it without things breaking? I don?t even care about the merits regarding bigger blocks vs. smaller blocks at this point, to be quite honest - that?s such a petty thing compared to what I?m talking about here. If we attempt a novel hard-forking mechanism that?s NEVER been attempted before (and which as many have pointed out is potentially fraught with serious problems) on such a politically divisive, polarizing issue, the result is each side will refuse to cooperate with the other out of spite?and can easily lead to a war, tanking the value of everyone?s assets on both chains. All so we can process 8 times the number of transactions we currently do? Even if it were 100 times, we wouldn?t even come close to touching big payment processors like Visa. It?s hard to imagine a protocol improvement that?s worth the risk.
> 
> I urge you to at least try to see the bigger picture here?and to understand that nobody is trying to stop anyone from doing anything out of some desire for maintaining control - NONE of us are able to deploy hard forks right now without facing these problems. And different people obviously have different priorities and preferences as to which of these changes would be best to do first. This whole XT thing is essentially giving *one* proposal special treatment above those that others have proposed. Many of us have only held back from doing this out of our belief that goodwill amongst network participants is more important than trying to push some pet feature some of us want.
