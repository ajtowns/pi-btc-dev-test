Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Freimarkets: a proposal for user assets,
 distributed exchange, and off-chain txns
Message-ID: <5217FACA.2000102@monetize.io>

Hash: SHA1

Off-and-on for the past couple years, Jorge Tim?n and I have been
developing an extension of the Bitcoin and (pre-OpenCoin) Ripple
distributed protocols which enable user-specified bearer instruments,
distributed peer-to-peer exchange, off-chain accounting, auctions,
derivatives and transitive transactions, and the multitude of financial
contracts having such primitives would make possible. The specification
is now reasonably complete enough that we would like to receive input
from the community. The PDF is available for viewing here:

http://freico.in/docs/freimarkets-v0.0.1.pdf

We're looking for public comments about this or related approaches. In
particular we've spent a fair chunk of time working out how to handle
coordination of private accounting servers with the public chain and
derivatives contracts, both of which are basically cryptographic
protocols expressed as bitcoin scripts. Input from any of the resident
cryptographers would be very appreciated.

Happy hacking,
Mark Friedenbach
