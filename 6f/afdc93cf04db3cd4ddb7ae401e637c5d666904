After reading all 99 messages in this thread, I think allowfee is just 
about perfect.

It effectively lets merchants to give an allowance against the purchase 
price for network fees, if they choose.  It is still up to the sender 
(and/or the sender's software) to get the fees right.  Sometimes the 
sender will need to pay more fees than allowed, and sometimes the sender 
will need to pay less.

We can't solve the fee problem, in general.  I'm not sure that we can 
even define it properly.  But this is something that we can do, that 
will be useful at least occasionally, and that will cause no harm the 
rest of the time.

P.S.  Clever senders can use this to defrag their wallets.  Who wants to 
write the patch for that?
