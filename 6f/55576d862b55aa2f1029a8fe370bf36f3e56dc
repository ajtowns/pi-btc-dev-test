I'm generally opposed to doing "too much" at once in this kind of change.

Some changes, like this one, are completely uncontroversial (except
some argument about having fork causing change at all) where some have
more complicated social/economic impacts (the block size being among
them, though probably not the worst).

Moreover, the longer we go between such changes the more the cost is
perceived to be infinite. Better to take one per year, with six months
of gap between implementation, and give everyone the right
expectations than to have prolonged arguments due to our inexperience
that only get trumped by emergency changes.

General network health and user security _requires_ periodic upgrades
in any case, and will for the foreseeable future. The whole notion
that old versions will _stop working_ would be a pretty good thing at
this point in bitcoin's existence, judging by the high number of
pre-.24 listeners still reported.
