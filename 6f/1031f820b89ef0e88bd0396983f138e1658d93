Dear Jim,

Thank you for sharing your view w.r.t. the so called 'Chinese Miners'.

Diversity of opinion, and mining, are IMHO both good and it's indeed a
free world.... so others who wish to mine bitcoin should be encouraged  to
make the capital and technical investments to do so.

May I ask what is your technical suggestion to move this discussion forward
beyond your anti-Chinese/anti-China rhetoric?   e.g. I would be
particularly grateful if you could share your  views w.r.t. colluding miner
attacks in draft 0.5.9. of Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja's 'Lightning
network' paper, found here:-

Respectfully,

p.
