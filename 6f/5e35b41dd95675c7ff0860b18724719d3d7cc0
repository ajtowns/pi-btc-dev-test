I see a number of people claiming they know what should be posted to 
this list but those claims appear to be without merit.

The list states the subject is "Development discussion list for Bitcoin 
protocol and its implementation."  That is a pretty broad description 
that appears to encompass a number of topics that are claimed to be 
"off-topic" by people who seem to be making up their own rules.  One guy 
even contacts people and threatens to have the list moderated if you 
don't follow his rules even though it appears he has no such authority 
and there are no official rules he can reference.

Maybe there should be a more precise description if the discussion is to 
be limited in some way beyond the "official" description.
