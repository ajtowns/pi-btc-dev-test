Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Considering starting a toy full-node implementation.
	Any advice?
Message-ID: <1D59197E-93ED-42CE-9DB1-EC3219540C02@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm considering to start developing a toy full validating node implementation (no wallet, no mining) for educational purposes.

Some questions:

1) which resource do you suggest for as a reference for the protocol?
2) which part do you suggest to start with?
3) I was thinking to use btcd as a reference since I'm not familiar with C++ (bitcoind)
4) are there any other general advice or tips for such endeavours?

Thanks in advance.
