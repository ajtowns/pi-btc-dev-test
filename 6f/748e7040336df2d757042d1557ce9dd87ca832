We do automatic refunds. When bitcoins arrive after an offer has expired
(which happens quite often with webwallets that don't broadcast
transactions immediately), we return all the bitcoins to a specified
bitcoin-address. This happens a couple of times per day and can amount
to a couple of hundred bitcoins per offer.
