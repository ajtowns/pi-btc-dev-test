Your proposal fails here:
"If the block defined in the Guarantee Message has not been shown"

What is blockchain? You can see blockchain as a mechanism to prove 
something has been shown by certain order. Therefore, it is not possible 
to prove something has not been shown with blockchain.

Your proposal works only with a centralized trusted party.
