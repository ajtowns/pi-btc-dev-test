Because there was a discussion on reddit about this topic, I want to
clarify that Johnson Lau explained how a check in the code prevents this
attack.
So there is no real attack.

Also note that the subject of this thread has a question mark, which means
that I'm asking the community for clarification, not asserting the
existence of a vulnerability.

The segwit code is complex, and some key parts of the consensus code are
spread over the source files (such as state.CorruptionPossible() relation
to DoS banning, IsNull() check in witness program serialization, etc.).

Thanks again Johnson for your clarifications.
