Subject: [Bitcoin-development] [PULL] Add scriptPubKey enforced sendescrow
 and redeemescrow API calls
Message-ID: <18440.87.106.138.84.1308200020.squirrel@lavabit.com>

I have a pull request here:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/319

>From the README:

  Bitcoin "escrow" are coins that are under the control of multiple
  parties.  The initial implementation allows n parties to vote, with
  k good signatures needed (k <= n).

  This eliminates single points of failure and reduces the trust required
  in many transaction use cases.

Use cases include Escrow (without trusting the escrow agent with the
coins), immediate payment and funds locked with multi-party signatures.

This was inspired by https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=8821.0 and
https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=4723.msg68804 .

Feedback on the pull is very much appreciated.
