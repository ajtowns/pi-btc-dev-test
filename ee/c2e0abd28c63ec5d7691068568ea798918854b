Satoshi,

As much as I want to believe this is you it's very difficult to ignore the
fact that Vistomail could have been hacked and I'm currently speaking to a

Can you copy and paste what you wrote above, to
http://p2pfoundation.ning.com as well, like how you did during the Dorian

Much appreciated.
