I'm not sure splitting the patch this way makes a big difference.  The
IsStandard part depends on the construction of the multisign script, which
is what most of the patch does anyway.  In other words, if upon further
review the script construction needs to change, IsStandard will change. 
So a full review would be better.

Also, with unit test coverage for both this feature and existing
script.cpp code, I'm hoping that this patch is relatively low risk and
actually pays down some existing test debt.
