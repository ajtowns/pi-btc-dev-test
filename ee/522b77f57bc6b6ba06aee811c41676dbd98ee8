Think your example is not quite valid ...

People say or write $88M or $45k I.e. use SI prefix as a suffix, else it would be more, not less, clear on what amount is being referred to.

For me, "bits" are easy to say and one million as a factor is simple to understand.

M-bits, kilobits, millibits, etc are never going to be used by folk in everyday transactions, IMHO
