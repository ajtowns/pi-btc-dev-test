Looking at this graph and in retrospective, we shouldn't have removed
the standard policy limit without observing the supposedly disastrous
effects of hitting the limit first.
Removing the standard limit would have been trivial (bdb issues aside)
at any point after seeing the effects.

Well, this is only for first confirmations of free transaction.
A higher fee should increase your probabilities, but if you're sending
free transactions you may not care about them taking longer to be
included.

Well, maybe "instant and free" it's not a honest form of bitcoin
marketing and it just has to disappear.
Maybe we just need to start being more honest about pow being good for
processing micro-transactions: it is not.
Hopefully lightning will be good for that.
Free and fast in-chain transactions is something temporary that we
know will eventually disappear.
If people think it would be a adoption disaster that it happens soon,
then they could also detail an alternative plan to roll that out
instead of letting it happen.
But if the plan is to delay it forever...then I'm absolutely against.

I take this as an argument for increasing fee competition and thus,
against increasing the block size.

No blacklisting, please, that's centralized.
In any case, a related known: bigger blocks give competitive advantage
to bigger miners.
