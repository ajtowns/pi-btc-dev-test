It's not public.  When I say "please pay me" I also say "use this
multiplier".  The multiplier isn't published, and it's not publicly
discoverable without my wallet (or access to my email).  The address
remains private between you and me.  As you said, it could be
discoverable if the email is discoverable, but I'm not seeing how how
critical that really is.

There's a lot of complexity around this constraint (possibly involving
new/secondary private keys, extra outputs, relying on change outputs,
and/or using 3rd parties to help look for transactions).  I'm not
convinced that what is being gained is really worth that extra complexity.

By contrast, what I proposed, that does require sending sending the
payer a multiplier once, is easy to implement in any BIP 32 wallet,
doesn't require any special address formats, and achieves 98% of the
same benefits without any special computation.   I guess I'm just not
convinced that it's really necessary for people to be able to send
others payments without contacting them (and/or hiding the evidence a
payment was made even if they communications were discovered).
