Assuming the sender is not an uncooperative idiot, you can simply
include expiration information and the sender can refuse to send after
that time.

If the sender is an uncooperative idiot, they can always change your
target and send anyways.

This would seem to work nearly as well as the non-reorg safe network
impacting version, and yet has no cost beyond the extra size is
communicating the limit.
