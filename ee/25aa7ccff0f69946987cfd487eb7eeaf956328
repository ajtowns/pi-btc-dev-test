I'd be very cautious of security implications of embedding files into
the payment request. Even file formats one would presume safe, such as
images, have had security issues (i.e.
https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms11-006 )

Longer term I was wondering about embedding the PaymentRequest into web
pages directly via the <object> tag, which could eliminate need for
BIP0072 and potentially improve user interface integration that way.
Obviously this would require browser plugins, however.
