Yes.

1. SegWit transactions spend less "weight", which is limited for every
block. Base transaction data weights as much as 4x the witness data.

2. SegWit signatures can be cheaper to verify (linear instead of
quadratic). Prior to this, DoS attacks were possible by using forged
transactions including signatures which could take several minutes to
verify.

The immediate result of this is that miners can fit more transactions
into a block and at the same time spend less power building the blocks.
