It is important ro note that even if lightning was never developed, the
block size remains at 1 MB forever and fees rise to 10 usd per transaction,
such "high fees" are still extremely competitive with non-decentralized
payment systems that have proportional fees. For example, 10 usd is still
lower than 1% when you are moving more than 1000 usd. I know, this doesn't
work for micro-transactions, but I don't think Bitcoin can be useful for
micro-transactions in the long term unless something like lightning payment
channels is deployed. Until we accept the second fact, it will be very hard
to discuss any projection of future usage. I think that believing that all
the transactions of the entire world population can be made in-chain while
keeping bitcoin decentralized is incredibly naive. Not even nasdaq has that
capacity (and if full node's require nasdaq's capacity, I don't think we
can talk about a decentralized system anymore).
