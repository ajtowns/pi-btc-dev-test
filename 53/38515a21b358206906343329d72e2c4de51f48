Pieter's performance numbers are a bit conservative if anything?
profiles on ultraprune[1] show that the reference client's wasting of
a lot of time in redundant serialization and hashing operations is
the major time sink. Once thats cleared up it should be quite a
bit faster

In particular,  if the BDB indexing in ultraprune is replaced with
a hash committed tree structure who's root is committed in the
blockchain you then have a txout commitment scheme.
Ultraprune is most of the messy structural work for that. The
rest is mostly storage differences.
