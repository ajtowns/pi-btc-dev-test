FWIW, BIP44 also doesn't encode a seed birthday. This needed so that SPV
wallets do not need to scan from the beginning of the blockchain.

That doesn't mean BIP44 could not be final. There are some wallets that
interoperate on that standard and that's fine. The whole reason I
insisted on separating BIP43 from BIP44 is that someone else can come up
with a better "BIP44+" standard and not get into the way of existing
standards. I think BIP43 should be made final as well, if it isn't already.
