It doesn't appear to me that reoccurring payments, receive accounts,
multisig addresses, etc can be used with this proposal, but instead
you must use a different purpose code and another BIP and are not
compatible with the draft here.

Am I misunderstanding it?   Will Electrum be limiting itself in this
way?  I'd consider it a unfortunate loss of functionality if wallets
couldn't implement reoccurring payment chains without making users
generate entirely different wallets (which they couldn't share funds
across) since addresses for recurring payments was one of the main
motivations in BIP32.
