No, segregated witness
https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases-faq is a
soft-fork maybe loosely similar to P2SH - particularly it is backwards
and forwards compatible by design.

These firm forks have the advantage over hard forks that there is no
left-over weak chain that is at risk of losing money (because it
becomes a consensus rule that old transactions are blocked).

There is also another type of fork a firm hard fork that can do the
same but for format changes that are not possible with a soft-fork.

Extension blocks show a more general backwards and forwards compatible
soft-fork is also possible.
Segregated witness is simpler.
