The soft-limit is there miners themselves produce smaller blocks; the
soft-limit does not prevent other miners from producing larger blocks.

As we're talking about ways that other miners can use 20MB blocks to
harm the competition, talking about the soft-limit is irrelevant.
Similarly, as security engineers we must plan for the worst case; as
we've seen before by your campaigns to raise the soft-limit(1) even at a
time when the vast majority of transaction volume was from one user
(SatoshiDice) soft-limits are an extremely weak form of control.

For the proposes of discussing blocksize increase requirements we can
stop talking about the soft-limit.
