Yes, my next step is prototyping.

Note that this is not a BIP yet:  I want to have a working implementation
before making this an Official BIP.

yeah... I had similar thoughts on what to do if some Outputs specify an
amount and others don't. I'm still waffling on whether or not I like
allowing repeated Outputs; a single Output would make the spec a fair bit
simpler, and if a merchant wants to split up a payment for some reason they
could just generate another transaction.

I want to move on to actually implementing this before creating complicated
rules. Maybe the best way to tip a waitress is to get two separate
PaymentRequests, one for the restaurant and one that goes directly to the
waitress (depends on whether or not the restaurant needs or wants to know
how much their employees are getting tipped, I suppose).  Maybe it would be
best to have a separate "gratuity" Output in the PaymentRequest. That's the
kind of detail I think doesn't need to be worked out right now, I'd rather
restaurants tell us what they need/want.

This is the case of getting an UNSIGNED payment request; I've changed the
wording a little to make that more clear.

If a bitcoin client accepts unsigned payment requests (a couple of people
have asked if that would be possible so I think that is desired), then it
doesn't have the payer's identity-- all it has is the Outputs that will be
paid.

Not a BIP yet....

serialized_paymentrequest -> serialized_payment_request?


Done.

I still like the idea of only including the root CAs who have jumped
through the hoops needed to get the "allowed to issue EV certs" blessing.
 I'm not suggesting that all bitcoin merchants must get EV certs, but I am
suggesting that they must get a certificate from one of the most reputable
certificate authorities, and the ability to issue EV certificates is, I
think, a good proxy for that.

But, again:  Not a BIP yet.  Lets get something implemented and then hammer
out details (implementing always turns up edge cases you forgot when
spec'ing).
