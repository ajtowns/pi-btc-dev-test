Subject: [Bitcoin-development] IPv6 bitcoin support now live
Message-ID: <CA+8xBpfdN4QNwvkeU3z+oFybf9Z0DyHnVLF=AVA2gyfh65Gqeg@mail.gmail.com>

sipa just pushed out IPv6 support to bitcoin/bitcoin.git, and we have
a few IPv6 nodes live on the network already.

If you have IPv6, please pull the latest bitcoin and test!

(and if you do not yet have IPv6, visit https://www.sixxs.net/ and get some)
