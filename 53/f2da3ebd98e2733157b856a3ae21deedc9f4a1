Subject: [bitcoin-dev] AT&T has effectively banned Bitcoin nodes by
	closing port 8333 via a hidden firewall in the cable box

I have been struggling to get port 8333 open all year, I gave up and was
using blockchain for months despite a strong desire to stay on Bitcoin Core,
but now the issue has reached critical mass since I'm using the python
Bitcoin server module. I have literally spent my entire day trying to open
8333, I thoroughly made sure it was open on the router and computer and it's
still closed. Strangely enough I got it open for 30 seconds once today but
something closed it immediately.

After hours of phone calls and messaging AT&T finally told me the truth of
what was going on, and only because I noticed it myself and demanded an
answer. The internet is being routed through a DVR/cable box, and they
confirmed the DVR also has a firewall. To make this even more absurd they
refused to turn the firewall off because it is their equipment. So
effectively they can firewall any port they want even if the customer asks
them not to, in the unlikely event the customer figures it out.

Perhaps this is the driving force behind the inexplicable and massive
decline in Bitcoin nodes. Bitcoin is being censored by the ISPs themselves,
and they won't even tell you that. I had to get in touch with headquarters
and threaten to rip it out of the wall to get a proper answer.


I am grateful that, as of this current moment, Time Warner doesn't seem to
mind. I am aware of what you're saying, because a friend had me look at
their AT&T system one day, and I discovered all their equipment is now
running over IP. I was not aware, however, that they wouldn't unblock a
port.

I run a bitcoin node, miners ,all sort of other stuff (like Video, etc.) and
it runs pretty good, even with me myself having everything 'double
firewalled'. Time Warner seems the way to go!
