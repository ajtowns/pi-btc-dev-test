I took a brief look at the code - it's looking very reasonable. You can
replace any construct like

try {
  Thread.sleep(1000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
  throw new RuntimeException(e);
}

which is quite verbose, just with
Uninterruptibles.sleepUninterruptably(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); (and of
course static imports help too)

I think for this concept to take off, you'd need a website and to recruit
someone to help you market it. Pool operators won't reach out to you.

I still find it perhaps more elegant to just boost the connectivity of the
existing network with bitcoind changes, but this can help for now.
