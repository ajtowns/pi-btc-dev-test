I have some more questions.

1) Should the protocol specification page also be codified into BIP(s)?

2) Should the current wiki pages be taken down / forwarded to the git repo or be auto updated from the git repo?

3) Even though the information in BIP 50 is valuable, should it really be considered a BIP?
