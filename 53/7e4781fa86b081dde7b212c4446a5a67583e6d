Maybe there's some hole in Jorge's logic and scrapping blockmaxsize has
quadratic hashing risks, and maybe James' 10KB is too ambitious; but even
if so, a simple 1MB tx size limit would clearly do the trick.  The broader
point is that quadratic hashing is not a compelling reason to keep
blockmaxsize post-HF: does someone have a better one?
