In general? What constitutes a rule change?

For example, if I understand correctly (from what Gavin said at
Bitcoin 2013), there is a move afoot to lift the block size limit.
Although, when I went to confirm my understanding by reading the
bitcoin-development list archives, I don't see mention of this. Is
there another forum I should be reading if I want to follow Bitcoin
development?

Anyway, I hope that there are some rule changes that you would
consider for Bitcoin, although I recognize there are vast classes of
such changes that you wouldn't.

I'm trying to figure out what's the most productive way to show you,
and everyone, candidates for such changes. Things that are definitely
not suitable for merging to trunk tomorrow, but might be suitable in a
year or two, or "Next Time We Have A Hardfork".

I don't think alternative bitcoin-clones are the best venue for those.
Although they are certainly good venues for changes which can never
make it into Bitcoin.

Perhaps the best venue for such a thing is just to fork bitcoin.git on github.
