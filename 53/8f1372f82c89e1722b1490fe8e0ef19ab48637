Not in the context of economic majority deciding hardforks. After all, the 
outcome of the hardfork *determines* the money supply. So the former money 
supply not supporting the change would just mean they cease to be involved in 
that capacity. But even aside from that, the more relevant factor in terms of 
economic involvement is /acceptance/ of bitcoins as payment for real goods.
