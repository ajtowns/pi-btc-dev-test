The beauty of math is that everyone on the planet agrees how it works.
Everything in Bitcoin is math, with the exception of the blocksize limit
(1MB) which was a stop-gap solution at the time.

No. That would be an epic disaster. There's no such thing as a "simple
policy" when humans are involved. Obviously no one would agree on what X
bytes would be and you'd have some nodes rejecting blocks that others
already accepted.
