Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 113: Median time-past is a HARDfork,
 not a softfork!

Currently, a tx maybe included in a block only if its locktime (x) is 
smaller than the timestamp of a block (y)

BIP113 says that a tx maybe included in a block only if x is smaller 
than the median-time-past (z)

It is already a consensus rule that y > z. Therefore, if x < z, x < y

The new rule is absolutely stricter than the old rule, so it is a 
softfork. Anything wrong with my interpretation?
