While I do think that anonymity (or pseudonymity) is a nice feature, I don't
think it deserves the full focus of the developers. The core of the protocol
is about making transactions in a secure and fast way, not allowing
everybody to be anonymous, whether they want to or not. TOR already is a
good options for those that want to stay anonymous, and there is no need to
pull support into the main client, if only a few will use it. I think very
few of the developers actually claimed that Bitcoin is anonymous, and has
never been a big advertising point from the "official" side of Bitcoin,
network analysis has been always known to break anonymity.

I see no need for action from the developer side.
