YES

Such a bitcoind is what I called border router in a previous mail. 

Yes, SPV wallets are getting ahead of features, so people will use them also because on size just does not fit all, but all want to ensure being on the same trunk of the chain.
Therefore serious user of Bitcoin run a bitcoind as a border router and connect SPV wallets with higher functionality to that trusted node(s).

This is what I think the core should focus on: Being a lightweight superfast consensus building border router and nothing more. No wallet, no GUI, no RPC calls,
no Payment protocol and the rest.
