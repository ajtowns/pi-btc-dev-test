Assuming some form of BIP 100 is a path which people may want to take,
how and at what point do miners vote on this?
Note:
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/37943/bip-100-what-votes-are
- -possible
describes this somewhat, but is unclear as to timeline of when miners
would do the things described.

Followup question thrown in for good measure:
When is BIP 100 anticipated to be published (moved to 'accepted' and
published) at
https://github.com/bitcoin/BIPS ?
