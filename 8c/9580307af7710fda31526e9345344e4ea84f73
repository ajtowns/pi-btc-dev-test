This topic is straying from Bitcoin development into general Bitcoin
governance, policy, or other meta-issues.

We have now the new bitcoin-discuss mailing list now, specifically for
these more free-flowing topics:

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-discuss

Please take further discussion of this thread to that forum.

Thank you,

The bitcoin-dev moderation team
