Hi!

 When my network goes down and I close the Bitcoin, I see the following
message:

---
martinx at floyd:~$ ./bitcoin-0.4.0rc2/bin/32/bitcoin
connect: Network is unreachable


************************
UNKNOWN EXCEPTION
bitcoin in CMyApp::OnUnhandledException()

Segmentation fault
martinx at floyd:~$

Thanks,
Thiago
