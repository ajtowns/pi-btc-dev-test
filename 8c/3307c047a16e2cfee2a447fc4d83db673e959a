Adding/subtracting a randomized offset amount is one way, but there
have also been more sophisticated ideas to obfuscate the amount, e.g.
by adding multiple change outputs or even distributing over multiple
transactions (potentially coinjoined for further privacy).

Mike Hearn had some ideas regarding obfuscation of payment amounts,
which still make sense, and he wrote about them here:
