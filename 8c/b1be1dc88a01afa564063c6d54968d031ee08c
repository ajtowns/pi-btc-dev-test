Yeah, my node has always relayed these transactions. The limit seems
pointless to me, especially when it's per kB: people will just add
more data.

The coinbase maturity DoS limit should not have a chance of immediately
kicking the node, as I believe this could happen normally in rare cases.
Rejecting these transactions is also pretty cheap, AFAIK. A small DoS
score seems reasonable, though.
