I was mansplaining weak blocks to my wife. She asked a simple question:

Why would I, as a miner, publish a weak block if I find one?

I don't know.

Sure, I will get faster propagation for my solved block, should I find one.
On the other hand everybody else mining a similar block will enjoy the same
benefit. Assuming that I'm not a huge miner, it's unlikely that I will
actually solve the block, so I'm probably just giving away fast propagation
times to someone else.

So how does publishing a weak block benefit the producer of it more than
the other miners? Please help me understand this.
