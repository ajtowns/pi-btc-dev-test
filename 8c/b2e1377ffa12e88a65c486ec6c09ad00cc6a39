Subject: [Bitcoin-development] What is the danger if bitcoind startted with
	-flushwallet=false ?
Message-ID: <CAPGavA_OmV5N-4fc3EbjoU+UqFSWUY1bfePHtzAvbo9oYu+ghA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

    I tried to reduce the IO of bitcoind, and I found '-flushwallet=false'.
After trying it, my IO reduced greatly.
    But why 'flushwallet' is true by default? Is there any danger if
closing the flush wallet thread?
    I lost all my coins in testnet after one crash with
'-flushwallet=false', was this because of no flush wallet thread?
