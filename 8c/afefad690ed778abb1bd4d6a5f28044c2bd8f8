I disagree with the importance of this concern and old soft/hardforks will
replace this activation mechanism with height, so that's an argument in
favor of using the height from the start. This is "being discussed" in a
thread branched from bip99's discussion.
Anyway, is this proposing to use the block time or the median block time?
For some hardforks/softforks the block time complicates the implementation
(ie in acceptToMemoryPool) as discussed in the mentioned thread.
