For example, you are paying for concert tickets.  The deal is concert 
tickets for bitcoin.  Or you're buying a company with 3 other investors.

Miners can't update the signature on input #0 after removing input #1.

Replacement is about how difficult it is to change the tx after it is 
broadcast and seen by observers.

Pick any one "maybe".  They're only maybes because it's not realistic 
for them all to happen at once.

Not without replacement, after broadcast, unless they successfully pay 
twice.

In the multisig input case, each signer already accepted the possibility 
of being written out.  Peter Todd's proposal is in the spirit of not 
willfully making unconfirmed txes less reliable.  I'm suggesting that 
multi-input signers should be included in the set of people for whom 
they don't get less reliable.

We'd have to warn signers to multi-input txes instead of just warning 
receivers.
