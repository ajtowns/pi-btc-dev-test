Could this modularization effort lead to a special compiled bitcoind 
simulator that runs many virtual instances of a node on the same system 
(possibly same process)? The simulator would cache crypto computation 
results (ECDSA, SSH-256) to significantly speed up processing 
transactions and blocks between the virtual nodes.  The virtual nodes 
would also need to share the same block data in memory when possible.  
This would also require significant additional work to simulate the 
network and possibly computational limits.

The transactions on the existing block chain could be replayed into 
randomly chosen virtual nodes to help ensure any code changes would not 
have caused problems with historic transactions.  You could even record 
all the messages for some time on many real nodes and use that as test 
data for the simulator.  Many other test programs could be devised to 
quickly simulate other network activity.

This wouldn't completely replace the test network but could provide 
greater and quicker confidence that code changes are safe.
