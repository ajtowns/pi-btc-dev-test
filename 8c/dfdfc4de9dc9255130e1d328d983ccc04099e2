IMO, bitcoin.org is more community-focussed anyway.
How often do devs use the site, compared to GitHub etc?

Someone else made a pullreq for Bitcoin Magazine; I suggest(ed) that
for-profit organizations should be asked to pitch in some way or another.
Who should organize that, I don't know. If Bitcoin Consultancy/Amir is behind 
the conference, I suggest their/his development contributions should be 
sufficient in that respect.

I concur, this should be discussed in a pullreq.
