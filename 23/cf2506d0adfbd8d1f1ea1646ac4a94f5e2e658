I already tried the bounties route- made a forum thread offering $4000 worth of bounties and it got very few? responses before dropping off the page.


Also, http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=4761.0 and http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=4543.0

In the end I came to the conclusion that the only was is to bring in projects and pay people to work fulltime on Bitcoin under an organisation.

Good idea. I'm not sure if the github bug tracker supports extension attributes, but it'd be a great place to add it. Also, people can let know that they're already working on a feature using a comment, to prevent double work.

The biggest problem will be organizational, in getting the BTC together for bounties; only a high profile member such as Gavin will have enough trust to ask for support. Or maybe there's something left in the faucet? :-)

Unrelated: what also might help is publishing a roadmap. Plan a few "bug fix only" releases before scheduling addition of new features. It's also helpful for people that wonder that direction the project is going in...
