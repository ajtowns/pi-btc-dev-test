This may be a semantic issue. I meant that it's not a hard-fork of the
bitcoin protocol, which I'm taking to mean the way in which we all
*expected* every version of the Satoshi client to behave: the rules which
we have documented informally on the wiki, this mailing list, and in code
comments, etc. I'm just trying to prevent protocol-creep.

Luke-Jr is suggesting that we add-to/modify the bitcoin protocol rules
which all verifying implementations must adhere to. I'm suggesting that we
instead change the old codebase to do what we expected it to do all along
(what 0.8 does and what every other verifying implementation does), and
through miner collusion buy ourselves enough time for people to update
their own installations.

I know there's people here who will jump in saying that the bitcoin
protocol is the behavior of the Satoshi client, period. But which Satoshi
client? 0.7 or 0.8? How do you resolve that without being arbitrary? And
regardless, we are moving very quickly towards a multi-client future. This
problem is very clearly a *bug* in the old codebase. So let's be forward
thinking and do what we would do in any other situation: fix the bug,
responsibly notify people and give them time to react, then move on. Let's
not codify the bug in the protocol.
