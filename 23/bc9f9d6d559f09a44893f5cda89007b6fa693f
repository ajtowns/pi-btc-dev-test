Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Possible change to the MIT license
Message-ID: <CAEPKjgfJxFebb2NaoT1Jet9_wzcpTbQvq0jk+d6Qi6DZExJB=g@mail.gmail.com>

I agree with the opposition on changing the license, because of the
branding attacks.

However having two coins with the same Proof Of Work is a zero sum game
from a security point of view. It may not be a bad idea to consider
changing the license in a way that only limits cryptocurrencies with the
same Proof Of Work, since they directly affect the stability and security
of Bitcoin.
