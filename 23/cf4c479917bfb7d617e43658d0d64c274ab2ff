As Andreas wrote earlier in this thread: "There is no "bare minimum".
Either you implement the "BIP" fully or not."

What you suggest does not follow the principle of least surprise.
Suppose user imports his BIP64 compatible wallet into Electrum, which
claims it is BIP64 compatible, but actually implements just a subset of
the spec (sticking account index to 0). The user now sees just a
fraction of his coins and is puzzled.
