Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal to replace full blockchain with recent
	history plus UTXO Set

 The image at imgur and the pastebin both reference block 542324 but the
correct block is 542322.  As the pastebin shows, the decimal and hex
representations I gave for the block height did not match, and this is
why.  If you use the Merkle root for block 542322 instead of 542324, you'll
be able to see the correct Game of Life play out and make the apron image.
