blockchain.info had some problems here for a while. They were not using a full validating node underneath:

- Signatures were not verified properly. This resulted in some panic when it looked like (on their site) a massive number of very old coins were being spent.

- They were relaying loose coinbase transactions. This caused them to be instantly banned from nodes they were connected to.

So there's certainly some scope for fun with fuzzing those APIs.
