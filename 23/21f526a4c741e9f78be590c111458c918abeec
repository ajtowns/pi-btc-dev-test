Scenario: Users are using some system in a way that the system was not
intended to be used. Let me also further constrain the scenario and
suggest that the function (pretend that means instantaneous confirmed
transactions) that the user wants is impossible. So in this scenario,
is it your job as some developer to change the system to do something
it wasn't designed to do? I mean, you certainly weren't the one
telling them they should accept zero confirmation transactions. Also,
I make no claims as to whether this scenario maps accurately to the
current topic.
