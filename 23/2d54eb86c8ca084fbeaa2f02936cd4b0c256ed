So just design ahead for those future uses. Make the merkle tree:


             root_in_block_header
                     /      \
  tx_data_root      other_root
                               /       \
        segwitness_root     reserved_for_future_use_root

... where reserved_for_future_use is zero until some future block version
(or perhaps better, is just chosen arbitrarily by the miner and sent along
with the block data until some future block version).

That would minimize future disruption of any code that produced or consumed
merkle proofs of the transaction data or segwitness data, especially if the
reserved_for_future_use_root is allowed to be any arbitrary 256-bit value
and not a constant that would get hard-coded into segwitness-proof-checking
code.
