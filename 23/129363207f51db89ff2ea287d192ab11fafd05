Could we just get the forum link removed entirely?  The current Google
search link does very little to disassociate the forum from the Bitcoin
project.  There's no need to have a forum link anyway, as there's
already a link to the wiki, which links to the forum, and can be edited
to link to other unofficial forums as well.

I just came across a thread by someone offering to sell a bitcoin mining
virus:

<http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=21524.0>

I know there'd been complaints about illegal activity, but this is a
whole new level of bad PR compared to people just offering to sell
drugs.  Especially when there are responses like:

"Excuse me while I put this on every computer at my school."

"This would be so awesome if I could install it at every computer in my
college lab. So many bitcoins for me."

It doesn't just look like some one-off cybercriminal spam, it looks like
forum members in general support this kind of thing.
