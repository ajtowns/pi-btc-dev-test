Great! No, I'm not running any node right now at any size.
Take into account that it's not a regular testnet (ie like testnet3),
it's a regtest-like testnet to make mining and simulations cheap.
That also means that anybody can trivially create reorgs, so it is
expected to be used in a controlled environment (you can control which
node creates a new block and when).
