I disagree with the notion of "needed". The blockchain provides utility at
every size, and perhaps more at some sizes than at other sizes, but any
finite size will permit some use cases and not others. This is already the
case and will remain the case. I think the "demand for payments" should be
considered infinite, and some of them will fit on a block chain and pay a
fee for it, and others will need to rely on more efficient, cheaper, but
higher trust systems. You can't use observed usage as a metric for demand
without fixing the cost.

I think available space should grow with technology, to keep the relative
costs to the ecosystem for maintaining a decentralized system constant.
That may or may not lead to a fee market, but I don't think the fee market
is a goal - only a healthy outcome. The goal is an ecosystem that accepts
that the limit to scalability is set by the requirements of a decentralized
system, and its demand - and certainly not perceived demand at potentially
near-zero fee/cost - can't change that.

That's trivially gamable by miners, by filling the blocks with their own
transactions.
