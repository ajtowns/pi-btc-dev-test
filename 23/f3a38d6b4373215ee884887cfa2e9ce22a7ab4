Right now, there seem to be little problems with allocation and viability of
proposed BIPs, with hardly any reviewing/formal allocation being done in
practice. In the past there have been collisions though, and there also have
been nonsensical proposals. I'm in favor of some moderate form of process,
but if the process becomes a burden more than a help, there is clearly a
problem.

It seems there is also little attractiveness to writing BIPs. If many proposals
do not result in useful discussion, there is little incentive to write one
except for those proposals that absolutely need to (p2p protocol, block
validity rules, ...). That's a pity in my opinion - I'd like to see non-core
proposals related to Bitcoin being discussed more often as well.

Agree, I think Bloom filtering should make it into 0.8 - it's a critical
step to make SPV clients more useful for end users.

Regarding ultraprune, there are a few TODOs left:
* Auto-migrate old data (depends on -reindex, for which there is a pullreq)
* UTXO set consistency checks at startup (-checklevel)
