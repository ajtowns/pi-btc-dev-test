Not everyone does crazy clock-changing. Using such a time system for 
scheduling seems to inconvenience the wrong position. (although perhaps 
arguably better since most people probably use DST) :p

(Aside, if Google Calendar can't support standard UTC, that sounds like an 
argument against using Google Calendar...)
