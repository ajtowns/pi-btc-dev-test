How can one construct a zero-trust (or nearly zero trust) namecoin
resolver without having a copy of the ever growing complete namecoin
block chain?

The bitcoin lite node mechanism will not work because a peer could
return stale records or no-result and you would have no evidence of
their deception.  (In the case of lite bitcoin nodes, telling you
about old transactions is harmless because you control your own
transactions).
