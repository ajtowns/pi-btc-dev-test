I agree with Ittay: when bugs are found, they must be fixed ASAP,
expecially when they affect a sensitive sw such as Bitcon; in IT security,
every flaw that is exploitable in abstract, is going to be exploited in
real, sooner or later, also taking into account the increasing parallel
computing power; beware of false sense of security
