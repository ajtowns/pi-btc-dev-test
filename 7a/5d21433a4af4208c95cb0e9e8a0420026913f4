I see a pretty big problem if this really is your insight, the need an 
individual has for running a node is a completely different concept than the 
need for nodes to exist.  And, really, you are describing miners, not nodes.

good thing is that you seem to agree with me as your continue with;

Thats the 'need' I was talking about.
As we concluded in our previous email, the need to run a node is inversely 
proportional to the ability (or willingness) to trust others.
And lets face it, practically everyone trusts others with their money today.

That won't really have any influence, economics 101 says that it doesn't work 
that way.  Lowering the cost on a product won't make it sell more without the 
people wanting or needing the product.

That is your opinion. At least, I don't see that conclusion supported by 
evidence.
I'll defer to Gavins emails that countered this point better.
