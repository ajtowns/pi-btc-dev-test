Good morning Christian,

This is very interesting indeed!

I have started skimming through the paper.

I am uncertain if the below text is correct?

> Throughout this paper we will use the terms *input script* to refer to `witnessProgram` and `scriptPubKey`, and *output script* to refer to the `witness` or `scriptSig`.

Figure 2 contains to what looks to me like a `witnessProgram`, `scriptPubKey`, or `redeemScript` but refers to it as an "output script":

>    OP_IF
>        10 OP_CSV
>        2 As Bs 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY
>    OP_ELSE
>        2 Au Bu 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY
>    OP_ENDIF
