I proposed in my Wildcard Inputs BIP that the version field be split
in two. The first 4 bytes are version number (which in practice is
being used for script version), and the second 4 bits are used for
transaction type.

I don't think the BIP9 mechanism really applies to transactions. A
block is essentially a collection of transactions, therefore voting on
the block applies to the many parties who have transactions in the
block. A transaction on the other hand only effects at most two
parties (the sender and the receiver). In other words, block are
"communal" data structures, transactions are individual data
structures. Also, the nature of soft forks are that wallets can choose
to implement a new feature or not. For instance, if no wallets
implement RBF or SW, then those features effectively don't exist,
regardless of how many nodes have upgraded to handle the feature.

Any new transaction feature should get a new "type" number. A new
transaction feature can't happen until the nodes support it.
