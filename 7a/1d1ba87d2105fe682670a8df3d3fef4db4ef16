There is already an (old) patch that implements that. It won't be
merged, though, until headers-first and parallel block download is in.
Only when the node can download blocks from multiple peers at once it
is really safe to allow limiting rates.

(sure - there are tricks to limit rates anyway, like the script in
contrib/qos, but to have it generally available the block download
needs to be more robust first)
