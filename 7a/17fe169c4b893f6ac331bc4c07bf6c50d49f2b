That is exactly what is stored in the spend-tree.

No but my example shows  that it is up to the miner to choose which tip
to work on. This is not using different rules, it is just optimizing its
income. This means that the economy *does* run on arbitrary "block
preference", even if it is not running on arbitrary rules.

If two blocks are competing, a miner could optimize its decision which
to mine on, not just on whether one of the blocks is his own, but also
on fees, or on excessive validation costs.

I understand "height-based" was not the right wording, as it is of
course branch-specific. Per tip ruleset metadata, must be matched with
per-transaction ruleset metadata.
