Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Signature with negative integer?

Hey all,

I'm wondering if anyone can help explain to me tx 70f7c15c6f62139cc41afa858894650344eda9975b46656d893ee59df8914a3d...

The input signature script is:

304402206b5c3b1c86748dcf328b9f3a65e10085afcf5d1af5b40970d8ce3a9355e06b5b0220cdbdc23e6d3618e47056fccc60c5f73d1a542186705197e5791e97f0e6582a3201 


Which decodes to:

r= 48560432700441876832361368709121298776045893858160378595187765610521057848155

The ECC library I'm using is failing to verify this, which I think makes sense, since I the point needs to be positive, no? But it is obviously valid, as it has been verified and spent. I have tried simply modulo curve.order to positive-ify it, but that didn't seem to work either. Given a point P (with Py < 0) is there some fancy way to bring it into the elliptic curve space, such that Px >= 0 and Py >= 0?

Thanks!
