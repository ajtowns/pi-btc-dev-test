Alright, but even if two (or more) of the change outputs were linked in a future transaction, no-one can tell if they are still linked to your wallet or not unless there is also an additional re-used address on the new transaction input side that has also been previously linked to one of the inputs on the transaction creating the change.


Yes, I understand the additional cost but still thought it worthy of consideration.

This would be really expensive for the network due to the bloat in UTXO
size, a cost everyone has to pay for. Not to mention the fact that it
doesn't really seem that private, as the wallet is likely going to have
to rejoin those inputs in future transactions (and the user will have to
pay a high transaction fee as a result).
