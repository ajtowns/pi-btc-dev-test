I am also seeing these quite bit on my p2pool box.

Right now it is just a bit of (mostly) harmless spam but in the future I
can see this kind of thing being used in DDOS attacks and "deep scans" to
gather information to be used to harm the bitcoin network.  We could easily
block them but then they would just start to spoof regular clients.

We cannot even authenticate them by asking something that only a full
client would know because that would catch out clients sync'ing the
blockchain and SPV clients.

I suspect it is something that is going to have to be dealt with in the
future (I just don't know how yet).  We could start by dropping connections
that send incorrect information (IP addresses of 0.0.0.0 or our own IP).
