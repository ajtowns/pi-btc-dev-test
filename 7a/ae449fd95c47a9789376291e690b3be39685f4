Since these notes have to be redeemed immediately the number of use
cases seems limited. I can't really just hand someone the note and walk
away because they have to scan it to see if it is actually valid.
Otherwise someone could just pass fake notes if they felt the recipient
wouldn't redeem them on the spot. This doesn't seem like an improvement
over just sending the coins via phone.

The use case with poor internet connection wouldn't work as well since,
presumably, the recipient would also have poor reception and couldn't
verify the note was actually loaded with bitcoins.

Also, I REALLY don't like the name bit reserve.
