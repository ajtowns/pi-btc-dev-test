We all want a "good" standard but we have that already, IMHO.

What you are really saying is you want a "better" standard, and I
would argue that's our enemy right now. It's just too easy to propose a
few tweaks, with "wouldn't it be better if..." 

I feel strongly we are entering the "design by committee" territory with BIP174.

I have personally implemented this spec on an embedded micro, as
the signer and finalizer roles, and written multiple parsers for
it as well. There is nothing wrong with it, and it perfectly meets
my needs as a hardware wallet.

So, there is a good proposal already spec'ed and implemented by
multiple parties. Andrew has been very patiently shepherding the PR
for over six months already.

PSBT is something we need, and has been missing from the ecosystem
for a long time. Let's push this out and start talking about future
versions after we learn from this one.
