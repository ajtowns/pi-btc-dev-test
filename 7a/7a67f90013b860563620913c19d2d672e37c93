Safety increases with more lead-in time.  If the reference client was
updated so that the hard fork happened in two years, it would be pretty
safe.  Miners would have time to update.

If miners (or the community) objected, it is sort of like a game of chicken.

This is one of the problems with not making decisions in advance, the
resulting hard fork is inherently safer.
