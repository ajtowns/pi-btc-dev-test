Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Move authorative source for BIPs to git
	repository
Message-ID: <CA+s+GJCuWNj7LuLJy4rSkN_t0qgO3UsBS2hEBTgm6DiiQyqbVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

A while ago after discussion on the mailing list a repository was set up to
store the BIP documents, as this is deemed a more secure solution than
having them on the wiki:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips

To prevent confusion the next step should probably be to replace the BIPs
on the wiki with links to the github documents, with a notice that changes
should be proposed on github or mailed to the BIP editor (gmaxwell).

Agreed?

Regards,
Wladimir
