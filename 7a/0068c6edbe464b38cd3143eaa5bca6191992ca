If you were merely attaching your public key to them, then the email server could have been systematically replacing your public key with some other public key, and then, when you would later try to provide a signature, your signature would not verify under the public key that everyone else had been seeing attached to your messages.

If the server could replace the public key, it could replace the
signature in all the same places.

Please, can this stuff move to another list? It's offtopic.
