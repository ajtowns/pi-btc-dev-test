Please Peter Todd explain here all what you want to say about a patent of a
hardware design for an ASIC.

Remember that ASICBoost is not the only patent out there, there are at
least three similar patents, filed by major Bitcoin ASIC manufacturers in
three different countries, on similar technologies.

That suggest that the problem is not ASICBoot's: you cannot blame any
company from doing lawful commerce in a FREE MARKET.

It is a flaw in Bitcoin design that could be corrected if the guidelines I
posted in [1] had been followed.
