A Mt-Gox-scale incident was inevitable and there are probably more hard 
lessons in the future.  But it has made bitcoin much better already.  
I'm referring to things like malleability fixes, cleaning house at the

people than before understand the distinction you're making, and they 
are sharing the lesson.
