The employer example actually shows something important: between a worker and
an employer double-spending already irrelevant. People get paid after they work
their two weeks not before, so the double-spend is already irrelevant.

However when your employer pays you on the blockchain until the transaction
confirms for someone else to accept funds from that payment they not only have
to trust you, but also the employer. Sure they could take it as "you said you
would apy me so it is your responsibility to make that happen" but that brings
a whole new level of complexity.

A scheme where you vouch for your payments with your identity can benifit from
being able to follow that chain all the way back to the last confirmed
transaction, although actually implementing this may be too complex to be
worthwhile, especially initially.

Yes. But the issue is how are you going to optmize it? By adding yet more
restrictions and limitations on those who chose to run a node or mining
operation, or by actually fixing the trust issue? We know you can do the
latter, so do not sacrifice Bitcoin's core layer in silly attempts to make
double-spends harder. Fundementally Bitcoin has exactly one way of achieving
consensus, and that is the blockchain.

It must be your right to chose what transactins you chose to mine and chose to
relay. End of story. Bitcoin is not about imposing regulation on those who
choose to use it.

Indeed. Especially for the most popular use of Bitcoin as a payment system:
buying things PayPal won't let you. In that circumstance the only leverage you
have is the protections of the blockchain and the damage you can do to the
other (often anonymous) parties reputation.
