I should add that hard forks do provide us with a means to determine 
whether or not miners are enforcing the new rules...but generally 
speaking they risk far greater disruption if anything fails to go as 
planned. Between the risk of clients accepting an occasional invalid 
"confirmation" or two and the risk of a total network partition, the 
former seems far less serious. I believe the concerns regarding old 
clients can be remedied to a very large extent by means of a good 
awareness campaign.
