Subject: [bitcoin-dev]  Services bit for xthin blocks
Message-ID: <CAHUwRvuR9qtYc+rVh1yPbQoESxm4m0r6a+Fd6VF=FuT0vom_HQ@mail.gmail.com>

The Bitcoin Unlimited client needs a services bit to indicate that the node
is capable of communicating thin blocks.  We propose to use bit 4 as AFAIK
bit 3 is already earmarked for Segregated Witness.
