Agreed. But I believe the economic and security arguments I gave regarding fees and incentives still hold and are largely separate from the scalability issue. Please correct me if I overlooked something.

An increase in block size at this time will exacerbate security concerns around nodes relying on other nodes to validate (particularly miners and wallets). It?s not really a matter of having limited developer resources that need to be budgeted, as you seem to suggest.

Regarding developments on properly handling fees, there must exist the economic need for it before there?s an earnest effort to solve it. Increasing the block size right now will, in all likelihood, delay this effort. I?d much prefer to first let the fee market evolve because it?s a crucial component to the protocol?s design and its security model?and so we can get a better sense for fee economics. Then we might be able to figure out better approaches to block size changes in the future that makes sense economically?perhaps with mechanisms that can dynamically adjust it to reflect resource availability and network load.
