Miners cannot change the block size or any other rule without support of
the users, because their blocks and coins would be rejected. This
mechanism that Bitcoin brought us, has been working fine and I see no
reason to change it with utxo bits.
I *only* propose an optional way  to synchronize changes without the
need of off chain agreements, which seems like a simple improvement over
the current situation.

I agree that the user agent signalling isn't very important, and I think
that most of us aware that you cannot rely on counting them.
