Hi Pavel,

(my earlier email was moderated, so the list can only see it via your
reply),

Yes, an attacker could try and send malicious data to take advantage of
a compression library vulnerability...  but is it that much worse than
existing attack vectors which might also result in denial of service,
crashes, remote execution?

Peter, perhaps your BIP can look at possible ways to isolate the
decompression phase, such as having incoming compressed blocks be saved
to a quarantine folder and an external process/daemon decompress and
verify the block's hash?

Regards,
Simon
