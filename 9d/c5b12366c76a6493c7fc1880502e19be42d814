I've now added explanation to the README, reorganized the files, and added
some comments:

In fact, I'd suggest that for things like edge cases, you test edge cases in

The tests work by doing a lot of exercising on pseudorandom data, an
approach which does a good job of hitting all the lines of code and edge
cases and requiring very little updating as the implementation changes, at
the expense of it taking a while for tests to run. The advantage of very
custom unit tests is that they run almost instantly, at the cost of
requiring painstaking maintenance and missing more stuff. I've come to
favor this approach in my old age.

The proportion of code devoted to tests is more than it looks like at first
blush, because all the audit methods are just for testing.
