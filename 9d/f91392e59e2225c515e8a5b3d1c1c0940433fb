Hi Walter,

This could be of interest to the XChange project. See GitHub:
https://github.com/timmolter/XChange

The aim of this project is to provide a unifed API for applications to
access financial exchanges. At present it supports Bitcoin exchanges (MtGox
and Intersango are the primary focus with others to follow). It is in the
very early stages of development, but is likely to be integrated into the
MultiBit Bitcoin client (see http://multibit.org) in the near future (early
prototypes are available directly from sources).

One problem that the XChange development team faces is that each exchange
rolls its own data model and uses its own protocol (web socket, socket IO,
direct socket and so on). To provide a reference implementation of how an
exchange should publish its data would be beneficial.

Kind regards,

Gary
