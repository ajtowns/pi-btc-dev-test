Maybe I didn't make it clear, but the distinction is that the current track
allocates
one service bit for each "filter type", where it has to be agreed upon up
front what
elements such a filter type contains.

My suggestion was to advertise a bitfield for each filter type the node
serves,
where the bitfield indicates what elements are part of the filters. This
essentially
removes the notion of decided filter types and instead leaves the decision
to
full-nodes.

This would require a "getcftypes" message, of course.
