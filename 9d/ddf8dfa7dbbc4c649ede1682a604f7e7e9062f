No problem. Thanks for the detailed replies.

Libbitcoin (for example) supports client-server features on an independent port (and implements a variant of CurveCP for encryption and identity). My concern arises with application of identity to the P2P protocol (excluding Bloom filter features).

I have referred to the Bloom filters messages. These are clearly asymmetric in nature. Despite being possible it is not a valid use case for a full node to make BF requests to another node.

One client to multiple servers is still client-server for the sake of this discussion. The nature of the P2P protocol is synchronization of content between all nodes/peers. If the protocol is asymmetric the semantics, and therefore use cases, are different.

FWIW posting a transaction to the network can be done using the P2P protocol, connecting for a short period of time. But this is also a client-server scenario and is a hack when done (full disclosure, bx provides both P2P and client-server commands for tx posting). Broadcasting is naturally the behavior of a full node.

Yes, this is necessarily the case in order to prevent a MITM attack. This is the basis of my concern.

Sure, but then let us not make assumptions about it in the context of this discussion. Libbitcoin provides fee estimation by monitoring broadcast penetration using a client-server protocol with an optional subscription mechanism.

TOFU cannot prevent MITM attacks (the goal of the encryption). Authentication requires a secure (trusted) side channel by which to distribute public keys. This presents what I consider a significant problem. If widespread, control over this distribution network would constitute control over who can use Bitcoin.

The effort to prevent censorship could actually enable it. I don't think it would get that far. Someone would point this out in the process of vetting the authentication BIP, and the result would be the scrapping of BIP151.

BIP 151 is incomplete without authentication.

Agree, but my problem is that I do not believe we can assume this is a solvable problem.

Understood, yet this is the basis of my blind alley comment.
