The key to understanding how it works is to stop thinking in terms of a block size limit, but rather a block weight limit. 1 byte of witness data counts as 1 weight, the rest counts for 4 weight. A block must be less than 4 million weight. There's no separate limits at all, so any saving in the witness space (e.g. through signature aggregation) is useful for both witness/non-witness data.
