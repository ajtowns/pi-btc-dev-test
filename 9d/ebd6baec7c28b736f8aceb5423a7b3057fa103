Ideally, the metrics that we settle on would be architecture agnostic and have some sort of conversion metric to map it onto any specific architecture. An Intel based architecture is going to perform vastly different from an ARM based one for example.

Simple example: The PS3 PPE and Xbox 360 CPU are RISC processors that run at 3.2GHz, but their non-vector performance is rather poor. You?d be lucky to get about 33% effective utilization out of them (up to 50%, tops, but that?s really pushing it), so if you were to map this onto another architecture, you?d have at least a 3x conversion from this end alone (the other end could also have a scaling factor).

Ultimately, how these values are expressed isn?t the important part. It?s the ability to measure the impact of a change that?s important. If some metric changes by, say, 5%, then it doesn?t really matter if it?s expressed in MIPS, INTOPS, MB or GB. The fact that it changed is what matters and what the effect is on the baseline (that ultimately could be expressed as a certain specific hardware configuration). It would probably be practical to have a number of comparable concrete min spec configurations and even more ideal would be if people in the community would have these systems up and running to do actual on-target performance benchmarks.

This may be much lower performance than desirable, however, it means that we don't lock people into using large-vendor chipsets which have unknown, or known to be bad, security properties such as Intel AMT.
