Then we are to start issuing a new BIP for every node's policy? This has no 
end - though it might make sense for an independent and updated database. 
Mixing protocol standards with policy suggestions makes a very risky situation 
where one can potentially hold a miner liable for not enforcing the BIP; ie, 
government regulation of Bitcoin itself. I don't think most people want to go 
there...
