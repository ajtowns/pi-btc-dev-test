Multibit is adding detection of the NODE_BLOOM bit in the next 2-3 weeks.

SPV is kinda broken if the wallet doesn?t do this detection. If your wallet connects only to nodes that don?t support bloom filtering, the wallet never gets updates. We have had a spike in users reporting that their wallet isn't getting updated. To compound the problem, they rescan the blockchain and lose all of their transaction history. It has caused much panic among less technical users.

We believe that failing to detect the NODE_BLOOM bit is the culprit, although it is non-deterministic, so we aren't certain.

I imagine that other SPV wallets are having similar issues. BIP 111 really isn?t optional at this point, so it should be marked final.
