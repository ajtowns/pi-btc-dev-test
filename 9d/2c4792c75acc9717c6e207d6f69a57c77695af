Thanks Peter for your prompt reply.

And now that I think of it you're right - as easy as it is for us to
differentiate OP_RETURN outputs that contain the Po.et prefix it would be
for miners to block those transactions altogether. Is this what you mean?

Still, a prefix is something we may have to live with for a little while
until we can address that issue.

Is there a formal / standard process to claim it we should follow?
