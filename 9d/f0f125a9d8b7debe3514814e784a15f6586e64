That's a nice and concise way to put it and any potential protocol 
documentation should start with a statement like that.

One interesting question is whather alternative implementations are more 
likely to get it wrong because the protocol description is wrong or 
because the authors misunderstood the reference implementation source code.

Extensive documentation of the source code, a la Knuth's literate 
programming, may be some kind of a middle ground.

Ok. Several people expressed an interest in the topic, so I'll give it a 
try and see how it fares.
