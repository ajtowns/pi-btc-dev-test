If I don't see how switching from using the thousands of fully-validating
bitcoin nodes with (tens? hundreds?) of Lightning Network hubs is better in
terms of decentralization (or security, in terms of Sybil/DoS attacks),
then I doubt other people do, either. You need to do a better job of
explaining it.

But even if you could convince me that it WAS better from a
security/decentralization point of view:

a) Lightning Network is nothing but a whitepaper right now. We are a long
way from a practical implementation supported by even one wallet.

b) The Lightning Network paper itself says bigger blocks will be needed
even if (especially if!) Lightning is wildly successful.
