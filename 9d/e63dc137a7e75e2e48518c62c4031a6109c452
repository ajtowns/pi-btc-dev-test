I have a rather off-beat suggestion. Perhaps decimal was not satoshi's intention.

In old English money 1 guinea is 21 shillings. I wonder if 1 million guineas is more or less the total number of bitcoins = 21 million shillings. There was also the notion of bits (two bob bits = 1 florin = 2 shillings). I quite like the idea as it's absolutely not expected.

Old English money is a funny mix of decimal and imperial (base12) measures but may have some interesting properties, one of which would be to have multiple names for overlapping "layers" not just the 2 or 3 that has been mentioned here and elsewhere.

I wonder in the long run if this will not just naturally occur anyway.

Regards

If most of the wallets start displaying amounts in ?BTC quantities, it will be obvious that a ?BTC is a different magnitude than a BTC.  Nobody is going to look at their 100,000 ?BTC balance and think they have 100,000 BTC. People will immediately make the mental adjustment to the new order of magnitude even if they don't specifically know that ? means micro, or that micro means 1e-6.
