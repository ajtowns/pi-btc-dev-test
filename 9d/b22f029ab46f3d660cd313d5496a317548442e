 When I say de-centralized I mean it, all the things you listed are centralized. Reddit is actually a purely centralized system and just as unhealthy as the current bitcoin forum. We have the technology, I'm simply putting together the pieces that other people have already built. This forum will literally be uncontrollable in raw form, once it's unleashed it can't be stopped. It will exist on thousands of computers so it cannot be destroyed, it will not be centrally hosted. 

I expect users to create their own external software to parse the data, so people can centralize as much or as little as they want in their own 'sub-forums' built on this system. I will be releasing some very rudimentary external software/website to go along with this de-centralized system just so people can post and read what's posted, and will worry about the finer details at a later time.

There will be various leaders who utilize this program and organize quality forums, but fundamentally the raw de-centralized system cannot be controlled, so people posting to it will always have a venue to speak without being censored.

I actually started this project to create a journal of uncensored scientific research, but it didn't take long to realize this sort've thing is useful for pretty much everyone, so I'm rushing the basic release out. Then I will work on making my science journal 'sub-forum' software and everyone else can do whatever they want.

Zander is working on the same thing:
https://www.reddit.com/r/AetheralResearch/

But it's actually quite difficult
to make it truly censorship-resistant: both in solving the theymos factor and
spam/abuse/overloading as an attack.

We have /r/bitcoinxt and so far it has been great. But we also need
a regular forum.

Roger Ver controls bitcoin.com, as I understand?
https://bitcoin.com/forum/ would be nice.

And it must be a real community,
not "say whatever you want because free speech". We've seen how that turned out
to be.

Something like battle.net or Steam forums: heavily moderated, not for
opinions, but for spam/noise/insults.

Again, this needs leadership. Anyone
can install a forum software, what is needed is an "official seal of approval"
and regular presence of top XT people there.

And a will to setup proper
moderation. Then people will move.
