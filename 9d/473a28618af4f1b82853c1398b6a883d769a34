Low light shouldn't be an issue for QRcodes generated by phones. They have
backlit screens that should always be bright enough. I can see how it might
be an issue for printed codes.

If your phone has no Bitcoin app installed then being redirected to an
invoice page is pretty useless, you still won't be able to pay the bill no
matter what (where do you get the money from?). If they are just raw HTTP
URLs then it means the effect of scanning a QRcode with a standalone
scanner app is different to scanning it inside the wallet, which is unlike
all other uses of QRcodes I know of. So I'm not really convinced by that UX
yet. Perhaps we can thrash it out in Amsterdam. Right now I'm thinking
QRcodes should always contain bitcoin URIs.
