This is completely wrong. SPV wallets will work as normal without upgrade. Full nodes will only provide transactions to SPV in a format they understand, and SPV will accept the transaction since they are not doing any validation anyway. 

The only reason an end user may want to upgrade is for lower transaction fee when they are sending transaction. If they don't upgrade, that means the fee is too low for them to care, which is a good news
