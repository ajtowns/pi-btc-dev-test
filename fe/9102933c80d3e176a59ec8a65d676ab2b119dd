How do you compute s = x*e if e is an element of group G?
(Similar question: How do you verify if e is element of G?)

Are you aware of 
 http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2001/corr2001-13.ps ?
This is a threshold signature scheme for Schnorr signatures, so what
you want is possible already with Schnorr signatures.

Best,
Tim
