?If you're waiting for one confirmation, something like that works -- you
might from 95% chance of 10 minutes 5% chance of 20 minutes to 100% chance
of 10m30s. But if you want 144 confirmations (eg) you go from 95% chance of
1 day, 5% chance of 1 day 10 minutes; to 100% chance of 1 day 72 minutes.

Once blocksizes had normalised as much larger than 1MB with a corresponding
higher average hashrate, a bad actor could easily mine a raft of valid
empty/small blocks at the minimum hash rate and force a reorg (and do
doublespends, etc).
