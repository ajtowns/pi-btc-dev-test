Hi,

Well, depends on your model and what you want to achieve. That would
depend on each wallet, I couldn't confirm nor deny that this is or isn't
true. You have to check with your wallet how it handles transactions
with nLockTime. Maybe you are the one who generates the nLockTime
transaction,  but that needs to be broadcasted by the payee (your
recipient) when the locktime expires?

One way I would use nLockTime is to have the tx generated, and keep it
somewhere not related to my wallet(s) until the nLockTime expires, then
I can broadcast it to the network by /sendrawtransaction and have it
mined and included into a block.
