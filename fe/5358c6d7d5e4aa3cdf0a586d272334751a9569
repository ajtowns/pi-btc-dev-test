To clarify (and not piss off ThomasV :-): I do not think the idea of
having servers with a reputation of their own is a passed stage. There
are many things that cannot be done at SPV level security with just
the P2P protocol yet. So having fewer but more trusted Electrum
servers is a reasonable compromise.

But for basic wallet functionality it isn't necessary.
