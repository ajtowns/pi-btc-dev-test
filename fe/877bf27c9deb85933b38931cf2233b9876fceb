Also consider that currently there are many people have already
demonstrated a willingness to donate bandwidth and resources to the
public by running nodes, so those people aren't going to disappear.

They could operate mixed-mode nodes, with a fraction of the allowed
incoming connections reserved for free peer, with free connections
might be limited in terms of time duration. Bitcoin-accepting
brick-and-mortars would probably allow free access to anyone connected
to their internal wifi to facilitate people wanting to pay.

Crowdfunded free bridges, assurance contracts, etc are all other ways
to let people get into the network with no upfront cost.
