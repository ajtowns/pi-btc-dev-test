Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Suggestion: allow receivers to pay
 optional fee for transactions without fees

You can create a transaction which spends the output to yourself, attaching
a fee to that transaction. In order for miners to grab the transaction fee
on that transaction, they would have to also mine the original transaction.
Likely, you'd have to do this by hand, but software could be written to
simplify doing it. No protocol changes needed.
