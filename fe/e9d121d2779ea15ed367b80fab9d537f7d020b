Absolutely.  It wholly depends on the security model, and
economic-incentives model.  Some use models simply don't care if the
miner created a transaction that gave the fee to themselves.  It might
even be /encouraged/ to do this!  Sure they are paying themselves, but
given bitcoin network difficulty is so high, simply obtaining
payments-go-myself-as-miner transactions is itself difficult.
Producing an identity (my goal) or whatever is just fine, and in such
case becomes simply an additional block reward -- an additional
incentive to buy into this identity creation/management system.

Or exchange "identity" with another token, for another data service of
your choice.

This is no longer a strict "proof of sacrifice" system, if such
behavior is encouraged, but it is nonetheless valid.
