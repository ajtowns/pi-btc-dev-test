Hi Warren,

I submitted a public apology for a false accusation I leveled at
Sergio Lerner but my message was bounced by the list.

Can you please confirm if there is a know reason for this.

I had also sent the message to his personal email account, but I think
it is important that a public apology be made as soon as possible, in
the interest of goodwill and setting the record straight.

regards,
Venzen Khaosan
