 - Full nodes already perform many valuable services, and simply allowing
people to pay for better service is something operators can do now - even
without it being baked into bitcoind.   Paying for access to a higher-speed
relay network, for example, is something that many operators would do.

- Baking in the ability to add service fees could make more people *want*
to run more high quality, highly available full nodes... which is really
one of the most important things developers can be doing.
