Note that this fix can be designed to retain the possibility of
validationless mining, by allowing empty blocks to be created if the
previous witness data proof is omitted. This would achieve the same goal
as Gregory Maxwell's blockchain verification flag(1) but with
significantly less ability/reason to lie about the status of that flag.
