It is frustrating to answer questions that we answered months ago,
especially when I linked to these in response to your recent "increase
advocates say that not increasing the max block size will KILL BITCOIN"
false claim:
  http://gavinandresen.ninja/why-increasing-the-max-block-size-is-urgent
  https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32

Executive summary: when networks get over-saturated, they become
unreliable.  Unreliable is bad.

Unreliable and expensive is extra bad, and that's where we're headed
without an increase to the max block size.

RE: the recent thread about "better deal with that type of thing now rather
than later" :  exactly the same argument can be made about changes needed
to support a larger block size-- "better to do that now than to do that
later."  I don't think either of those arguments are very convincing.
