I don't think anyone is mining using bitcoind 0.7 or later? Deepbit is the 
only pool I know of using bitcoind at all, and it's based on 0.3.21 (or about 
that)...

p2pool has supported v2 blocks since 2012 Aug 8.
Eloipool has supported v2 blocks since 2012 Sep 1.
slush's stratum server has supported v2 blocks since it was written.

I'm not aware of any other maintained open source poolservers.
At least PoolServerJ and ecoinpool are known to break when v2 blocks become 
mandatory.
