I just mocked this idea up last week, though I assumed a cruder system of "voting" to an address that corresponds to a feature -- literally, voting with your wallet (for your wallet, ad infinitum).

Sorry for the persistent hand-holding requests, but some advice would be very welcome.

Well, let's assume that our "public good" is based on the 5-step model described here:
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_3:_Assurance_contracts

This good corresponds to something like "Facebook contact synchronization" and has a target of 50 BTC, though we also want to be able to take more if people are willing to give it.

I suppose I'm trying to twist your arm for an example, and maybe an anecdote. How would we do it? Does it require the donors to do anything esoteric? I saw "but they do not broadcast it" -- does this happen automatically when coins are sent to that address, for example?
