It seems to me we're confusing two completely different motivations for
double-spending. One is the ability to replace a fee, the other is the
ability to replace outputs.

If the double-spend were to merely add or remove inputs (but keep at least
one input in common, of course), it seems fairly safe to assume it's the
former, a genuine fee replacement. Even allowing for things like coinjoin,
none of the payees would really care either way.

Conversely, if at least one of the inputs were kept but none of the outputs
were, we can be confident it's the the latter.

It is possible to build a wallet that always does the former when doing fee
replacement by using another transaction to create an output with exactly
the additional desired fee.

If we can clearly distinguish these two cases then the fee replacement case
can be handled by relaying both and letting miners pick one or the other
while the output replacement case could be handled by rewarding everything
to a miner (essentially all outputs are voided...made unredeemable...and
all inputs are added to coinbase) if the miner includes the two conflicting
transactions in the same block.

Wouldn't this essentially solve the problem?
