This proposal seems hopelessly broken.

Who decides on which companies are eligible?  Is there some kind of
centralized database that one registers?  Who administers this?  What is to
stop someone from creating a million fake companies to sway the voting?
How does a company make it's vote?  How does one verify that the person
voting on behalf of a company is actually the correct person?
