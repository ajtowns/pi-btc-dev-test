> Err, no, that's what happens when you double click the Ethereum icon

instead of the Bitcoin icon.  Just because you run "Bitcoin SPV"
instead of "Bitcoin Verify Everyone's Else's Crap" doesn't mean you're
somehow going to get Ethereum payments.  Your verification is just
different and the risks that come along with that are different.  It's
only confusing if you make it confusing.

This is false. You could get coins which don't even exist  as long as a miner mined the invalid transaction.
Peter Todd has demonstrated this on mainstream SPV wallets,
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/peter-todds-fraud-proofs-talk-mit-bitcoin-expo-2016-mark-morris

The only reason SPV wallets do not accept ethereum payments is because of transaction/block format differences.
SPV wallets have no clue what is a valid bitcoin, they trust miners fully.

In the event of a hardfork, SPV wallets will blindly follow the longest chain.

> If every block that is mined for them is deliberately empty because of
an attacker, that's nonfunctional.  You can use whatever semantics you
want to describe that situation, but that's clearly what I meant.

Not sure why you are bringing this up, this is not the case today nor does it have anything to do with blocksize.

> As above, if someone operates Bitcoin in SPV mode they are not
magically at risk of getting Dashcoins.  They send and receive
Bitcoins just like everyone else running Bitcoin software.  There's no
confusion about it and it doesn't have anything to do with hashrates
of anyone.

As mentioned earlier, you are at risk of receiving made up money.
SPV has everything to do with hashrate, it trusts hashrate fully.
Crafting a bitcoin transaction paying you money that i do not have is not difficult, as long as a miner mines a block with it, your SPV wallet will accept it.

> The debate is a choice between nodes paying more to allow greater growth and adoption,
or nodes constraining adoption in favor of debatable security
concerns.

Onchain transactions are not the only way to use Bitcoin the currency.
Trades you do on an exchange are not onchain, yet transacted with Bitcoin.

> And even if there was, the software would choose it for you?

People choose the software, not the other way round.

> Yes you do, if the segment options are known (and if they aren't,
running a node likely won't help you choose either, it will choose by
accident and you'll have no idea).  You would get to choose whose
verifications to request/check from, and thus choose which segment to
follow, if any.

SPV does not decide, they follow longest chain.
Centralised/Server based wallets follow the server they are connecting to.
Full Nodes do not depend on a 3rd party to decide if the money received is valid.

>  Are you really this dense?  If the cost of on-chain transactions
rises, numerous use cases get killed off.  At $0.10 per tx you
probably won't buy in-game digital microtransactions with it, but you
might buy coffee with it.  At $1 per tx, you probably won't buy coffee
with it but you might pay your ISP bill with it.  At $20 per tx, you
probably won't pay your ISP bill with it, but you might pay your rent.
At $300 per tx you probably won't use it for anything, but a company
purchasing goods from China might.  At $4000 per tx that company
probably won't use it, but international funds settlement for
million-dollar transactions might use it.
> At each fee step along the way you kill of hundreds or thousands of
possible uses of Bitcoin.  Killing those off means fewer people will
use it, so they will use something else instead.

No need to get personal.
As mentioned earlier, all these low value transactions can happen offchain.
None of the use cases will be killed off. We have sub dollar trades happening on exchanges offchain.

> The average person doesn't need that level of security.

Precisely why they do not need to be on-chain.

It is clear to me that you have not yet grasped Bitcoin's security model, especially the role Full-Nodes play in it.
Id suggest you do some more reading up and thinking about it.
Do thought experiments and take it to the extremes where nobody runs a node, what can miners do now which they could not do before?
Why don't exchanges run SPV nodes?

Further correspondence will not be fruitful until you grasp this.

It will be of little use to have thousands on independent miners/pools  if 3 large pools make up 51% of hash rate and collude to attack the network.

While  Bitcoin borrows useful features from gold, it has more possible uses, including uses that were never possible before Bitcoin existed, and we believe that gives it huge potential.
> > The ability of other systems to do transactions, like visa or cash, come with the limitations of those systems.  Bitcoin was designed to break those limitations and STILL provide the ability to do transactions.  We might all agree Bitcoin isn't going to ever solve the microtransaction problem, at least not on-chain, but saying Bitcoin doesn't need utility is just foolish.  Gold doesn't need utility, gold has 4,000 years of history.  We don't.

Someone else solving our problem may very well be Ethereum, and "solving it for us" is pulling Bitcoin investments, users and nodes away into Ethereum.

Since miners also have a node endpoint, they can cut the node users out of the equation by linking with eachother directly - something they already do out of practicality for propagation.  Node users do not have the power to arbitrate consensus, that is why we have blocks and PoW.

It matters not how much hash power is behind a inflationary supply chain fork, full nodes protect the user from the change of any properties of Bitcoin which they do not agree with. The ability to retain this power for users is of prime importance and is arguably what gives Bitcoin most of it's value. Any increase in the cost to run a full node is an increase in cost to maintain monetary sovereignty. The ability for a user to run a node is what keeps the miners honest and prevents them from rewriting any of Bitcoin's rules.

By all means, we should look into ways of solving the problem. But all these debates around blocksize is a total waste of time. Even if we fork to 2MB, 5MB, 10MB. It is irrelevant in the larger picture, transaction capacity will still be too low for global usage in the medium-long term. The additional capacity from blocksize increases are linear improvements with very large systemic costs compared with the userbase and usage which is growing exponentially. Lightning potentially offers a couple or orders of magnitude of scaling and will make blocksize a non-issue for years to come. Even if it fails to live up to the hype, you should not discount the market innovating solutions when there is money to be made.
