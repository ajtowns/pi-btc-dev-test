Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Minimum Block Size
Message-ID: <CAG86ZOzEnjMw4xam5oUuuvyfoAps=47j418cZcw9BLs-yUCB2g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

as with the current "max block size" debate I was wondering: Is anyone here
in favor of a minimum block size (say 2 MB or so)? If so I would be
interested in an exchange (maybe off-list) of ideas. I am in favor of a
lower limit and am giving it quite a bit of thought at the moment.

Cheers

Levin
