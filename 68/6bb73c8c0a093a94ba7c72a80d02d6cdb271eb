Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Alert key retirement?
Message-ID: <CABaSBawgieWrPmB5g5xnn5n4CfePpqvgV-Cg+w0P0n6tX-NHfg@mail.gmail.com>

Alert key has yet to be disclosed. The alert system itself has been retired
for quite a while now. More information about this can be found here:
https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2016-11-01-alert-retirement
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-September/013104.html

Recently it was suggested to me that it would be helpful to wait for v0.13
end-of-life before revealing the alert keys.

I am seeking information regarding anyone that has requested final alert
messages for any particular projects that may have copied the bitcoin alert
pubkey.

Thank you.
