Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 65 and OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY inquiry...
Message-ID: <63C13C3D-5333-4DEA-A42F-A4685DDE09DA@ricmoo.com>

Heya,

I was wondering about BIP 65 regarding the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, and thought it might make more sense to instead have a OP_CHECKLOCKTIME which would simply push an OP_TRUE or OP_FALSE onto the stack?

That way someone could include multiple OP_CHECKLOCKTIME conditions in a single script. It is trivial to always emulate OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by using a OP_CHECKLOCKTIME OP_VERIFY sequence.


As a second question, would it possibly make more sense to, rather than relying on the nLockTime in a transaction, allow an opcode that would use similar semantics, but against an item in the stack? Then you could essentially include multiple nLockTimes in a single script and make arbitrarily interesting (complicated?) scripts based on block height and/or block timestamp.

The OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY can still be easily implemented, by using

nLockTimeThatWouldBeInTx OP_CHECKLOCKTIME OP_VERIFY


Just something that came to mind while reading about OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.

Thanks,

RicMoo
