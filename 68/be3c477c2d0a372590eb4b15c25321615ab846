That means that for an average transaction, you will need a cross-chain transfer in order to get the money to the recipient (as their wallet will usually be associated to a chain that is different from your own).

I think we should set the right incentives to invalidate these assumptions. If the fees as well as the security guarantees
on the main chain are highest and fees are dropping with the distance from the main chain on each level of side chains,
wouldn't communities with many internal transactions create their own side chain with low fees? I'd expect geographic
as well as virtual communities to be forming enjoying cheap fees on their 'local' chains and expensive but comparabily rare
'long distance' fees. One would expect geographic chains (e.g. continents) as well as virtual ones (e.g. the Open Bazaar
users' chain) to form. To save fees, a typical user would maintain a wallet in each of her communities which are loaded
and drained with rare expensive transacations, whereas daily business with many transactions is done cheaply within
each community chain. So, indeed, I would argue that side chains equipped with the right cost incentives for cross-chain
transactions would lead to a scalable and efficiently self-organizing network of side chains.

best regards,
Martin
