When I looked up that IP address, the Whois info names "OVH" and "Octave
Klaba" (who founded OVH, according to Wikipedia) as the owner.  "
blockchain.info" appears in the HTML header as retrieved by the
"Anti-Hacker Alliance" (
http://anti-hacker-alliance.com/index.php?details=37.187.136.15).
Blockchain.info itself returns IP addresses managed by CloudFlare whenever
I try it.
