> What do you think a big-integer division by a word-sized divisor *is*? Obviously rolling your own is always an option. Are you just saying that Base58 encoding and decoding is easier than Shamir's Secret Sharing because the divisors are small?

Well, yes, to be fair, in fact it is.  The small divisor and lack of
modulo arithmetic make base-58 encoding and decoding noticeably
smaller and easier than Shamir's Secret Sharing over GF(P256).
