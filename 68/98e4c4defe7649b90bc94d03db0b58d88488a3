I have put it on the github: 
https://github.com/jl2012/bips/blob/master/hardforkbit.mediawiki

I removed the specification of coinbase message to make it simpler. 
Instead, it requires that a flag block must not be shared by multiple 
hardfork proposals.

I'm not sure whether it is a Standard, Informational, or Process BIP

I'm also thinking whether we should call it "hardfork bit", "hardfork 
flag", or with other name.
