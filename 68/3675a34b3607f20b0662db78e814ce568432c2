I'm cautious of using human-meaningful identifiers, especially any that 
might require a central repository, due to name collisions. Examples 
that could be complicated include BitcoinDark, Litedoge, and other names 
that base on existing coins. I think the ability to differentiate 
between test networks is also useful.

Could certainly just use the genesis hash as network ID, that would 
work. Bit long, but suspect 64 bytes isn't the end of the world! I'll 
see if any more responses come in then raise a BIP for using genesis 
hash as an alternative to short names.
