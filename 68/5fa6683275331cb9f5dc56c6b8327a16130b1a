It looks like the packet format statsd expects is rather simple - it should
be easy to experiment with.

Perhaps a good next step would be to improve your patch so that someone can
get a feed of the stats packets via TCP by e.g. ssh tunnelling to their
host. Once it's easy to get a feed of simple stats packets, people can
easily experiment with different kinds of aggregation and monitoring
software from their desktop.
