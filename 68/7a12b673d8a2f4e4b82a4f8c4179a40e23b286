I'm pleased to announce the newest contender in the field of decentralized
e-commerce. 100% P2P and 100% customize-able. Using METAmarket, you can
create your own market where you make the rules. Open to all or Private?
Wholesale or retail? Moderated or unmoderated? Clearnet or Darknet? You
are in complete control of your local market. There are always people
looking for cheap and easy ways to trade and METAmarket uses a zero-fee
approach. All funds are secure from theft or exit scams using a P2P
Bitcoin multisig escrow between buyer and seller ONLY. (NO third parties!)
METAmarket is built directly on top of the Bitcoin and Bitmessage
reference clients, keeping security as priority #1. The future of
e-commerce under your control. The future of e-commerce is METAmarket.
