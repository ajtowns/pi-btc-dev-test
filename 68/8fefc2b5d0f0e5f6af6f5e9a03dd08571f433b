I think you're misunderstanding the point. The way you get IsStandard
changed is that you make an application-oriented BIP detailing the use
of some new standard transaction type (say, generalized hash-locked
transactions for atomic swaps). We then discuss that proposal for its
technical merits and reach consensus about the best way to do, for
example, cross-chain atomic swaps. It is then implemented.

So please, focus on some BIP(s) detailing applications of hash-locked
transactions, and we will engage more constructively -- I promise that I
will as cross-chain atomic swaps scratch my itch as well.
