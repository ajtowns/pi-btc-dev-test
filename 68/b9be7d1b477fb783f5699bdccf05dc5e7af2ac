Why do you think that? Of course, I would skip the certificate, as its
unnecessary if you see your partner in person.

HTTPS trust is utterly broken unless you fix it by adding the
certificate or a fingerprint to the QR code. Bluetooth is not present in
every case, e.g. QR codes scanned from the web. (Also, we currently
don't have a concept of allowing both. The receiver forces you to either
use BT or HTTP.)

So yes, MITM is what I'm worrying about. When I'm scanning a QR code
from a phone, you don't have that problem (unless sophisticated optical
attacks emerge). Also, the HTTP request can fail and/or be slow, making
the whole payment process more difficult than necessary.
