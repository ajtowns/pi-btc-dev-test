In one way in particular, the transaction fees per kilobyte completely
failed to account for the actual cost to the network.  If Bitcoin had
adopted a common-sense rule like this, I would have had no reason to join
Litecoin development last year.  This is one of the few economic design
flaws that Satoshi overlooked in the original design.

As much as I personally hate the idea of data storage in the blockchain,
this at least discourages the creation of permanent UTXO.
