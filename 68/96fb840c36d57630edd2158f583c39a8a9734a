In the section https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/bip-biprevised/bip-biprevised.mediawiki#formally-defining-consensus

Can we please find another term for the "consensus" here (which is
often confused with "consensus rules", "consensus code" etc)?
In BIP99 I used the term "uncontroversial", but I'm happy to change it
to something else if that helps us moving away from consistently using
the same term for two related but very different concepts.
"nearly universal acceptance", "ecosystem-harmonious"...seriously,
almost anything would be better than keep overloading "consensus"...
