Or, you know, enter some discussions on what exactly are the issues that SPV
clients face during soft forks and see if anything can be done (on all
sides) to mitigate the risks.

Crazy stuff, I know ? ;-)

I agree with Mike Hearn that there is no consensus on using a soft fork to
deploy this feature. Either everyone agrees that we should all agree on
consensus or else there is arbitrary disagreement. You cannot have it both
ways.

It is very important that we reach consensus on consensus or, if you will,
meta0consensus. I think we should Do nothing as that is clearly the choice
that we have taken re: blocksize. If we use one set of rules for that
decision we should use the same set of rules for all decisions and there is
no middle ground.

Thank you.
