Thanks, although I wasn't thinking specifically of you. The fee pull is
pretty well laid out. It just reminded me that it seems to be a common

Yes, I don't know if github supports any kind of SSO. I will investigate.

Perhaps just have a separate section for people who helped review above the
current section? It seems a bit mean not to credit occasional contributors
who fixed bugs or maintained something important but didn't review
complicated changes to the core.
