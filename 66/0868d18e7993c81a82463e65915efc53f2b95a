Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Sidechains: Mainstake
Message-ID: <rRLvSIAs4ZyW4YTai9d_ON_xV2HH6NlhRIsU2C9mzTKiGuXmtJjafTtmK9lJIgBYVNVRGcfKAWON_l2ZE9bKuqON11NXGoKKn1SOGXi8Dbs=@protonmail.com>

Good morning bitcoin-dev,

I have yet another sidechain proposal: https://zmnscpxj.github.io/sidechain/mainstake/index.html

I make the below outlandish claims in the above link:

1. While a 51% mainchain miner theft is still possible, it will take even longer than in drivechains (either months of broadcasting intent to steal before the theft, or locking funds that are likely to remain locked after a week-long theft).
2. A 26% anti-sidechain miner cannot completely block all sidechain withdrawals as they could in drivechains.
3. Outside of attacks and censorship, the economic majority controls sidechains, without going through miners as "representatives of the economic majority".
4. With sufficient cleverness (stupidity?), proof-of-stake can be made to work.

I hope for your consideration.  I suspect that I have not thought things out completely, and probably missed some significant flaw.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
