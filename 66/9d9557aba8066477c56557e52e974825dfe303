Subject: [bitcoin-dev] RFC: HD Bitmessage address derivation based on BIP-43
Message-ID: <CAHabJ+N3Tr5FtStH6Msmj3d8EsvjeTEV6FhSEiizLVs=5ZvCfw@mail.gmail.com>

Monetas has developed a Bitmessage address derivation method from an
HD seed based on BIP-43.


https://github.com/monetas/bips/blob/bitmessage/bip-bm01.mediawiki


We're proposing this as a BIP per the BIP-43 recommendation in order
to reserve a purpose code.
