I don't follow this comment. The BIP aims quite clearly at "SPV" wallets as its justifying scenario.

And they won't get it with BIP151 either. Being a peer is easier than observing the network. If one can observe the encrypted traffic one can certainly use a timing attack to determine what the node has sent.

As will remain the case until all connections are encrypted and authenticated, and all participants are known to be good guys. Starting to sound like PKI?

If we trust the manual links we don't need/want the other links. In fact retaining the other links enables the attack you described above. Of course there is no need to worry about Sybil attacks when all of your peers are authenticated. But again, let us not ignore the problems of requiring all peers on the network be authenticated.

Maybe I was insufficiently explicit. By "relies on identity" I meant that the BIP is not effective without it. I did not mean to imply that the BIP itself implements an identity scheme. I thought this was clear from the context.

Please read more carefully what I wrote. I did not characterize authentication as an identity system. I proposed that key distribution has significant problems, and used identity systems as an example of systems with such problems. I could just have easily written "authentication systems", (and probably should have).

This is the only legitimate scenario that I am aware of. Doing this by IP address (as we do) is weak if there is no VPN.

Yet this scenario is very different than general authentication. This scenario is a set of nodes that is essentially a single logical node from the perspective of the Bitcoin security model. One entity controls the validation rules, or is collaborating with another entity to do so.

My concern is that a general authentication requirement expands this single logical node and gives control over if to the entity that controls key distribution - the hard problem that hasn't been addressed.

If there is no such entity restricting access to the network (which hopefully we can assume) then there is no reason to expect any effective improvement, since nodes will necessarily have to connect with anonymous peers. Anyone with a node and the ability to monitor traffic should remain very effective.

Defining an auth implementation is not a hard problem, nor is it the concern I have raised.
