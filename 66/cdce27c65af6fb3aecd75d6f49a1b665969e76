bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf  It may help you form opinions based in science
rather than what appears to be nothing more than a hunch.  It shows that
even 4MB is unsafe.  SegWit provides up to this limit.

I find this paper wholly unconvincing.  Firstly I note that he assumes the
price of electricity is 10c/kwh in Oct 2015.  As a miner operating and
building large farms at that time, I can guarantee you that almost no large
mines were paying anything even close to that high for electricity, even
then.  If he had performed a detailed search on the big mines he would have
found as much, or could have asked, but it seems like it was simply made
up.  Even U.S. industrial electricity prices are lower than that.

Moreover, he focuses his math almost entirely around mining, asserting in
table 1 that 98% of the "cost of processing a transaction" as being
mining.  That completely misunderstands the purpose of mining.  Miners
occasionally trivially resolve double spend conflicts, but miners are
paid(and played against eachother) for economic security against
attackers.  They aren't paid to process transactions.  Nodes process
transactions and are paid nothing to do so, and their costs are 100x more
relevant to the blocksize debate than a paper about miner costs.  Miner's
operational costs relate to economic protection formulas, not the cost of a
transaction.

He also states: "the top 10% of nodes receive a 1MB block 2.4min earlier
than the bottom 10% ? meaning that depending on their access to nodes, some
miners could obtain a significant and unfair lead over others in solving
hash puzzles."

He's using 2012-era logic of mining.  By October 2015, no miner of any size
was in the bottom 10% of node propagation.  If they were a small or medium
sized miner, they mined shares on a pool and would be at most 30 seconds
behind the pool.  Pools that didn't get blocks within 20 seconds weren't
pools for long.  If they were a huge miner, they ran their own pool with
good propagation times.  For a scientific paper, this is reading like
someone who had absolutely no idea what was really going on in the mining
world at the time.  But again, none of that relates to transaction "costs."
 Transactions cost nodes money; protecting the network costs miners money.
Miners are rewarded with fees; nodes are rewarded only by utility and price
increases.
