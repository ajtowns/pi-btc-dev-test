My preference is height activation + one step per block (i.e. also
height).  Height seems KISS.

AFAICT most of the attacks would occur around the already-heavily-watched
flag day activation event, in a height based environment, a useful
attribute.

However I would like to hear from others about possible attacks with the
various approaches, before diverging from the default community approach of
switch-based-on-time.
