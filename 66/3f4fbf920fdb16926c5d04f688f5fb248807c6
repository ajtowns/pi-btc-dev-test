Sure, most extreme: if secp256k1 or SHA256 starts to show chinks in its armor, or practical quantum computing is getting powerful enough to factor discrete logarithms of those sizes, I don't doubt everyone would go along with a proposal to add new crypto algos.

I do expect there are other possible hardforks that are uncontroversial. Either

- minor issues (maybe solving the time-warp issue with mining) issues planned on the long term
- features that are not politically loaded, on the long term
- major emergencies (anything that is clearly an 'exploit' with regard to coin holders or miners)

Not sure though. The only way to find out is to propose them and see. Maybe wait a bit until things have cooled down...

Note that anything non-critical and non-controversial can be planned and time-locked, say, 5 years ahead, obliviating the need for anyone to quickly upgrade their client.
