You are simplifying too much what I am suggesting

What I am suggesting is: set a derivation method for BIP39 like for 
BIP32 (having the seed for BIP32 and not the derivation path is just 
like having nothing) and use this derivation method from a "book" (a 
"book" being a book, a document, a link, an image, whatever your secret 
can be), based on the fact that you will easily find from this 
derivation method "valid" BIP39 seeds (even if BIP39 does not enforce 
anything regarding valid phrases, everything can be valid as you 
mention, and this does not help in fact)

The derivation method will just define the way you select the words in 
the secret, and if everybody chooses the bible as the secret then this 
will not change the fact that it will be impossible to find the real 
seed without knowing the derivation path

Then you don't need to write the seed, you can easily plausible deny it, 
you can easily pass it to the family (using a passphrase does not say to 
them where they are supposed to use it)

"people lost"--> people think that there is some magic with BIP39 that 
will save them whatever they do (ie they don't even care of managing 
correctly the many easy to generate BIP39 seeds they are using) where 
they will always recover their seed and keys from BIP39/44/49, of course 
this does not work at all
