Subject: [Bitcoin-development] address collision and undependability
Message-ID: <CAKaEYhKQ9vyis3X7PLDgFbYijWck-D_hVnp_xt+muhdzjyXeFQ@mail.gmail.com>

There was a discussion on #bitcon-dev yesterday

I stated that it would be impractical to generate two bitcoin addresses,
such that they differed in exactly one character (modulo different
checksums).

The corollary to this is that if you find an address with a verifiable
signature.  Changing one character of that address would have no known
private key, and hence be normally undependable.

Does that sound correct?
