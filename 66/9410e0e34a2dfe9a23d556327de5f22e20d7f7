Once a feature has been vetted and the code is deployed, miners may signal that they are ready to enforce new rules. If for some reason miners are too "passive or lazy" or wish to "veto" the activation of the new rules, users may choose to circumvent said veto by refusing to accept blocks that do not show readiness for enforcing the new rules.

How does the users show their opinion? They can fork away and leave. But what remains will be united. Are you afraid of the united users or the fork?

I agree with you that the ?vote? is not accurate. Could you kindly suggest an other word for that?

I think users should have choice to follow the miners or not. Do you agree with this or not?

It is not referring to using hashpower to determine the correct chain amongst an infinitely variable number of currently invalid chain forks. Bitcoin ecosystem participants should not have faith in miners (or any other entity) when it comes to choosing the consensus rules they wish to enforce.

Arrrgh. I think in the BIP, the miners just invalids tx version 1 temporarily. That?s a ?soft fork? right? If they dislike the idea, they can leave as always.
