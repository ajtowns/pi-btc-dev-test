IMO privacy its something developers should make sure users have it.
Also, I think, todays SPV wallets should make users more aware of the possible privacy implications.

Do users know, if they pay for a good in a shop while consuming the shops WIFI, that the shop-owner as well as the ISP can use that data to combine it with the user profile (and ~ALL FUTURE purchases you do with the same wallet IN ANY LOCATION online or in-person)?

Do users know, that ISPs (cellular; including Google) can completely link the used Bitcoin wallet (again: all purchase including future ones) with the to the ISP well known user profile including credit-card data and may sell the Bitcoin data to any other data mining company?

If you use BIP37, you basically give your transaction history (_ALL TRANSACTIONS_ including transactions in future) to everyone.

This may be true because they are not aware of the ramification and I don?t think client side filtering is a drop-in replacement for todays, smartphone SPV-model.
