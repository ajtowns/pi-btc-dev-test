Beat me to it. My own implementation is here:
https://github.com/christophebiocca/bitcoin-network-simulator
Same basic principles, but I've been following the protocol message
structure as much as possible/Theoretical support for transaction
propagation (I really want to see zero-conf stuff, and whether it works).
Running a network of 1000 full nodes (with 100 miners) for a week of
simulated time (with a normal hashrate) and empty blocks (except for the
coinbase transaction) takes about 30-60 seconds.
Uses nodejs, with the ultimate goal of having a network/chain visualization
running in the browser (with the actual simulation running on a WebWorker
to keep things responsive).
