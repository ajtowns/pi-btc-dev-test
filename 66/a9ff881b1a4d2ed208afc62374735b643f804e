Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Block Size Increase
Message-ID: <COL402-EAS17EC0834A6CEDDBEEAE5D8CDDE0@phx.gbl>

Replace by fee is what I was referencing.? End-users interpret the old transaction as expired.? Hence the nomenclature.  An alternative is a new feature that operates in the reverse of time lock, expiring a transaction after a specific time.  But time is a bit unreliable in the blockchain

How about creating all transactions with an expiration time starting with a low fee, then replacing with new transactions that have a higher fee as time passes.? Users can pick the fee curve they desire based on the transaction priority they want to advertise to the network.? Users set the priority in the wallet, and the wallet software translates it to a specific fee curve used in the series of expiring transactions.? In this manner, transactions are never left hanging for days, and probably not even for hours.

These could involve hybrid priority/fee selection so low fee transactions see degraded performance instead of failure. This would be the conservative low risk approach.
