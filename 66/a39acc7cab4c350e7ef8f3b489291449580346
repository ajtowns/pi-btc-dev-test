Intriguing; and certainly a change of the normal pace around here.

In these posts I am reminded of and sense some qualitative
similarities with a 2012 proposal by Mr. NASDAQEnema of Bitcointalk
with respect to multigenerational token architectures. In particula,r
your AES ModuleK Hashcodes (especially in light of Winternitz
compression) may constitute an L_2 norm attractor similar to the
motherbase birthpoint metric presented in that prior work.  Rethaw and
I provided a number of points for consideration which may be equally
applicable to your work:

Your invocation of emotive packets suggests that you may be a
colleague of Mr. Virtuli Beatnik?  While not (yet) recognized as a
star developer himself; his eloquent language and his mastery of skb
crypto-calculus and differential-kernel number-ontologies demonstrated
in his latest publication ( https://archive.org/details/EtherealVerses
) makes me think that he'd be an ideal collaborator for your work in
this area.
