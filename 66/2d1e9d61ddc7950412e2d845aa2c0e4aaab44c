Please start with the centralization metrics we both agree are
necessary instead of keeping insulting me publicly and privately.

I'm not inventing this, he recently said so himself publicly on this
mailing list:

"I don't believe that the maximum block size has much at all to do with
mining centralization"

http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/009960.html

It is therefore not surprising that non-developers and developers with
less experience in Bitcoin than Gavin have similar misunderstandings.

That claim seems in contradiction with his earlier analysis:
http://gavinandresen.ninja/are-bigger-blocks-better-for-bigger-miners

"I ran some simulations, and if blocks take 20 seconds to propagate, a
network with a miner that has 30% of the hashing power will get 30.3%
of the blocks."

That's why I was surprised when he denied the relation between the
consensus maximum size and mining centralization, but hey, people
change their minds and that's completely fine. I change my mind about
many things quite often myself. For example, I will change my mind
about not touching the maximum blocksize consensus rule as soon as I
see some data that convinces that the proposed sizes are not very
risky.
