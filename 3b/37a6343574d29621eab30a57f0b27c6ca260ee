Because halving the block interval comes with costs to SPV proofs (which
double the number of headers) and mining centralization (doubles the
selfish mining effect of latency) for the questionable benefit of a block
expectation time that is still measured in minutes, not seconds.

Doubling the block size is safer than halving the block interval, for the
same effect in aggregate transactions per second.
