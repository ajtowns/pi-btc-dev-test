In this case, even mandatory graftroot would not allow the signing stakeholders
to take the coins. The reason is that if there are _any_ non-signing script
conditions that must be followed, then to use Taproot the top-level public key
needs to be unusable, e.g. by being a NUMS point. In that case the public key
would also be unusable for Graftroot.

Another way to see this is -- in any context where Graftroot seems dangerous,
there needs to be a reason why the ability to just create transactions is not
dangerous. In your example it seems that the signing parties can just take
the coins with or without Graftroot, so the problem is not in Graftroot but
in the way that the example is set up.

To do this in Taproot you need to disable the top-level key, which will also
disable Graftroot.
