FWIW, at least MtGox was OK with the plan to move to non-blockchain-spam
0-confirmation via an extra signature. Why do you ignore this possibility, and 
merge stuff that will break it? Do you have an alternative solution to the 
problem of green addresses spamming the blockchain? As I noted in the pull 
request, stripping extra data has no negative impact on normal transactions, 
and clients creating these can be written to expect the txnid to change (or 
simply not care what the txnid is).
