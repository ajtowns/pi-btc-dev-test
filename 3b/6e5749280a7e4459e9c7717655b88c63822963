My post provided a concrete example. I'd be happy to answer any
questions about it, but otherwise I'm not sure how to make it more
clear.

Quite the opposite-- a large block cipher is a standard
construction... and the off-label application of a KDF that you've
used here doesn't provide any protection against the example I gave.
