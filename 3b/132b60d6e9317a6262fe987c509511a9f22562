"If you have database problems are you perhaps switching between 0.8.x and
0.9.x with the same directory?"
I think that may have been the issue.

Maybe now that I have a 0.9.0 official binary, when I switch to the source
builds I won't have the issue.

However, I think I'll do what you do and have separate bitcoin data
directories, that's probably the best.

not trying to test anything specifically, just codign, building, launching
over and over, would like to make the startup of the Qt client faster.
