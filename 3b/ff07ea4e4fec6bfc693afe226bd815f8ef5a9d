This 50% chance assumption is wrong; it's almost 0% for a low enough
fee.  Thus the cost is only 18576, making the cost for the transactions
463x lower than just sending 1sat/vbyte txs under optimal conditions.
That's a bit ouch.[1]

I think a better solution is to address the DoS potential directly:
if a replacement doesn't meet #3 or #4, but *does* increase the feerate
by at least minrelayfee, processing should be delayed by 30-60 seconds.

That means that eventually you will RBF a larger tx, but it'll take
much longer.  Should be easy to implement, too, since similar timers
will be needed for dandelion.

Cheers,
Rusty.
[1] Christian grabbed some more detailed propagation stats for me: larger
    txs do propagate slower, but only by a factor of 2.5 or so.
