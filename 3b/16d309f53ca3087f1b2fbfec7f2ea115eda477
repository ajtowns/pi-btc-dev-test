That's exactly what i said above, in a more euphemistic fashion :D

indeed.

i'm sure that with the list being unused, we could change the charter
and do whatever with it, and the people who matter probably won't object.

Indeed, good points on all counts.

good points. re 1), i'm pretty sure that -dev is the most active
bitcoin-related public mailing list. things may have changed in the past
half-year, but it seems unlikely.

charter can be changed if needed. creator/maintainer, that being me, is
generally known to be a pretty decent guy :). i'm not attached to this
particular list though, but whatever happens, i'd hope that there will
be more people willing to share administrative duties. not sure if
googlegroups is the best interface, if we can find some good free host
with mailman, downloadable archives, the works, that may be preferable.
i started that group on gg simply because it was free and easily
available and easy to set up.
