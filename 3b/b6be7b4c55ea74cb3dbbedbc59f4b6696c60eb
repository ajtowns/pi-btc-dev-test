One more thing to add. The implementation in the reference patch fixes
the blockchain forking issue however by still allowing spent coinbases
to be disconnected patched clients are still vulnerable to blockchain
corruption. While not an immediate issue it would mean
LoadBlockIndex() would error on restart and could cause problems for
new clients during the initial blockchain download.

Is there a reason not to disallow duplicate coinbases entirely?
