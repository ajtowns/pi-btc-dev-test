Because this is such a common sentiment, I wrote a couple of articles on
the matter.

The first is about why BIP 70 uses the SSL PKI and an examination of the
most commonly proposed alternative ideas:

... including the web of trust, using bitcoin addresses/the block chain,
allowing multiple certs, trust-on-first-use and (for SSL only)
perspectives/convergence.

The second is a summary of some of the most famous crypto-usability
research papers published in the past 10-15 years. They cover SSL and PGP.
If you're interested in designing alternatives, reading these papers would
be a good place to start:

There's a book from O'Reilly called Security & Usability that contains 34
papers and essays. It's very good:
