This is why my motivation is rather secure backup, not multisig. Instead of storing encrypted seed in one location and the passphrase for it in an other location, one can just store two shares in two places.


> Right - the explanation in the BIP about the board of  directors is IMO a little misleading. The problem is with splitting a private key is that at some point, someone has to get the full private key back and they can then just remember the private key to undo the system. CHECKMULTISIG avoids this.

In particular, when do you see that it would be superior to simply going with multisig in the first place? Perhaps you see these as complimentary approaches, toward defense-in-depth? In any case, the Motivation and Rationale sections of the BIP in its current form are silent on these questions.
