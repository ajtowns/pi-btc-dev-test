If alias resolution was guaranteed to always be just the address, then 
yes, I would opt for no serialization at all. A simple plain text 
response of an address is about as simple as it can get.

There are already a lot of good ideas floating around about how the 
alias protocol could be extended. Is it really going to stay that simple 
for long? I would personally much just have a serialized response 
upfront, rather than having to worry about backward compatibility in the 
future.
