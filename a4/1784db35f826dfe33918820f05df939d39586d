Hi ZmnSCPxj,

Just to clarify, my design does not specify the source of voting power, so
it is agnostic to whatever system you want to derive stake or valdiator set
membership from.

Your idea of timelocking Bitcoin is interesting, I am eager to find a
solution where holding Bitcoin is enough to get voting power. It's possible
there may be an issue with the fact that the Bitcoin is not slashable
(although their voting power is), meaning a validator who double-signs
cannot have their Bitcoin removed from them. However their UTXO can be
blacklisted which does make their attack costly since they lose out on the
time-value of their stake.

Our current thinking for the source of stake is to pay out stake to Bitcoin
merged-miners although I'll definitely do some more thinking about
timelocked Bitcoin as stake.
