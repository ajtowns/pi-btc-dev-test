I think we'll want a bitcoin address in there for a long time for
backwards compatibility.

If web browser support for arbitrary MIME types is strong enough (I
haven't tested), then a payment request can be initiated with just an
anchor tag:
  <a href="https://merchant.com/pay.php?3D2a8628fc2fbe"
type="application/bitcoin-paymentrequest">

Doing it that way saves a http round-trip.
