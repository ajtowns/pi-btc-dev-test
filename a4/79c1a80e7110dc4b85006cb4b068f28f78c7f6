It sounds more efficient but it is not clear to me that it would change 
the level of centralization of how the final decisions are made.

One threat to Bintcoin involves incentive for companies to hire 
developers.  The only reason is to change (or not change) Bitcoin Core 
so it is beneficial to their interests.  I am not sure anything can be 
done about that risk but it needs to be understood and considered and 
not just ignored.

I assume that would mean fees that hike transaction fees and make 
Bitcoin more expensive?
