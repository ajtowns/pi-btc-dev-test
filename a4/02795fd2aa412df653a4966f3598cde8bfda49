This mailing list was never meant to be a place "to hold the bitcoin
development community accountable for its actions [sic]." I know other
developers that have switched to digest-only or unsubscribed. I know if
this became a channel for PR and populist venting as you describe, I would
leave as well. This mailing list is meant to be a place to discuss ongoing
bitcoin development issues relating to the protocol and its instantiation
in bitcoin core. Please don't decrease the utility of this list by
expanding scope.
