Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Miners are struggling with blocks far smaller
 than 750KB blocks and resorting to SPV mining

The traffic between the pool server and individual hashers is far busier 
than 50kB/30s. If their bandwidth is so limited, hashers would have 
switched to other pools already.

All these data may prove is they have very bad mining codes. For 
example, their hashers may not be required to update the transaction 
list regularly. I don't think they are struggling. They are just too 
lazy or think that's too risky to improve their code. After all, they 
are generating half million USD per day and a few seconds of downtime 
would hurt.

By the way, vast majority of the full blocks (>0.99MB) on the blockchain 
are generated by Chinese pools.
