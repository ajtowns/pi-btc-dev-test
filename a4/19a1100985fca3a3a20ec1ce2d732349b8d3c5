Theoretically, if the recipient address had already disclosed the
public key (i.e. already spent from that address), or shared it with
you instead of (or alongside with) the address, then you can use
recipient's ECDSA key to encrypt the message with ECC, as both ECDSA
and ECC share the same kind of public/private key pair, according to
the this link: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/14662/using-ecdsa-keys-for-encryption

In practice, I am not sure the nodes would broadcast such non-standard
transaction (but it can be mined, nonetheless).
