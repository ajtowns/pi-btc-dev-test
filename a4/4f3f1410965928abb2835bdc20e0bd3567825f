Economic Change Event risk.

Unless the community is going to always avoid this "economic change event"
forever (effectively eliminating MAX_BLOCK_SIZE), this is going to happen
at some point. I assume those concerned with the "economic change" are only
scared about it because "nitcoin is still very young" of something like
that.
Since you advocate for delaying this event from happening, can you be
clearer about when do you think it would be ok to let the event happen?
What other event makes this event ok?

actors to a notable degree.  Maintaining a short term economic policy of
fixed 1M supply in the face of rising transaction volume carries risks that
should be analyzed and communicated.

Assuming we adopt bip102, eventually you will be able to say exactly the
same about 2 MB. When does this "let's not change the economics" finishes
(if ever)?
