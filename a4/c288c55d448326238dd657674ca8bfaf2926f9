Melvin,

This is certainly a similar concept. It is a software for creating markets
with variable levels of privacy and censorship resistance. It is built
directly on top of Bitcoin Core and Bitmessage.

I believe this project to be in the spirit of Satoshi's original plan for
a bitcoin marketplace but it is not the same project, and I certainly am
not Satoshi. :)
