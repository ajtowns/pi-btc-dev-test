This is true but confuses people because obviously miners must commit capital to mining before any block space can exist to have value. The reason for the misunderstanding is that miners don?t simply respond, they anticipate. All production, and therefore capital investment, is the result of anticipation of future returns, not an attempt to chase past returns.

The first miner anticipated that the then-worthless ?tokens? he was mining would have a future value. Turns out he was right. Others have been wrong, which is the nature of betting on future prices. But if nobody does it, there are no products.
