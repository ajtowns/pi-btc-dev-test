Agreed.  There are two cases to consider:

Type 1.  One implementation says ?yes? or ?no,? while the other says ?I don?t know?, and

Type 2.  One implementation says ?yes? and the other says ?no,? because of a bug.  

My previous email described how Type 1 consensus failures can be safely dealt with.  These include many kinds of database exceptions (e.g., the LevelDB fork at block #225,430), or consensus mismatches regarding the max size of a block.  

Type 2 consensus failures are more severe but also less likely (I?m not aware of a Type 2 consensus failure besides the 92 million bitcoin bug from August 2010).  If Core was to accept a rogue TX that created another 92 million bitcoins, I think it would be a good thing if the other implementations forked away from it (we don?t want bug-for-bug compatibility here).   

This once again reveals the benefits of multiple competing implementations.  

Sincerely,
Peter
