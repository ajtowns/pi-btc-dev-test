Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Suggestion: Dynamic block size that updates
	like difficulty
Message-ID: <BEB3AF9B-35D2-4742-8C61-A738F49C0EC1@gmail.com>

Why can't we have dynamic block size limit that changes with difficulty, such as the block size cannot exceed 2x the mean size of the prior difficulty period? 

I recently subscribed to this list so my apologies if this has been addressed already.
