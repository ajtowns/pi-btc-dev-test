Introducing a bunch of clever ECDSA math doesn't change the fact that
the clever math isn't what is preventing double-spending, clever
economics is. Just like Bitcoin itself.

No sense getting people potentially confused by a bunch of complex
equations that aren't relevant to the more fundemental and much more
important principle that math alone can't prevent double-spending.
