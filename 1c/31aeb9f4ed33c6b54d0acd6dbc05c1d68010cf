Thanks but you did not answer all the points and some of your statements
look wrong, like the global ideas behind this proposal from my
standpoint, which basically is inventing strange things not reusing what
is already proven to be working well and could provide the same result,
which at the end is not the expected one, ie increasing full nodes, it
sounds like a strange workaround to prevent the centralization of the
blockchain when pruning will become the default

To answer some other comments in this thread, giving an incentive to run
full nodes does not mean that someone setting up tomorrow 10K nodes will
become rich and/or will be able to control the network, the later being
not unlikely at all to happen in the current situation, the idea is more
to motivate people that already have the resources to run full nodes,
then we mix the concepts of optimizing the resources at no additional
costs (and even decreasing costs since you get rewarded for the part
that you have already paid but don't use) with the one of running nodes
to protect its business

For example
https://gist.github.com/Ayms/aab6f8e08fef0792ab3448f542a826bf#proposal
is showing some concepts where nodes can't position themselves where
they like and are registered in the system by the others (but forget the
proof of something as written in this gist since I think the rewards
should not depend on usual miners) , so it becomes quite difficult that
they position themselves where they like to possibly get the rewards,
fake the system, freeride, cheat, collude in pools or setup plenty of nodes

Yes, that's the easy part, the issue is more for the network to check
that users have sufficient bandwidth and don't cheat

Of course

Then please explain how you would attack the bittorrent DHT and why it's
"much easier" than attacking the btc network today, bittorrent is not
designed for security/privacy, including its DHT, which btw is great,
it's a common sign of misinformation to conclude that all DHTs are
necessarily insecure

The btc network can't be considered as a p2p network in its current form
then can't be the best one for now (and if it was then we would not be
in today's situation)

This is another problem of your proposal, as well as
fingerprinting/tracking peers based on what they have

Are you suggesting that the btc "p2p" network should be using the Tor
network, and especially the nodes hosting the/(a part of) the
blockchain? This is of course a very bad idea and you would not
eliminate the tracking issue, a simple example is that despite ot the
size of the network it's not difficult to track the peers on the
bittorrent network, you might not know who is the peer but you can
follow whatever he is doing, and hidding behind Tor or a VPN does not
prevent this

If you really know the Tor network, then you know why encouraging home
users to run full nodes is probably not a good idea

"Probably" because the situation is not the same for btc and indeed UASF
for example is referring to "users" who today are not really "users" but
intermediate nodes, so the decision finally is not made by the users

This is just delaying the problem, you are just proposing to store some
parts of the blockchain not explaining how the peers will first setup
the nodes, some parts that will of course increase... then falling back
in the issue that you are trying to address

You are reinventing something that would be achieved easily using the
concepts of torrents or incremental ones (ie someone would seed the
whole thing, some others some parts of it, etc)

What I meant is that you can't build a hierarchy of btc nodes: big
nodes, medium nodes, small nodes, each node is free to decide how/if it
participates to the network, so the wording of "archival" nodes for me
is not adapted since it makes immediately think to centralized entities,
big organizations hosting the blockchain, etc

This is the usual answer but I don't believe it, people will rely on
others to run full nodes and secure them, and so on...

I did noy read them again, some others are listed in the link above

Again, you don't explain how you bootstrap the full nodes first, which
is the main issue, and if the idea is that the pruning nodes will never
desync then you should try downloading x GB to resync connecting to 5/8
peers possibly operating from home in different countries
