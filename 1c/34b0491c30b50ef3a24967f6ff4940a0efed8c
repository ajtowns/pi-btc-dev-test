Can you send me the actual raw transaction (that site doesn't appear
have a way to get it, only some cooked json output; which doesn't
include the sequence number).

As I said, it's a severe bug if unlocked transactions are being
relayed or mempooled far in advance.

Ah I missed that the replacement had to be final. Thats indeed a much
more sane thing to do than I was thinking (sorry for some reason I saw
the +1 and thought it was just checking the sequence number was
higher.)

If they can relay the first one to begin with its an an issue, the
replacement just makes it twice an issue. :)
