If luke-jr thinks I should submit CMF as a BIP, I can certainly do that.
Luke, what do you think?

I don't have a preference either way.

I'm sorry, I'm not following you here. Is there a question?

I am not very well versed in mediawiki tables, and I found github has some 
incompatibilities too.
The markdown one looks better;

I have to disagree. That is not malleability. Creating a new document and re-
signing it is not changing anything. Its re-creating. Something that the owner 
of the coin has every right to do.

Sorry, what is evident? You seem to imply that it is uncommon that you can 
create two transactions of similar intent but using different bytes.
You would be wrong with this implication as this is very common. You can just 
alter the order of the inputs, for instance.

I am unable to see what the point is you are trying to make. Is there a 
question or a suggestion for improvement here?

Maybe you missed this line; 
  ?TxInPrevHash and TxInPrevIndex
   Index can be skipped, but in any input the PrevHash always has
   to come first?

If you still see something alarming, let me know.
You can look at the code in Bitcoin Classic and notice that it really isn't 
anything complicated or worrying.

Hmm, it looks like you are mixing terminology and abstraction-levels.  OP_NOP 
is a field from script and there is no discussion about any rejection based on 
script in this BIP at all.

Rejection of transactions is done on there being unrecognised tokens in the 
transaction formatting itself.

Thank you for your email to my BIP, I hope you got the answers you were 
looking for :)
