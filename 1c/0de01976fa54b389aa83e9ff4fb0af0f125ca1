Indeed, someone could do this if they're interested in it, in their own
fork. That's what I said too. But it's no longer our issue.

With the "main project" here I mean the issue list of bitcoin/bitcoin
project on github, which only deals with that project (and not that of the
forks, which have their own issue lists). You can argue the "main"-ness but
it's just a mailing list message and not some official document deciding
about the future of bitcoin, so I did not feel like specifying it to that
level of detail.
