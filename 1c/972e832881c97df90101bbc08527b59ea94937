Something tells me this would be reduced to a single syllable in common usage I.e. bit.

My 2 cents goes for "bit". 

Because: Bitcoin is a digital currency, BTC starts with "bit", "bit" refers to a small amount of something in its regular english usage and lastly 99.9876543% of people on the planet don't know what a digital "bit" is yet ...
