In general, new consensus rules are not trivial to implement. Block size limits are exceptional in being so simple to change in the code. So what you?re proposing sounds more like a plugin model supporting dynamic linking than a configuration file.

The real problem isn?t so much the difficulty of creating forks of the codebase - but the fact that unless a fork has overwhelming support, blockchains cannot guarantee irreversibility of transactions?which defeats their entire purpose.
