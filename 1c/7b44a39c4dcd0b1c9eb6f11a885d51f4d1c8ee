This is not just "a political issue". The internet as we know it is at
stake, and bitcoin depends directly on a working, single, globally
connected internet (at least for now, until mesh networking goes
anywhere...).

*Everyone* using bitcoin has the interest in keeping the internet working
and un-balkanized. That's not a political opinion, it's a fact.

The laws could also criminalize both the users and developers, if they
regard bitcoin as a "payment network". And countries aren't too fussy about
extradition to the US (see the case of Richard O'Dwyer).

Though I agree that SOPA and PIPA are just manifestations of a brand of
censorship that is spreading all over the world. Stopping these laws won't
solve the underlying issue either. Other countries will keep pushing for
them, and we can't blank out the page for every country.

However, that does not make the issue "political and thus meaningless".
Also: "being too small to matter" is never a good argument to not do
something. It is fear paralysis.
