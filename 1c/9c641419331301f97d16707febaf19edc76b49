Right, but as I said, I think this is likely to become a contest of who
can create the lowest latency mining operation, or to be more precise,
who can get the best ratio of latency per dollar.

Unfortunately even with totally "honest" mining winning orphan rates is
a function of latency; what this paper has done is mainly show a
remarkably effective way of leveraging low-latency and very good
visibility to the network.

Regardless, globe-spanning low-latency networks cost a lot of money, so
if they are something that makes mining more profitable, for whatever
reason, that's an effect that will incentivise pools to grow larger and
more centralized.

Yeah, there's a lot of possible solutions, but what I'm seeing looking
at them is they all tend to be not economically rational, in the short
term, or even worse, they actually incentivize mining pools to get
larger. For instance anything that tries to prevent Alice from sybiling
the network by forcing nodes to prove they have mining capacity just
means that larger miners will have an advantage over smaller ones in
getting their blocks propagated as fast as possible. Once Alice does
have a reasonable amount of mining capacity, she can still use the
selfish miner attack to grow larger and more profitable.
