There is also the benefit that if someone screws up BTC and uBTC, it's
likely to fail.  Most people don't have 1e6 times as much money in their
wallet as they attempted to send in a single transaction.  Similarly,
sending one-millionth of what you meant to is likely invalid or below
the dust limit. 

Well it looks like the consensus is to do it, instead of talking about
it.  I'm going to make sure we get uBTC into the next Armory release.
