This is just a guess, but I can imagine sipa's address index branch
might be more suitable for an use case where information about any
address is required - jmcorgan continued to maintain a usually somewhat
up-to-date version:

https://github.com/jmcorgan/bitcoin/tree/addrindex

As for balance queries, that's not possible out of the box and I have my
own branch for this with a few other RPC calls that are noted in the README:

https://github.com/dexX7/bitcoin/tree/master-addrindex-extended

When using the original, you need to ensure a transaction is part of the
main chain and wasn't orphaned. If you consider using my branch, please
consider it twice and review the changes first.
