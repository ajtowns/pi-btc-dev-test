That orphan rate increase will go to whoever is producing the 20MB blocks,
NOT you.

Are you sure that is the best strategy? If a big block is slow to
propagate, I suspect it will be better to punish the miner that created it
by refusing to build on it until it has been fully validated.

I'll try to find time to run a couple of simulations.

I can benchmark it. It should be pretty fast, and sipa has a couple of
patches pending to make the UTXO cache much faster.

It can be fast because the vast majority of the work of validating all
those transactions can happen as they are received into the memory pool.

You should be able to handle 20MB blocks no problem; if I round up to 100MB
per block that works out to 1.3Mbps.

That speed will handle 20MB blocks no problem.

If each 20MB block is 100MB of data up/down the wire (I'm vastly
over-estimating, after optimization it should be 40MB) then you'll be
paying...uhhh:

0.1 GB / block-data-on-wire * 144 blocks/day * 30.5 days/month * 0.13 $ /
GB = $57

Less than $2 per day in bandwidth.

That's OK, you'll 1.3Mbps or less.

Are you worried about paying too much, or do 20MB blocks "feel like too
much" ?
