Cartesian product can mean a lot of things.

What specifically do you mean by "cartesian product" here?


Oops, I forgot to reply all.  Below is my reply.

Given two types A and B, then A ? B is the type of pairs of A and B in the
sense of type theory as used in Standard ML or Haskell or other typed
languages.


To follow up, by "sha256Compress : Word256 ? Word512 -> Word256" I mean
that sha256Compress is a function that takes two arguments, the first being
a 256 bit word and the second being a 512 bit word, and returns a 256 bit
word (or equivalently sha256Compress is a function that takes a pair as
input, the first component being a 256 bit word and the second component
being a 512 bit word, and returns a 256 bit word).

sha256Compress is meant to be the compression function defined by the
SHA256 standard, though nothing here depends on anything more that its type
signature.
