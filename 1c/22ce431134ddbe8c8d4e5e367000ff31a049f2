Sure, and I share your view - I want to know what is happening in the
Bitcoin development space when I scan this email account.

Unfortunately, one moral imbecile keeps polluting this space.

I am confident that I have the debating resources and mental savvy to
show this individual to be an intellectual lightweight and a bankrupt
speaker that should shut his mouth, for good, in this list.

I'm not sure where your own allegiances lie, but if you think XT is a
bright idea, you can go there and participate to your heart's content.
In the meantime, this is a Bitcoin Core developer list and
self-proclaimed enemies of Core should not post here or pretend to
have consensus-blocking powers, as O'Hearn keeps capitulating.

Let me put this aspiring lord in his place and then we talk again. I
will knock him down in round 1 and knock him out in round 3. If you
love this man, go to xt-dev list and enjoy and spend your coins in
that alternate chain.
