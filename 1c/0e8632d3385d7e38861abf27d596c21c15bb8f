You seem to have jumped off the topic; you mentioned that there were 
thousands of RFCs that we should review over why we shouldn't use a URI; and 
you've pointed at an RFC that shows how a URI can be used.

While you're right that CGI and HTTP aren't magic; they are commonplace; and 
it's important when we want an infinitely expandable mapping system that 
people can use technology they are already familiar with. People already 
have web servers, people already understand URIs.  It's not "just what we 
are used to"; people who can cope with development of the bitcoin protocol 
aren't going to be worried about protocol complexity.  It is a concern about 
what the rest of the world will have to do to get a bitcoin alias.

No it doesn't address usability at all, because it falls down on the first 
attempt: what if I want to supply a URI that allows my web service to link 
an invoice number to an issued bitcoin address?  You've forced every mapping 
service to be identical, and limited.

You've been unfair, the equivalent of your "user at authority.tld" is 
"https://authority.tld/user" or "https://user.authority.tld/" or 
"https://google.com/bitcoin/user" or any of an infinite number of other 
variations that _I_ as the mapper get to choose rather than whoever wrote 
the BIP; all of which are arguably no less "elegant" than that simple email.

There is no equivalent in the other direction though.  For someone who 
want's to supply the TX to their mapping server... where does it go in 
"user at authority.tld"?
