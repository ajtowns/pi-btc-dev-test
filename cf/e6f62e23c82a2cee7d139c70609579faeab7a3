Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Presenting a BIP for Shamir's Secret Sharing
	of Bitcoin private keys
Message-ID: <1878927.J1e3zZmtIP@crushinator>

Abstract: A method is described for dividing a Bitcoin private key into shares in a manner such that the key can be reconstituted from any sufficiently large subset of the shares but such that individually the shares do not reveal any information about the key. This method is commonly known as Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. Additionally, an encoding methodology is proposed to standardize transmission and storage of shares.

I am looking to have this BIP assigned a number and added to the bitcoin/bips repository. I invite any comments, questions, or suggestions.
