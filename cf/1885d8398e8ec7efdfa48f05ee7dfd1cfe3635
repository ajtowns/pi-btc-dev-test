I agree, I believe the first name that an op with equivalent functionality
had was simply op_maturity.
At least I remember we discussed such an opcode when discussing pegged
sidechains' design.

I kind of dislike the check_x_verify naming pattern. We want all new
operands to return if whatever they're checking/verifying fails, fine. Do
we have to repeat this redundant naming pattern forever due to that
discovery?
I hope not, but if that's the case my vote is for CMV.
As said before, I believe the documentation and code comments can become
much more clear with this change.
