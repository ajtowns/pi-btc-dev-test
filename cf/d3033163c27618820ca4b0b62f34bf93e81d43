I've got a bitcoin-only exit running myself and right now there is absolutely no traffic leaving it. If the traffic coming from that node was legit I'd expect some to be exiting my node too.

Multiple people have confirmed the node is connected to an abnormally large % of the Bitcoin network. Looks like a Sybil attack to me, trying to hide behind a Tor exit node for plausible deniability.
