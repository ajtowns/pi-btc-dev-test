Right. The Status doesn't depend on whether it is a good idea or not, only 
whether or not people are de facto using it.

BIP 2's BIP Comments would have provided a place for Thomas and yourself to 
criticise the BIP, but unfortunately this was too controversial.

BIP 43 merely advises other BIPs how they might do things, so it goes into the 
Draft->Active Status flow rather than Draft->Accepted->Final.
