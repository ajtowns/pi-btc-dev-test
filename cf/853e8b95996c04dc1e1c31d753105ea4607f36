That seems fair.

In general, people are actively bloating the UTXO set with unspendable
outputs (that cannot be 100% proven unspendable).  Provably
unspendable seems like an improvement on long term UTXO health.

It is a fair criticism that this inches the incentives, a bit, towards
timestamping and other non-currency uses.  But those uses (a) cannot
be prevented and (b) have already been automated anyway (e.g. the
python upload/download tools stored in-chain).

I do think the overwhelming majority of users are invested in
bitcoin-the-currency (or bitcoin-the-commodity, take your pick), i.e.
the value proposition.  That's our 98% use case.  Given the relative
volumes of traffic, timestamping/data storage/messaging is essentially
getting a free ride.  So IMO it is worth continuing to explore
/disincentives/ for use of the blockchain for data storage and
messaging, for the rare times where a clear currency-or-data-storage
incentive is available.
