I think you've misunderstood what TXO commitments are. From my article:

"A merkle tree committing to the state of all transaction outputs, both spent
and unspent, can provide a method of compactly proving the current state of an
output."
-https://petertodd.org/2016/delayed-txo-commitments#txo-commitments:

I'm proposing that we commit to not just the set of transaction outputs, but
also the current *state* of those outputs, with the same commitment structure.

Concretely, each leaf node in the TXO commitment tree needs to commit to - at
minimum - the outpoint (txid:n) and spent/unspent status (possibly structurally
as mentioned elsewhere in this thread). It's probably also valuable to commit
to the scriptPubKey, nValue, as well, though technically that's redundant as
the txid already commits to that (there's some implementation options here).

Why would you commit to a balanced version of the TXO set? I'm proposing
committing to an insertion-ordered list, indexed by txout #.

Hmm? That's exactly what I'm doing. Also, as per the above, I think you've
misunderstood what my TXO commitment proposal is.
