You could do that today, with one of the 3 interoperable Lightning implementations available. Lowering the block interval on the other hand comes with a large number of centralizing downsides documented elsewhere. And getting down to 1sec or less on a global network is simply impossible due to the speed of light. 

If you want point of sale support, I suggest looking into the excellent work the Lightning teams have done.
