This is probably going to sound impolite, but I think it's pertinent.

Gavin, on dwelling on the the fact that you appear to not understand
the basics of the lightning network, I am a little alarmed about this,
given your recent proposals to unilaterally push the network into
quite dangerous areas of game theory, to lobby companies etc.

People are super polite and respectful around here, but this is not
looking good, if you don't mind me saying so.  You can't make balanced
or informed trade-offs on block-size schedules stretching into the
future, if you don't understand work that is underway, and has been
for months.  Lightning is a major candidate approach the rest of the
technical community sees for Bitcoin to scale.

Lightning allows Bitcoin to scale even without a block-size increase,
and therefore considerably impacts any calculation of how much
block-size is required.  In this light you appear to have been
attempting to push through a change without even understanding the
alternatives or greater ecosystem.
