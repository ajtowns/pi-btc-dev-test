It is as you say a trivial exploit, which means it will happen when the economic incentive is great enough. Analogous attacks on other points of centralization are already well underway.

What on first sight seems trivial may be totally different when looking
deeper. People here seem to not realise that a lot of data centers (the
IAAS ones) just are just grouping the computers and provide remote
access. The client have full control over the machines. The center thus
just provides the hardware, the power and the internet access. They
typically don't inspect your internet traffic only reduce the speed if
you are going above certain threshold. Additionally there are countries
like Iceland that specifically make laws to not let the government get
power over data and network traffic in data centers.
Domestic ISP services typically want to prioritize traffic and thus have
most of the time network traffic deep packet inspection (DPI)
capabilities. These are thus much easier forced by government to filter
certain traffic. Additionally these companies often fall under
telecommunication laws also given government more control over them than
in a typical data center.

I host my Bitcoin node in a German datacenter and am sure it is more
censorship resistant that a node going through any American ISP.

Staf.
