As noted to Adam last night - although I agree it adds complexity - side
chains are one solution that will indeed help with scaling long term.
Similar to the graph you see with git repos and merges, having aggregation
chains that arbitrarily fork and then rejoin the main chain are both
feasible and useful.

That code & future is a ways away from production, so doesn't help us
here.  Still, let's not dismiss it as a solution either.
