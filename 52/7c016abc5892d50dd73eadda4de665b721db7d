Read my proposal for "Partial UTXO" mode:

Actually the really scary thing about partial UTXO mode is miners can
get away without keeping the entire chain provided they don't (often)
try to mine transactions spending UTXO's that they haven't verified
themselves.

They can get away with accepting blocks without checking that the UTXO's
exist, at least until enough miners do so that someone creates an
invalid block and the majority of hashing power never notices. Remember
that only with a complete UTXO set can you know that a UTXO *doesn't*
exist.

We're going to have to force miners to prove they possess the full UTXO
set in the future or the security of Bitcoin will be seriously
threatened.

How do you know they actually are someone else?

Do you think you have SPV or full security in that situation?

Do you know the difference?
