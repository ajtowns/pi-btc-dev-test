Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Regtest Address Version Change Proposal
Message-ID: <CAEz79Prrpwi6SXyCpGesmkdau6vjtwELAhr6quXtFZ6_t1-y2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I propose changing all of the address versions in -regtest mode to be
unique so they are no longer identical to testnet.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_address_prefixes
For example, regtest pubkey hash addresses could begin with r or R.

We need to know if any existing tools would need to be modified to support
this change to regtest.  Do existing tools outside of pull tester expect
regtest to have testnet addresses?  If the quantity of tools that currently
handle regtest is small then we can modify them to the new address versions.
