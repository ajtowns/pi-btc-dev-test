Myself I would trust neither the hardware wallet nor my computer...

So looks like the first version of the TREZOR won't support multisig -
how far away are we from support? What about other manufacturers?

P2SH support is probably going to be a major sticking point. The payment
protocol is all well and good, but it doesn't (yet) help getting money
to the individual. bitcoinj P2SH support for sending would be a major
help here - lots of person-to-person trades happen via Android wallets.
