If you have the the full extended secret there then you can spend
along the chain? but just the plain ecdsa secret by itself is not
enough to spend anything but that address itself.

Or have I misunderstood you here?

Sadly that construction has no ability to separate address generation
from spending? an important element for merchant applications.  Not
just for their own own distinguishing of transactions but because the
use of fresh addresses is essential to the limited privacy properties
of the Bitcoin system.

I called that a type-1 deterministic wallet in some old forum post
where I wrote about the different derivation schemes as opposed to the
point combining type-2 construction. The hope in BIP32 was that we
could get away just using a single one.
