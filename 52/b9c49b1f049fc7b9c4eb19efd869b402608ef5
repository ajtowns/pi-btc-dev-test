Also, it's important to take note of the motivation behind not banning
duplicate tx hashes outright. Doing so would require that spent tx
hashes are retained forever. A pruning node will have no way of knowing
whether a new tx duplicates the hash of a preceding tx. Any
implementation that does retain such hashes and dismisses new txs on
that basis would fork against pruning nodes.
