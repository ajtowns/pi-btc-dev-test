If I understand the situation, bitcoind does work but not bitcoin-qt due to
qt-4.6?  If that is so, then the official Bitcoin 0.8.6 binaries didn't
work on Squeeze either this is not a regression.

The priority is for bitcoind to work on as many distributions as reasonably
possible as older stable distributions are most often headless.  If you are
a rare user who needs Bitcoin-Qt on an incompatible system you can at least
build it from source.
