It is certainly true that standardness is an artificial construct that 
only has meaning to this particular implementation of the software, but 
no meaning in the context of the protocol or the system as a whole.

On the other hand, the vast, vast majority of all transactions follow a 
particular pattern.  If someone gives you one that doesn't match the 
standard pattern, you might be a little suspicious, but it is no big 
deal.  But, if they emit dozens or hundreds, it is hardly unreasonable 
to disconnect them until you figure out what's going on.
