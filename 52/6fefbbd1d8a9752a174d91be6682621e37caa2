I think this is a very interesting idea. As Bitcoiners, we often stuff
things into the 'alt chain' bucket in our heads; I wonder if this idea
works better as a curing period, essentially an extended version of the
current 100 block wait for mined coins.

An alternate setup comes to mind; I can imagine this working as a sort of
gift economy; people pay real BTC for merge-mined "beta BTC" as a way to
support development. There is no doubt a more elegant and practical
solution that might have different economic and crypto characteristics.
