So, conceptually, another way to deal with this is to hardcode a blockhash
where we allow blocks in a chain ending with that blockhash to _not_ follow
BIP65, up until that blockhash, and any blockchain without that blockhash must
respect BIP65 for all blocks in the chain.

This is a softfork: we've only added rules that made otherwise valid chains
invalid, and at the same time we are still accepting large reorgs (albeit under
stricter rules than before).

I'd suggest we call this a exemption hash - we've exempted a particular
blockchains from a soft-forked rule that we would otherwise enforce.
