I have the same opinion.

On the other hand, I can imagine using compression on local blocks storage (be it compressed filesystem, or compression in the user space/in the application - compare with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2278). Now that we support pruning and obfuscating, this could be another option. Saving ~20% can be interesting in some usecases.
