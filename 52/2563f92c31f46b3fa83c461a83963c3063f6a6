Personally I like the simplicity of tapping two phones together to
make payment - it should be quicker and easier than scanning QR codes
and it's a trust model that's hard to misunderstand.

Is NFC good enough for that?  I fear even with NFC it is possible to
produce a device with longer range than one would expect.  What
happened to the idea of tapping two devices together and then
comparing the timing of the tap (as detected by the phones'
accelerometers) to make spoofing a transaction harder?  I remember
hearing about that years ago - is that still a thing?

The *name* is both optional, and possibly just a *handle* of the user. If I'm sitting 5 ft away from someone at dinner and wanted to pay them via BLE, I might see "Monkey Dude" on my list and simply ask him "is that you?" If so, I send it. If there are two "Monkey Dude's" Then I have to bother with the address prefix, but not otherwise.

Then I guess a BIP would be useful regardless of the design issues. The prefix matching still feels flaky to me but it's hard to know if you could really swipe payments out of the air in practice, without actually trying it.
