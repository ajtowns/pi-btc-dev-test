You can imagine that instead of subsidy Bitcoin came with a initial
set of nlocktimed transactions that pay fees, one block at a time, for
each block from the start until the subsidy goes away.

Perhaps that mental model might make it clear why some people think
that the nlocked transactions and the block size being lower than the
instant offered demand (there is always a backlog) are both things
which address the concern of this thread. :)
