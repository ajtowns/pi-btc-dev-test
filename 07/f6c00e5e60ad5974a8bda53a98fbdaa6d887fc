If you're saying a block withholding attack is a nice weapon to have to
dissuade large pools, isn't that easily defeated by large pools simply
masquerading as multiple small pools? As, for all we know, ghash may have
done?

If you don't know who to attack there's no point in having the weapon.
While that weapon is still dangerous in the hands of others that are
indiscriminate, like the solo miners example of Peter Todd.

Sorry if i misunderstood your point.
