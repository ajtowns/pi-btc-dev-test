I saw it. I apologize for not including it in my list. I should have, for sake of discussion, even though I have a problem with it.

My problem with it is that "bitcoin days destroyed" is not a measure of demand for space in the block chain. In the distant future, when Bitcoin is the predominant global currency, bitcoins will have such high velocity that the number of bitcoin days destroyed in each block will be much lower than at present. Does this mean that the block size limit should be lower in the future than it is now? Clearly this would be incorrect.

Perhaps I am misunderstanding your proposal. Could you describe it more explicitly?
