I like that idea.

A third argument that is an array of private keys (in the same format
as the dumpprivkey RPC call) should be easy to support, assuming the
semantics are:

+ If third argument given, do not require that the wallet be unlocked,
and only sign using the private key(s) given (ignore the bitcoind
wallet entirely).
+ Private keys would stay in bitcoind memory only for the duration of
the RPC call.
