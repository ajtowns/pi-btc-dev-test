I am a huge fan of do-it-yourself at-home ASIC manufacturing. The original
4004 and earlier devices are within the scope of what could be accomplished
in a home environment. The homecmos project is an interesting glimpse at
these possibilities. Relevant-scale mining will most likely never be an
option for home manufacturing, but bitcoin wallets and other devices can
definitely be etched by hand or using maskless projector lithography.

Here's what the homecmos group was up to:

There's actually a method of doing this with conventional camera roll film:
