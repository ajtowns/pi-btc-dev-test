What meeting are you referring to?  Who were the participants?

Removing the limit but relying on the p2p protocol is not really a true
32MiB limit, but a limit of whatever transport methods provide.  This can
lead to differing consensus if alternative layers for relaying are used.
What you seem to be asking for is an unbound block size (or at least
determined by whatever miners produce).  This has the possibility (and even
likelihood) of removing many participants from the network, including many
small miners.

32MB in less than 3 years also appears to be far beyond limits of safety
which are known to exist far sooner, and we cannot expect hardware and
networking layers to improve by those amounts in that time.

It also seems like it would be much better to wait until SegWit activates
in order to truly measure the effects on the network from this increased
capacity before committing to any additional increases.
