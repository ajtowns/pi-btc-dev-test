I do not follow the argument that a critical design feature of a particular
"user activated soft fork" could be that it is users don't need to be
involved.  If the goal is user activation I would think that the
expectation would be that the overwhelming majority of users would be
upgrading to do it, if that isn't the case, then it isn't really a user
activated softfork-- it's something else.

So it has to be supported by the public but I can't say why I don't support
it? This seems extremely suspect to me.
