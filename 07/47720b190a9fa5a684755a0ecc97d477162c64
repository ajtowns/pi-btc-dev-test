I'm not a core dev, so maybe I have the power to change the consensus
rules.  No one has that power, actually, at least not legitimately.  All we
can do is build it and hope enough people find it acceptable to adopt.  Who
doesn't want to hard fork to 2MB blocks on May 5th and why not?

I have a bitcoin to be split up among all those who suffer from a May 5,
2016 hardfork to 2MB blocks if they can prove it to me, or prove it to
enough engineers that I succumb to peer pressure.  I would have to respect
the engineers though.

There!

Now that we've agreed to have a hard fork on May 5th, 2016, we might decide
to implement some other methods of avoiding the FFM, like braiding the
blockchain or flexcap, or just let anyone mining on top of a block make one
that is a five or ten Kb larger.
