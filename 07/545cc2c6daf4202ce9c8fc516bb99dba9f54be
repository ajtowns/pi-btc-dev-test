After the wallet split-off this will also be easier:

- Bitcoin Core Node
- Bitcoin Core Wallet

The node would be as compatible as possible with any OS in existence, but
the wallet can be more picky.

HSMs complicate this; I'm not even sure how this will work, are the Trezor
guys planning to contribute support for their device to wallets including
Bitcoin Core?

Hopefully by that time, everyone will have forgotten about XP already :)
