Note that nodes dying en-mass due to OOM failures is a relatively benign
failure mode as the point as which any particular node would die is
uncorrelated with other nodes - it won't cause a network fork.

Implementing a simple and stupid "while [ true ] do ; ./bitcoind ; done"
loop combined with ulimit to keep total memory usage to something sane
is a perfectly acceptable hack until proper mempool code with expiration
can be written. Gavin can talk more about his ideas in that regard.
