When I'm reviewing multiple commit pull-requests and want to see every
change made, I always either click on the "Files Changed" tab on github,
which collapses every commit into a single diff, or do the equivalent
with git log.

Why doesn't that work for you?

One advantage of using github is that they're an independent third
party; we should think carefully about the risks of furthering the
impression that Bitcoin development is a closed process by moving the
code review it to a server that we control with explicit review groups.

Given that Review Board appears to remain cryptographically unverifiable
there may also be disadvantages in operating it ourselves in that if the
review server does get compromised we *don't* have a third-party to
blame. In addition GitHub is a third-party with a very valuable
reputation to uphold and full-time staff - they're doing a better job of
keeping their servers secure and running then we ever could.
