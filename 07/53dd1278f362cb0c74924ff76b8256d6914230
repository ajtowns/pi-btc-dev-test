Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Clarification about SegWit transaction size and bech32
Message-ID: <001701d378cf$961e5510$c25aff30$@albertodeluigi.com>

Thank you Gregory,
so SegWit P2PHK have strictly less weight than P2WPKH, 3 fewer bytes (-1%) no matter the n. of outputs.
Instead, Segwit P2WPKH/P2SH cost 11% more than P2PHK, while compared to P2SH, SegWit transaction P2WSH and P2WSH/P2SH cost respectively 6% and 19% more space. And it can be much more if outputs are, as you say, an absurd number, which is the case of tx made by an exchange.

I understand there is a rationale for the overhead size. It's transparent from here: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits
I don't understand your two points, which are new to me, maybe I lack of some technical details?
1) outputs were previously undercosted
2) a great many TXOUTs are putting a serious long term cost on the network

But independently from that, my point is: does an exchange have economic incentives in adopting SegWit? I think the answer is no.
Does SegWit help making bitcoin more scalable? Not until Lightning Network, since transactions just take up more space. 

Instead, if bech32 really makes possible to save up to 22% of space (I still need confirmation), it would help a lot in scaling bitcoin. We just need to coordinate the network to bring it on most of the wallets. Since using bech32 everybody will benefit and pay smaller fees there are economic incentives in implementing it. For this reason I think an agreement about a transition to bech32 as default address for every wallet is a highly realistic scenario, while widespread SegWit adoption without bech32 is not, in my opinion, because poor or negative economic incentives (including also the costs companies sustain for development).

I know an agreement is a political matter, should it be discussed elsewhere?
I think a network upgrade to bech32 addresses requires the same coordination of a hard fork, but.. just a hint: bech32 helps saving space, in the meanwhile we reach widespread segwit adoption. If transition is achieved, we would have blocks of 2mb fulfilled with transactions using bech32, which have a 20% discount. Compared to the current situation of 1.05mb average blocks and 400k tx daily, we could have about 2mb blocks and 960k tx daily...

Thank you,
Alberto De Luigi

Alberto,

You are confused about the impact.  Ordinary P2WPKH have strictly less
weight no matter how many outputs you have.  P2WSH in very output heavy
transactions can be more, but this is inherent in the upgrade from
inadequate 80-bit security to 128-bit security, an intentional
change: because outputs were previously _radically_ undercosted in the
system and any party making a great many new TXOUTs are putting a serious
long term cost on the network,  and in any case it's except for transactions
that make an absurd number of P2WSH outputs at once the difference is pretty
small.
