Subject: [bitcoin-dev]  Fork of invalid blocks due to BIP66 violations
Message-ID: <COL402-EAS128602FDFB9DA83AC6C1BD2CD950@phx.gbl>

We need some analysis on why this has happened.? It appears the larger hashrate is violating BIP66.? Thus it appears the network is rejecting this BIP, though potentially accidentally.? If this is an accident, how is such a large portion of hashrate forking, and what can we do to avoid this in the future?
