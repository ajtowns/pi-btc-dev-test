The wiki page is meant to be a place to leave comments recommending or 
discouraging adoption of a completed BIP, after discussion is over. For 
example, many people seem to think BIP 38 is a good idea simply because it is 
a Final BIP, whereas in general we would want to discourage using it since it 
cannot really be used safely.

All review itself ought to remain on the ML.

Is this necessary considering the author-chosen forum may only be *in addition 
to* the Bitcoin Wiki?

It should be everything except accounts/passwords.
