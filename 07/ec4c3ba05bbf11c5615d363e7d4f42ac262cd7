I've always assumed honeypots were meant to look like regular, yet
poorly-secured, assets. If the intruder could identify this as a honeypot
by the strange setup (presigned, non-standard transactions lying around)
and was aware that the creator intended to doublespend as soon as the
transaction was discovered, wouldn't they instead prefer to not touch
anything and wait for a non-bait target to appear? Is the assumption here
that the intruder wouldn't know this is a honeypot, or that they would know
and it's just assumed that they would rather take their chances on this
instead of causing some other trouble?
