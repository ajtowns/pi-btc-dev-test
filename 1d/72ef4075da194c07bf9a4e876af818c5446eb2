That would partition off those clients, which is not something we
would want to happen.

This isn't possible until either BIP141 segwit is active or BIP141
segwit has expired.

We don't know that since bip9 bit1 only needs 55% hashpower to be
triggered(see BIP91 activation method for how this can be done)

BIP91 activation is clearly superior than trying to fully redeploy, it
is far simpler and can be done almost immediately with only miners
needing to upgrade.
