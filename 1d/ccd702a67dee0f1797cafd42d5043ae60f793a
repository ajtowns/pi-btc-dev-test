It is a very bad idea to delay relaying/accepting blocks based on
information which is only local to your node (ie would create the
ability for people to split the network by sending out lots of
double-spends to different parts of the network at the same time). Thus,
miners are incentivized to go connect to everyone on the network and
look for double-spends, not including them in their blocks to avoid
being delayed (which is OK, except having to connect to everyone is bad).
There is a related concept of "discouraging" blocks which generally only
refers to mining on a previous block, but you have to be careful doing
that so you dont break consensus.
