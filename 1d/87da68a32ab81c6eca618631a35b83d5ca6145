Naturally, I fully agree.

It seems I choose the wrong words, let me rephrase;

You can't roll the SegWit back a week after people are allowed to send 
segwit transactions (lock-in + fallow period). All transactions that were 
made in the mean time turn into everyone-can- spent transactions.

Because the network as a whole and any implementation is unable to roll back 
in an environment where SegWit is a contriversial soft-fork, it is super 
important to make sure that it is properly supported by all miners. This 
takes time and the risk you take by pushing this is that actual real people 
loose actual real money because of the issue I outlined inthe previous 
paragraph.

I hope the above explains the actual security issue better.
