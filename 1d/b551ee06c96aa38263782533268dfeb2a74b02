Maybe this helps undesrtanding the risks of a contentious/schism
hardfork: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/181/files#diff-e331b8631759a4ed6a4cfb4d10f473caR137
That section can be greatly improved though.

I have only skimmed the document, but I believe its conclusions (or
some of them) are right for the current propagation code.
The assumption may not stand if we move to something like IBLT though.
I believe that document also proves that it is
irrational/noncompetitive for miners to include ANY free transactions
at all (like they currently do).
But the analysis is about the effect of the maximum block size on
fees: there's more effects of that consensus rule.
The most important one being that it limits mining centralization (and
centralization in general).
This is true for at least 2 reasons: one is related to block
propagation and it is what is usually described.
At a bigger scale (even with crazy assumptions like constant time
infinite bandwidth, instant [superluminal] communication, zkSNARKS
block validity proofs ) minimum CPU costs will be something to limit
through the maximum block size consensus rule. There's a scale at
which the minimum CPU costs for a miner to be competitive may be so
high that some small miners without the resources to meet that minimum
will become unprofitable.
Admittedly we're not near that scale yet, but if something to take into account.

There are some simulations. See:
http://gavinandresen.ninja/are-bigger-blocks-better-for-bigger-miners

The goal of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6382 is to allow
people to do more realistic simulations (by using real full nodes).
That doesn't mean that more simplified simulations are worthless, but
I didn't want people to have to create their own testchain every time
they want to simulate a different size, like rusty had to do for:

http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=509

So the "incapacity to quantify the advantages that large miners have
over smaller ones" doesn't really exist.
It would be nice to have more data about this (more sizes, more
network topologies, etc) though.

Although smaller subsidies will remove some problems we currently
have, for example, SPV mining (there's no incentive to SPV mine
worthless empty blocks), I don't understand your claim that they will
also solve mining centralization problems related to block
propagation.

I really dislike basing the consensus rules on predictions about
future technology. For all I know, a terrible war could destroy half
of the global internet infrastructure in the next 5 years.
I prefer simpler increments like in bip102 (although I don't have the
data to know if 2MB is safe mining-centralization-wise at this point
[when mining centralization is pretty bad]).
Arguments against that kind of change are usually along the lines
"then we will have to repeat this same discussion in 1 or 2 years".
I believe that with the proper simulation tools being deployed and a
better general understanding of what the concerns are, the
conversation should be much simpler the next time.

Actually some simulations show they in fact have incentive to do just
that in some cases.
But more importantly, we shouldn't assume that all attackers are
rational miners. Maybe a potential attacker is a secret service or a
financial cartel attempting to destroy Bitcoin for whatever reason.

I truly hope that the discussion can move forward into more productive
territories after the workshop, and I'm particularly interested in
Peter R's presentation, even if I haven't found the time to read his
paper yet. Even if fees are not the main reason why we want to have a
block size maximum, fees are certainly very relevant and anything that
he has mathematically proven in that regard will be useful to this
discussion.
