>> Hello,

>> I am new, so apologies if this has been asked before.
>>
>> Here are a few questions to start with -
>>
>> I was wondering in terms of mass adoption, instead of long wallet
>> addresses, maybe there should be a DNS-like decentralized mapping service
>> to provide a user at crypto address?
>>
>> This address translation can happen with confirmations from the network.
>> So instead of providing a long string, or a QR code that needs an app, you
>> simply type in a human readable address, and the wallet software converts
>> it to a wallet address.
>>
>> Please let me know where I can research this more - if there already is
>> literature about this somewhere.
>>
>> thanks!
