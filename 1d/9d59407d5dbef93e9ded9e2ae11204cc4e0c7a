Nope. Tying the alt-coin difficulty to the Bitcoin difficulty isn't some
magic way to avoid a 51% attack - you still need a majority of
consensus. The attackers can still mine a conflicting chain and there's
still no reasonable way to choose between the two chains other than
proof-of-something. Even worse, then can do a data-hiding attack by
mining a conflicting chain without publishing the blockchain data, then
revealing it some time in the future, or just sowing FUD by making it
clear that the mining is happening. Like it or not crypto-coins solve
double-spending with proof-of-publication, and that can't be done
without some kind of mathematically verifiable majority aligned with the
interests of the crypto-coin users.

Recall that my zookeyv(1) and zerocoin alt(2) proposals from last summer
was specifically designed to take that situation into account, and of
course could at best only make it clear that it was happening and how
many Bitcoins needed to be sacrificed to make the chain secure.
