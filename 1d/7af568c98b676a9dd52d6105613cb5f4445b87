This is a long, unreasonable list of work.  None of this exists and it
equates to "upgrade all wallets and websites everywhere"  It requires all
exchanges, payment processors, merchants, etc. to  - basically everybody
but miners - to update.

It is a far, far larger amount of work to write, test and deploy than
simply increasing the block size limit.

Think through roll-out of these ambitious suggestions, before suggesting as
an alternative!

Not a realistic alternative except in an alternate universe where (a)
developer work at all companies is cost free, plus (b) we can pause the
business universe while we wait for The Perfect Solution.
