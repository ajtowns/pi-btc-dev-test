Yes, sweep (send all the coins from this addresses to me) should certainly
be added. Maybe even a way to do it periodically, though but that would
require remembering the key.

Importing private keys into the wallet will not be added as a user-friendly
option, as it is dangerous and potentially confusing.

As for (1), I think a better solution would to add a list of commands whose
arguments are censored in the console screen and command line history. At
least `importprivkey`, `walletpassphrase`, `walletpassphrasechange` should
likely be in that list.
