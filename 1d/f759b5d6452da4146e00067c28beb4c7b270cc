Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP for Legacy Sign Verify functions
Message-ID: <CAAUFj100ULfTbEorSK2PF5nvW-R_TCMOiboBBEMj+eS5upgU8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Although this is a well established functionality, it has never been
published in a BIP.  My proposal is simply to provide a reference point for
future expansion of these capabilities into new address schemes.

Original reference thread [Sign / Verify message against SegWit P2SH
addresses]
