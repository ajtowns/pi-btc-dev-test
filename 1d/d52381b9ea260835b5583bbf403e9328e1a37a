Ultimately, a self-interested miner will chose to build on the block that leaves the most transaction fees up for grabs. (This usually means the smallest block.) It's an interesting question whether the default behavior for Core should be the rational behavior (build on the "smallest" block in terms of fees) or some other supposedly altruistic behavior (most BTCDD). This also applies to the decision of the "same time" threshold -- a selfish miner will not care if the blocks arrived at about the same time or not.

I currently do not have a strong opinion on what that behavior should be, although if the blocksize limit were increased substantially, I may prefer the selfish behavior because it ends up also being fail-safe (punishes selfish mining using large blocks or fee-stealing attempts).

"Came in first" seems more easily gamed than "most oBTCDD".  As I wrote there, "old coins is always a dwindling resource and global nodes willing to help cheat is probably a growing one."

Surely, sufficient network bandwidth is a more broadly available commodity than <$0.02/kwh electricity, for example. I'm not sure that your stranded hydroelectric miner is any more desirable than thousands of dorm room miners with access to 10gbit university connections and free electricity.
