This is all in the realm of node policy, which must be easy to 
modify/customise in a flexible manner. So simplifying other code in a way that 
makes the policy harder to configure is not a welcome change.

That is, by making the code simpler, if you make custom policies (such as the 
current default) harder, it is better to leave the main code less simple.
