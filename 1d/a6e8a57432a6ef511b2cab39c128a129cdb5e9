The normalized TXID cannot depend on height for other transactions.
Otherwise, it gets mutated when been added to the chain, depending on
height.

An option would be that the height is included in the scriptSig for all
transactions, but for non-coinbase transctions, the height used is zero.

I think if height has to be an input into the normalized txid function, the
specifics of inclusion don't matter.

The previous txid for coinbases are required to be all zeros, so the
normalized txid could be to add the height to the txids of all inputs.
Again, non-coinbase transactions would have heights of zero.

I assumed that since the scriptSig in the coinbase is specifically intended
to be "random" bytes/extra nonce, so putting a restriction on it was
guaranteed to be backward compatible.
