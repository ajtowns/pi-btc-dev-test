What about using some interface, much like the JSON one (but more likely the 
zeroMQ one) instead? Would that not solve the problem?

I'm thinking that would not be a replacement for a full-node-connection but in 
addition.

Which means that some questions can be asked over that channel that you need 
authentication for. It would be a much better separation of concerns.
