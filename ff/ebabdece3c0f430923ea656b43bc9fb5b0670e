ACK

Good to do this sooner rather than later, as alert propagation on the P2P
network is going to continue to get less reliable as nodes upgrade to software
that has removed alert functionality; better that the final alert key
retirement message is reliably seen by the remaining software out there in a
predictable way than this be something that happens unpredictably.
