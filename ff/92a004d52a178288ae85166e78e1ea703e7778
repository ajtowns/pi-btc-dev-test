By "standard transaction" here, Rusty means that (P2SH or Segwit) scripts
that use the alt-stack pass the standardness checks and will be relayed by
recent Bitcoin Core software.

Regarding lowS:  I think the more severe standardness change was the added
requirement that (some of the) pubkeys in a multisig must be parsable.  I
have talked with people who cannot retrieve their funds now, when before
they could.  However, like lowS, this was only a change to the standardness
rules and not a consensus change, so these funds are not necessarily
permanently lost.  They can be retrieved with miner help.

I don't see how BIP 117, which is a change in consensus rules that could
cause permanent loss of otherwise well-secured funds (in addition to the
other issues raised about BIP 117), is even comparable to the previous
changes in only the standardness rules.
