Yes. Optionally layering Bitcoin over Tor/I2P is a much better option than
trying to replicate an onion network in Bitcoin itself. For one,  traffic
analysis is much more difficult if your onion routing network contains
multiple kinds of traffic. Also it would complicate the core algorithm and
waste developer time. Doing anonymity *right* is very hard. So let's leave
it to the Tor/I2P people that know what they're doing.

Except the part about making the client/network more resistant against DDoS.
