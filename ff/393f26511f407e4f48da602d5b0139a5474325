Any chance the blockchain.info iphone app could be included on the clients page? The source is available under an lGPL license: https://github.com/blockchain/My-Wallet-iPhone. More info:https://blockchain.info/wallet/iphone-app

Also the javascript web front end can be reviewed using a combination of https://github.com/blockchain/My-Wallet and https://github.com/blockchain/My-Wallet-Integrity-Checker but I could see why that might be more of an issue for the the official site.

Thank You,
Ben Reeves
