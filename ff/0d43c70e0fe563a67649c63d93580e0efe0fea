The hard part here will be including the players who aren't individually
"major", but are collectively important; who is the community?

How do you give the small merchants a voice in this discussion? The
small time traders? The small time miners? The people in repressive
countries who are trying to transact on thier own terms?

Legality? Should people involved in 3rd world remittances be
included? Even if what they're doing is technically illegal? What about
dark markets? If DPR voiced his opinion, should we ignore it?

Personally, I'm dubious about trying to make ecosystem-wide decisions
like this without cryptographic consensus; fuzzy human social consensus
is easy to manipulate.
