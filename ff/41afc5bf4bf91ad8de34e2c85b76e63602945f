Well, the bounty thing can't be automated, so, wouldn't publishing the
work you've done up to then by, for example, mailing this list, pretty
much guarantee someone else couldn't claim they fixed it all by
themselves anymore?

It could, however, end up with some quarrels about how much of the
bounty to give and to whom. Those are not nice things to have.
