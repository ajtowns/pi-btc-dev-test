You can prove ownership of a private key by signing a challenger-generated
nonce with the public part and giving the signature back to the challenger
- same as with any asymmetric crypto system.

As I already noted, the payment protocol is designed to solve that problem.
You could design a BIP that extended the payment protocol to include
information about the person who generated it.
