I believe this is a mischaracterization of the research conclusions.  The
actual conclusion was that the maximum value for the blocksize that the
network can safely handle (at that time) is some value that is
(conservatively) no more than 4MB.  This is because the research only
studies one aspect of the effect of blocksize on the network at a time and
the true safe value is the minimum of all aspects.  For example, the 4MB
doesn't cover the aspect of quadratic hashing for large transactions in
large blocks.
