The ordering is by the bits in the hash. Technically it's a Patricia Trie.
I'm using 'merkle tree' to refer to basically anything with a hash root.

That is unspecified in the implementation, it just takes a 256 bit value
which is presumably a hash of something. The intention is to nail down a
simple format and demonstrate good performance and leave those semantics to
a higher layer. The simplest thing would be to hash together the txid and
output number.
