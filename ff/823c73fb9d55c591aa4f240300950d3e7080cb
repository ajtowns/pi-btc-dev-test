Hello all,

I've just tagged v0.1.0 of my bitcoin-seeder program on github:

  https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder

This is the program powering the DNS seed on seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.

It is a crawler for the bitcoin network, with integrated DNS server.

It's not more than a preview release with only mininal functionality. Missing
features include:
* logging
* some configuration options
* daemonization
* ...

It has however been running without problem on my node for over a week now,
so I'm releasing it. Comments and questions are welcome.

The program regularly dumps its database in dnsseed.dat, allowing fast
reinitialization. As the program is far from finished, I do not guarantee that
the file format will remain compatible with future versions.
