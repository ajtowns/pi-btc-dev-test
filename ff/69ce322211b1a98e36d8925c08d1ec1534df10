uh. and so when my solution is, by chance, unusually low... I am
incentivized to hurry up and release my block because?

I've simulated non-first-block-heard strategies in the past (in the
two nearly tied miner with network latency model) and they result in
significant increase in large (e.g. >>6 block) reorgs). It's easy to
make convergence worse or to create additional perverse incentives.
