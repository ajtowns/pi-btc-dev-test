Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 2: BIP process, revised (review please)
Message-ID: <201610151301.35687.luke@dashjr.org>

BIP 2 is currently believed to be a final draft of what will replace BIP 1 in 
specifying how the entire BIP process works. This Process BIP will require 
rough consensus from the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to become Active (see BIP 2 
for the procedure, which I intend to use for its own activation due to absence 
of a clear process defined in BIP 1).

Therefore, if you have any objections to the new BIP process as specified in 
BIP 2, please voice your concerns ASAP.

Thanks for your review,

Luke
