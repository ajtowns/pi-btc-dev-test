Since we don't know what sort of address changes will happen later on, you
could make this future-proof by passing a list of addresses to `addr`.

The syntax is

bitcoin:<address>[?addr=<address>[,<address>[,<address>]]]

The addresses passed as a comma-separated list to the `addr` parameter are
in descending order of preference, with highest first. A consumer of this
URI should attempt to understand each address in the list before falling
back to the next address and finally to the base address after `bitcoin:`.

Example:

bitcoin:3xBase58compatibleAddress?addr=fancyFutureEncoding0x01,bech32address1qx01

The spending wallet would attempt to spend to "fancyFutureEncoding0x01"
then to "bech32address1qx01" and finally to "3xBase58compatibleAddress".

Thanks,

-Clark
