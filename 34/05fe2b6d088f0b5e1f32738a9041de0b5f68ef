I don't think that any kind of peer disconnection should be present in the reference client implementation.  This is a lot like using packet filters and stateful firewalls - they are implemented based on local policy and they require constant tweaking because they always cause problems when some change in usage dictates allowing things that weren't allowed before.  Essentially every new service, protocol (or creative use of an existing protocol) needs to be 'opened up' so it's a hassle to change it each time.

Perhaps there is a use for this in helping implement local policy but even something that's considered a 'liberal' filtering rule today will eventually be in the way of something legitimate and will need to be adjusted.  It is not possible to just adjust this network wide when and adjustment needs to be created, so any type of built-in filtering is limiting to future innovation.

Maybe this type of thing would be better implemented in a separate bitcoin proxy - much like how a firewall can be placed between a router and network.  All traffic is legitimate to a router (bitcoind) if it's formatted correctly and can be forwarded, but the firewall can implement local policy.  The problem with providing this out-of-the-box is that even in the case of internet traffic, they are often misused and configured too restrictively so they end up causing service problems for the users behind them.

I think the idea is good, in that we need a way to filter out things we consider bad, but I don't think it is the job of the bitcoin client.  There are tons of tunable things and people will want to tweak them - what is 'a lot' to me might be nothing to someone else.  People's policies will differ greatly as you can see with everything else on the internet.
