I like the bitcoin days destroyed idea.

I like lots of the ideas that have been presented here, on the bitcointalk
forums, etc etc etc.

It is easy to make a proposal, it is hard to wade through all of the
proposals. I'm going to balance that equation by completely ignoring any
proposal that isn't accompanied by code that implements the proposal (with
appropriate tests).

However, I'm not the bottleneck-- you need to get the attention of the
other committers and convince THEM:

a) something should be done "now-ish"
b) your idea is good

We are stuck on (a) right now, I think.
