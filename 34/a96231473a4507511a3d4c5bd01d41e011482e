>From this question one could think that when you said "we can do the
cleanup hardfork later" earlier you didn't really meant it. And that
you will oppose to that hardfork later just like you are opposing to
it now.
As said I disagree that making a softfork first and then move the
commitment is less disruptive (because people will need to adapt their
software twice), but if the intention is to never do the second part
then of course I agree it would be less disruptive.
How long after the softfork would you like to do the hardfork?
1 year after the softfork? 2 years? never?
