Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin difficulty sanity check suggestion
Message-ID: <CAO7N=i1_ZyGBAsOGdCvPwJNhARbe-MuWzi9MYLsa3WS_PO25hg@mail.gmail.com>

I think Bitcoin should have a sanity check: after three days if only four
blocks have been mined, difficulty should be adjusted downwards.

This might become important in the near future. I project a Bitcoin mining
bubble.
