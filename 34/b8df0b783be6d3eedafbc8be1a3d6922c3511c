We are not establishing an IETF working group, which is an option that
was explored prior to the Paris meeting and has been sidelined at
present for depth-of-bureaucracy by the backing commercial entities.
Rather, we are establishing a top-level IANA registry group. This is
not anticipated by the IETF old-guard working with us to be either (a)
controversial or (b) possible to block.
