I don't recall being contacted directly, but the attack has been
discussed.  It relies on a number of conditions.  For example, if you are
over Tor, they try to kick the machine off Tor, _assuming_ that it will
fall back to non-Tor.  That's only true for dual stack nodes, which are not
really 100% anonymous anyway -- you're operating from your public IP anyway.
