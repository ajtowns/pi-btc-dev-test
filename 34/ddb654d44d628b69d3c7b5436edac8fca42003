Right. Why anyone would want to do this intentionally, however, is not
clear. The coins would be worth less as they wouldn't be fungible across
the chains anymore.

This is something that hadn't entered my mind when I made my assertions. At
the moment I can't see any way to avoid this fact.

Also any transaction whos casual history extends from one of the above

Wallets could detect this and notify the user. Due to Gresham's Law, I'll
admit the observation that these outputs would likely get spent in
preference (as they are less fungible), but whether the payee would be
happy to accept them is a different matter.

Well in your example they wouldn't, because they know that your version
wouldn't be accepted by the economic majority. But it's not as clear cut
for the larger blocks case. They may move over gradually as they see the
new chain gain acceptance, demonstrated by the higher trading volume on it.
