However you want. The P2P network isn't all the essential to bitcoin.
With patches you can import and export transactions to text from a
regular client.

The distributed algorithm and the block chain are far more essential
to bitcoin than the p2p network is, you could interconnect all bitcoin
systems with morse code operators running spark gap transmitters with
nary an IP packet in sight and it would still be bitcoin.
