The fact that some implementations ban an invalid block hash and some do not, suggests that it?s not a pure p2p protocol issue. A pure p2p split should be unified by a bridge node. However, a bridge node is not helpful in this case. Banning an invalid block hash is an implicit ?first seen? consensus rule.

The blocks that previously built on the original are still able to do so but presumably cannot build forever on the *new* block as it has a different tx. But other new blocks can. There is no chain split due to a different interpretation of valid, there are simply two valid competing chains.

Pretty far to reach to not even get a chain split, but it could produce a deep reorg with a very low chance of success. As I keep telling people, deep reorgs can happen, they are just unlikely, as is this scenario.

Permanent blocking as you describe it would be a p2p protocol design choice, having nothing to do with consensus. Libbitcoin for example does not ban invalidated hashes at all. It just discards the block and drops the peer.
