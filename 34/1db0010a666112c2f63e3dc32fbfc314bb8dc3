Seems to me an obvious use case for drive chains are to have high speed
small transactions on a side chain, eventually cleared to the main chain.

Not sure why miners would want this to fail any more than any other side
chain, like Liquid or lightning.

That's not at all true. If I'm a miner with a better capability than another
miner to prevent that theft, I have reasons to induce it to happen to give
me
political cover to pushing that other miner off the network.

This is a very similar problem to what we had with zeroconf double-spending,
where entities such as Coinbase tried to pay off miners to guarantee
something
that wasn't possible in a geninely decrentralized system: safe zeroconf
transactions.

Why are you forcing miners to run this code at all?

Equally, you're opening up miners to huge political risks, as rejecting all
withdrawals is preventing users' from getting their money, which gives other
miners a rational for kicking those miners off of Bitcoin entirely.

Why do you think this will be infrequent? Miners with a better ability to
validate the drivechain have every reason to make these events more
frequent.

This is also a very dubious security model - I would argue that Bitcoin is
much
*more* valuable if miners do everything they can to ensure that drivechains
fail, given the huge risks involved. I would also argue that users should do
user-activated-soft-forks to ensure they fail.

By comparison, note Adam Back and my own efforts to ensure miners have a
smaller part in the ecosystem, with things like committed (encrypted)
transactions and my closed-seal-set/truth-list approach(1). We want to
involve
miners as little as possible in the consensus, not more.

I have to ask: What use-cases do you actually see for drivechains? Why can't
those use-cases be done in the much safer client-side validation fashion?
