No, the problem was that the transaction MtGox produced was poorly
formatted.

It wouldn't cause a block containing the transaction to be rejected, but
the default client wouldn't relay the transaction or add it into a block.

This means that transaction stalls.

If the attacker has a direct connection to MtGox, they can receive the
transaction directly.

The attacker would fix the formatting (which changes the transaction id,
but doesn't change the signature) and then forward it to the network, as
normal.

The old transaction never propagates correctly.

Up to this point the attacker has nothing gained. But next the attacker

They sent out the transaction a second time.

The right solution is that the new transaction should re-spend at least one
of the coins that the first transaction spent.  That way only one can
possibly be accepted.
