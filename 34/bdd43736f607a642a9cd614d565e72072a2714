Moxie was designed to be small and efficient from the compiler standpoint.
As a side effect, it is easy to audit from a security perspective.  It
started life as a simulator + gcc compiler backend, and then later became
an FPGA implementation.

Moxie would benefit from focused effort in building out the hardware side
to be efficient on FPGA, developing and testing multi-core support and
related efforts.  This area is less mature and could use attention.  Start
at https://github.com/atgreen/moxiedev/tree/master/moxie/cores/moxie

In terms of other projects, there are many open source processor cores at
http://opencores.org
