But if they can truncate they can just as well pass a completely
different hash that matches their payment request. If an attacker can
change the bitcoin: URI, this scheme is broken.

The point of the proposal is to make sure that the payment request
matches the URI. So *if* you communicate the URI by secure means, this
authenticates the associated payment request as well, even if fetched
by insecure means (such as http:...) itself.
