I think it would be more accurate to say that the requirement is that
reversal doesn't happen unexpectedly.

If it is clear in the script that reversal is possible, then obviously the
recipient can take that into consideration.

Key management is a thing.  Managing risk by keeping some keys offline is
an important part of that.

BitGo has an "instant" system where they promise to only sign one
transaction for a given output.  If you trust BitGo, then this is safe from
double spending, since a double spender can't sign two transactions.

If BitGo had actually implemented a daily withdrawal limit, then their
system ends up similar to cold storage.  Only 10% of the funds at Bitfinex
could have been withdrawn before manual intervention was required (with
offline keys).

Obviously, if a payment is reversible, then you treat it as a reversible
payment.  The protection here relates to moving coins from the equivalent
of cold storage to hot storage.

It is OK if it takes longer, since security is more important than
convenience for coins in cold storage.

This relates to the reserves held by the exchange.  A portion of the funds
are in hot storage with live keys.  These funds can be stolen by anyone who
gets access to the servers.  The remaining funds are held in cold storage
and they cannot be accessed unless you have the offline keys.  These funds
are supposed to be hard to reach and require manual intervention.

Setting up offline keys to act as firebreaks is part of good security
practices.
