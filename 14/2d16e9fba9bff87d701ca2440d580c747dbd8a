Ok, cool, I wasn't aware of such services, and I can certainly see
they could be useful.  But it's not that great for the business card

As far as I can see, using it in that scenario would have to rely on
the payer scanning the QR code on the business card, and then check
that the email address displayed by their wallet matched the email
address printed on the business card.
