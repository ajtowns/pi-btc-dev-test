I don't think that rights are a pillar of how bitcoin works - rather I
would say it's a matter of aligned incentives. The fact is that the
majority technically *can* dictate through PoW and acceptance. The only
reason that the majority would not chose this path is because there is
greater economic value in consensus, whether perceived or realized.

If bitcoin were about "doing the right thing" there wouldn't be a need for
PoW since no individual would be incentivized to double spend.
