Maybe it already exists ...

#9484 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9484> 812714f
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/812714f> Introduce assumevalid
setting to skip validation presumed valid scripts (gmaxwell)
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9484

..., but ...
It would be very interesting if a new node could decide to be a pruned node:
  - it would need to trust one or more peers for the initial blockchain
download, because the blocks downloaded would not be validated
  - it would decide a time from when to get the blocks, like a week before
  - once a day a routine would run that would prune blocks older than the
chosen time

"

*The unspent transaction outputs (which is the only essential piece ofdata
necessary for validation) are already kept in a separate database,so
technically removing old blocks is perfectly possible.*" Pieter Wuille
