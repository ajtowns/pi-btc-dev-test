For those loosely following the technical issues from outside development
circles, but who may be pressed into a voting/adoption type position (miners,
users, investors)... is there a parallel presentation of the concepts and
arguments from the other side (both, or the various, sides) that they
can refer to?
Someplace where they are collated and presented? A wiki perhaps?
Are these even valid or necessary questions?
