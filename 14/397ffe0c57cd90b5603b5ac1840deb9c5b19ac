Jorge, first, thanks again for your work on this.

Without creating and using a public blockchain interface in phase 2, how
will you isolate the database dependency from consensus critical code?
Is it that the interface will exist but you will recommend against its use?

This work presumes that the users of the library reject the argument
that the database implementation is consensus critical code. Faithful
reproduction of stored data is a prerequisite for a validity. But a
common store implementation is only slightly more reasonable for this
library than a common RAM implementation.
