Your proposal forces wallets to use the derivation path in order to
determine the type of output script. it will work only in the context of
BIP43.

Therefore, it should not be proposed as a BIP32 improvement, but as a
improvement of BIP43.

A solution is still needed to wallets who do not wish to use BIP43
