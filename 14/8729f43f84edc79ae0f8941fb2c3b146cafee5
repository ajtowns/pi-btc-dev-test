Is there a reason you prefer doing the M-1 offset as opposed to limiting
the range to 255 instead? Seems like something that will certainly confuse
some developers in exchange for adding one more value at the high end of a
range. I don't gather there's much difference between 255 and 256 here is
there? Also requires the small bit of explanation to hang around as a rider
in all future documentation, and the name of the field may not be
self-documenting anymore.

By way of predicting how I'm wrong, perhaps it is better to have a field
where all possible values are legitimate (by not biasing you would have to
check it's not zero), or perhaps it's important that powers of 2 be
represented here? Perhaps there's some use case at 256 that 255 just won't
do for?

I'm mostly just curious, as I find problems and funnies crop up when people
get clever with optimization of things like message bit-packing etc.. If
it's not necessary then maybe better to keep to what's intuitive (i.e. the
girls name is clear and self-documenting)

Anyway enough of my bike shedding!
