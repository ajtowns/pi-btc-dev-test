In this case I don?t understand how your implementation won?t be DoS-ed. An attacker could keep sending you inv for the same block / transaction. Since you don?t assume the hash is unique, each time you have to download the block/tx again before you could tell if that is the same one you have already known. Otherwise, you are implementing the ?first seen? rule.

Also, you can?t ban a peer just because you get an invalid tx from him, because he might be referring to a hash-colliding UTXO that you don?t know. In that case you need to request for the parent tx to verify. I wonder if you are really doing that.

The block hash duplicate check (it's not fork-point relative) and signature verification caching. Like the "block banning" issue above, the latter is related to an internal optimization. I would categorize the former as a simple oversight that presumably goes way back.
>

First understand that it is not possible for consensus rules to invalidate blocks based on order of arrival. As such any *implementation* that invalidates blocks based on order of arrival is broken. It is an error to claim that these behaviors are part of consensus, despite being implemented in the satoshi node(s).

To be a consensus rule all nodes must be able to independently reach the same validity conclusion, given the same set of blocks, independent of order. If this is not the case the behavior is not a consensus rule, it is simply a bug. 
> 
> Deviating from such bugs is not a break with consensus, since such non-rules cannot be part of consensus. One node implementation can behave deterministically while others are behaving non-deterministically, with the two nodes remaining consistent from a consensus standpoint (deterministic produces a subset of non-deterministic results). But, unlike arbitrary nodes, deterministic nodes will not cause disruption on the network.

The hash of a block is not the block itself, a logically-correct ban would be to compare the wire serialization of the block as opposed to the hash, or not maintain the feature at all.

I am not aware of any other non-determinism in Core, but I don't spend a lot of time there. There is no need to study other implementations to ensure determinism, as that can be verified independently.
>

Fixing/preventing these bugs is responsible development behavior, and does not require forks or BIPs, since Bitcoin doesn't inherently contain any such bugs. They are the consequence of incorrect implementation, and in two of the three cases above have resulted from supposed optimizations. But any code that creates non-determinism in exchange for speed, etc. is not an optimization, it's a bug. A node must implement its optimizations in a manner that does not alter consensus.

However the results are both a clear break from previous (and documented) consensus but also produce a very undesirable outcome - destruction of all unspent outputs in the "replaced" transaction for starters. So this is a distinct category, not a determinism bug but a hard fork that produces undesired consequences.
> 
> The BIP30 regression hard fork actually enables the various pathological scenarios that you were describing, where no such issues existed in Bitcoin consensus previously. It is now possible to produce a block that mutates another arbitrarily deep block, and forces a reorg all the way back to the mutated block. This was done to save microseconds per block. Despite the improbability of hash collisions, I find this deplorable and the lack of public discussion on the decision concerning.
> 
> With respect to the original post, the point at issue is the introduction of another hard fork, with some odd behaviors, but without any justification apart from tidying up the small amount of necessary code. These issues are related in that they are both consensus forks that have been introduced as supposed optimizations, with no public discussion prior to release (or at least merging to master with the presumption of shipping in the latter case). Two of the three hash collision issues above are also related in that they are bugs introduced by a desire to optimize internals.
> 
> The engineering lesson here should be clear - watch out for developers bearing optimizations. A trade against correctness is not an optimization, it's a break. Satoshi was clearly a fan of the premature optimization. FindAndDelete is a howler. So this is a tradition in Bitcoin. My intent is not to sling mud but to improve the situation.
> 
> It is very possible to produce straightforward and deterministic code that abides consensus and materially outperforms Core, without any of the above optimization breaks, even avoiding the utxo set optimization. Even the tx (memory) and block (orphan) pools are complex store denormalizations implemented as optimizations. Optimizing before producing a clean conceptual model architecture and design is a software development anti-pattern (premature optimization). The proposed fork is a premature optimization. There are much more significant opportunities to better organize code (and improve performance). I cannot support the decision to advance it.
> 
> I was unaware Core had regressed BIP30. Given that the behavior is catastrophic and that it introduces the *only* hash-collision consensus misbehavior (unless we consider a deep reorg sans the otherwise necessary proof of work desirable behavior), I strongly recommend it be reverted, with a post-mortem BIP.
> 
> Finally I recommend people contemplate the difference between unlikely and impossible. The chance of random collision is very small, but not zero. Colliding hashes is extremely difficult, but not impossible. But Bitcoin does not rely on impossibility for correct behavior. It relies of difficulty. This is a subtle but important distinction that people are missing.
> 
> Difficulty is a knowable quantity - a function of computing power.  If hash operations remain difficult, Bitcoin is undeterred. Collisions will have no impact, even if they happen with unexpected frequency (which would still be vanishingly infrequent). If the difficulty of producing a collision is reduced to the point where people cannot rely on addresses (for example), then Bitcoin has a problem, as it has become a leaky ship (and then there's mining). But with the unnecessary problems described above, a single hash collision can be catastrophic. Unlike difficulty, which is known, nobody can know when a single collision will show up. Betting Bitcoin, and potentially the world's money, on the unknowable is poor reasoning, especially given that the cost of not doing so is so very low.

The blocks that previously built on the original are still able to do so but presumably cannot build forever on the *new* block as it has a different tx. But other new blocks can. There is no chain split due to a different interpretation of valid, there are simply two valid competing chains.

Pretty far to reach to not even get a chain split, but it could produce a deep reorg with a very low chance of success. As I keep telling people, deep reorgs can happen, they are just unlikely, as is this scenario.

Permanent blocking as you describe it would be a p2p protocol design choice, having nothing to do with consensus. Libbitcoin for example does not ban invalidated hashes at all. It just discards the block and drops the peer.
