The extranonce rolling doesn't necessarily need to happen in the ASIC itself. 
With the current extranonce-in-gentx, an old RasPi 1 can only handle creating 
work for up to 5 Gh/s with a 500k gentx.

Furthermore, there is a direct correlation between ASIC speeds and difficulty, 
so increasing the extranonce space dynamically makes a lot of sense.

I don't see any reason *not* to increase the minimum difficulty at the same 
time, though.
