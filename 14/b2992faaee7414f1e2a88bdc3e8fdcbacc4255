Thank you all for the feedback.

I will change the data structure as follows:

* There will be only one output, the "pop output", and no outputs from
T will be copied to the PoP.
* The pop output will have value 0.
* The sequence number of all inputs of the PoP will be set to 0. I
chose to set it to 0 for all inputs for simplicity.
* The lock_time of the PoP is always set to 499999999.

Any comments on this?
