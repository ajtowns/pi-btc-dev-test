I feel your pain. I've had the same thing happen to me in the past. And I
agree it's more likely to occur with my proposed scheme but I think with HD
wallets there will still be UTXOs left unspent after most transactions
since, for privacy sake it's looking for the smallest set of addresses that
can be linked.
