In some rare occasions in everyday life, what matters is seconds. Like when
paying for parking in the car while some other cars are behind you in the
line. You don't want them to get upset.

I takes me tens of minutes to shop. But once you choose your merchandise
and your payment starts processing, if the payment system allows several
payments to be pending simultaneously and you're not blocking the next
person to pay, then I don't care waiting some minutes for confirmation. But
saving 10 minutes of confirmation is a lot.

I ague that our time is mostly measured in minutes (but I don't have any
sociological, cultural, genetic or anthropological evidence). It takes
minutes to read an e-mail, minutes to correct a bug, minutes to have lunch,
minutes to drive to the office, minutes to talk to your kids. A payment
taking 1 minute is much better than a payment taking 10. If I could choose
a single thing to change to Bitcoin, I would lower the payment time, even
within the minute scale.
