I was rather surprised by the tweet from AntPool[1] today saying that
they support big blocks and would be prepared to upgrade to XT. Pools
have stated that they are willing to increase to a maximum of 8MB, but
upgrading to XT puts them on a schedule towards 8GB which is clearly
not what they have agreed to.

Do you have any insights into what's going on there?

Also do you have any insight into what Chinese pools would accept as a
compromise in terms of raising the blocksize limit?
