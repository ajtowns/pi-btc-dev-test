When I can pick up a miner at Best Buy and pay it off in 9 months I'll 
agree with you that bitcoin *might* be decentralized. Maybe there's a 
chance this *will* happen eventually, but right now we have a couple of
mining cartels that control most of the hashrate.

There are plenty of interesting alt-hash-chains for which mass produced,
general purpose (or gpgpu-purpose) hardware exists and is in high volume
mass production.
