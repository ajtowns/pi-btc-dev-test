Well, if your investors take money with market manipulating news stories,
this is absolutely the responsible thing to do to increase shareholder
value with a future opportunity to cause a crash-on-demand.

Besides, if you really want microtransactions, you should be using an
altcoin with faster block times, smaller market cap, and larger 'human'
readable currency supply.

That being said, I'd say include the change, we all know about it. What
would be nice would be some exploits and attack signatures for what the
DOS will look like when it hits so that those of us paying attention
can make some money trading in anticipation of the market crash instead
of just the guys paying for the attack.

The real killer feature of Bitcoin is that we can learn from it's mistakes
(and bitcoin can learn from the copycatcoins), instead of one-size-fits
all fiat.
