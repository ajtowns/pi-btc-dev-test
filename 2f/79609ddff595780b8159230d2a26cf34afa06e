"Thus we have a fixed capacity system where access is mediated by supply
and demand transaction fees."

There is no supply and demand. That would mean users would be able to adapt
fees and get different quality of service depending on current capacity.
For example if peak load is 10x average load, then at those times fees
would be higher and users would delay transactions to smooth out demand.
