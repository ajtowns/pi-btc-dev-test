Great stuff Matt!

I have an implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing here: https://github.com/bitsofproof/bop-bitcoin-client-misc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/bitsofproof/supernode/misc/ShamirsSecretSharing.java

What was missing was nice serialization. Thanks a lot for defining and starting the process.

 I will shortly adapt my code and check your test vectors.

Regards,

> Abstract: A method is described for dividing a Bitcoin private key into shares in a manner such that the key can be reconstituted from any sufficiently large subset of the shares but such that individually the shares do not reveal any information about the key. This method is commonly known as Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. Additionally, an encoding methodology is proposed to standardize transmission and storage of shares.
