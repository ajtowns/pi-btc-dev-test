No, accidental. I'll re-CC it on this email.

Regtest isn't really a network at all, just a testing mode of Bitcoin Core...

Is that a bad thing?

Sorry, I meant to stress that BIPs are for *Bitcoin* improvements 
specifically. Things which only improve altcoins, while a perfectly fine thing 
to standardise, are outside the scope of what belongs in a BIP.

Perhaps, however, this could be made to kill 2 birds with one stone, by 
ensuring it addresses the need for payments made of bitcoins on a sidechain?
For this, a merchant who wants a sidechain payment would presumably be able to 
provide a script from the main chain already, but an extension allowing 
payment directly on the sidechain (at the customer's choice) avoids the need 
to round-trip it...
