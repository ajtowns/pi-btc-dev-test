Continually repeating this statement without defining terms or providing
evidence does not make it true or informative.

"Decentralization" is a popular buzzword these days, but how about
stating the problem description in a way that is more precise and accurate?

One of Bitcoin's differentiating properties is that it prevents double
spending without using a trusted third party.

Now instead of arguing about some nebulous "decentralization" that
nobody can define or measure, we can talk about more helpful questions like:

Under what circumstances will miners and/or nodes behave as a trusted
third party (collusion)?

What incentives exist which increase, and which reduce, any tendencies
that may exist for nodes to collude?

In what ways specifically does MAX_BLOCK_SIZE relate to either of the
following questions?
