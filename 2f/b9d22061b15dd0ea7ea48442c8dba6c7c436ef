I wouldn't say same trade-off because you need the whole 20mb block before you can start to use it where as a 1mb block can be used quicker thus transactions found in tge block quicker etc. As for tge higher rate of orphans, I think this would be complimented by a faster correction rate, so if you're pumping out blocks at a rate of 1 per minute, if we get a fork and the next block comes in 10 minutes and is the decider, it took 10 minutes to determine which block is the orphan. But at a rate of 1 block per 1 minute then it only takes 1 minute to resolve the orphan (obviously this is very simplified) so I'm not so sure that orphan rate is a big issue here. Indeed you would need to draw upon more confirmations for easier block creation but surely that is not an issue?

Why would sync time be longer as opposed to 20mb blocks?

But don't you see the same trade-off in the end there? You're still
propagating the same amount of data over the same amount of time, so unless
I misunderstand, the costs of such a move should be approximately the same,
just in different areas. The risks as I understand are as follows:

20MB:


   1. Longer per-block propagation (eventually)
   2. Longer processing time (eventually)
   3. Longer sync time

1 Minute:

   1. Weaker individual confirmations (approx. equal per confirmation*time)
   2. Higher orphan rate (immediately)
   3. Longer sync time

That risk-set makes me want a middle-ground approach. Something where the
immediate consequences aren't all that strong, and where we have some idea
of what to do in the future. Is there any chance we can get decent network
simulations at various configurations (5MB/4min, etc)? Perhaps
re-appropriate the testnet?
