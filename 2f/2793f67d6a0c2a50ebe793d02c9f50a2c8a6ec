I think there may be a simpler way to do this.

Create a new genesis block for a staging network, but in all other aspects,
as far as possible, keep the properties the same as bitcoin.

Do not actively be opposed to it being traded, but people need to know
that, although there is no intention to reset the chain, new and
potentially not fully tested, changes can be rolled into the network.
Anyone mining staging coins should be prepared for the value to go to zero.

Perhaps also a "straw poll" voting system could be set up for those that
own staging coins could sign messages saying which patches they would like
to test out next.  When patches are stable in the staging area, they could
be "promoted" to the main net ...
