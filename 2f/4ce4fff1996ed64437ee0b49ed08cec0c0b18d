Very interesting Matt.

For what it's worth, in future bitcoinj is very likely to bootstrap from
Cartographer nodes (signed HTTP) rather than DNS, and we're also steadily
working towards Tor by default. So this approach will probably stop working
at some point. As breaking PorcFest would kind of suck, we might want a
ZeroConf/Rendezvous solution in place so local LANs can capture Bitcoin
traffic away from Tor (with some notification to the user, presumably).
