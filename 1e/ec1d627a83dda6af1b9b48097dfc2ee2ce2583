Sure, if you accept that mostly is not fully - just as unlikely is not
impossible.

That's like saying, as long as we exclude car accidents from
consideration, car accidents are impossible.

I generally try to avoid speaking in tautologies :)

This is not the case.

Block hash duplicates within the same chain are invalid as a matter of
consensus, which is the opposite of assuming impossibility.

Tx hash collisions are explicitly allowed in the case that preceding tx
with the same hash is unspent. This is also not a reliance on the
impossibility of hash collision. Core certainly implements this distinction:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L2419-L2426

Address hashes and script hashes can collide without harming the
security of Bitcoin (although address owner(s) may experience harm).
Rare in this case is sufficient because of this distinction.

Compact blocks contemplates hash collisions:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki#Random_collision_probabilty

Checkpoints aren't part of Bitcoin security, so even the remote
possibility of two different potential blocks, with the same hash, at
the same height in the same chain, does not indicate a problem.

There is no case where the security of Bitcoin assumes that hashes never
collide. Consensus rules have specific handling for both block hash
collisions and tx hash collisions.
