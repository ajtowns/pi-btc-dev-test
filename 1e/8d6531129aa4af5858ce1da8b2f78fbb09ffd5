I'm not talking about keeping logs, I mean purporting to be a network
peer in order to gain a connection slot and then not behaving as one
(not relaying transactions), thereby depriving the peers to which
operator actually intends to offer service of the ability to connect.

That someone wants to run a large number of nodes in order to make
their own logs more saleable, does not mean they are entitled to break
the protocol to make other node operators subsidize their log collection.

Especially if a data collection company is deploying nodes that do not
relay and aggressively reconnect after a ban, it seems like they'd
have a hard time arguing that they were not knowingly exceeding
authorized access.
