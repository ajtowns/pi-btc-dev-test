So if we would have 8 MB blocks, and there is a sudden influx of users (or
settlement systems, who serve much more users) who want to pay high fees
(let's say 20 transactions per second) making the block chain inaccessible
for low fee transactions, and unreliable for medium fee transactions (for
any value of low, medium, and high), would you be ok with that? If so, why
is 8 MB good but 1 MB not? To me, they're a small constant factor that does
not fundamentally improve the scale of the system. I dislike the outlook of
"being forever locked at the same scale" while technology evolves, so my
proposal tries to address that part. It intentionally does not try to
improve a small factor, because I don't think it is valuable.

It's exactly as centrally limited as the finite supply of BTC - by
consensus. You and I may agree that a finite supply is a good thing, and
may disagree about whether a consensus rule about the block size is a good
idea (and if so, at what level), but it's a choice we make as a community
about the rules of the system we want to use.
