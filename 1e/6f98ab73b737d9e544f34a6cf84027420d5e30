Sync... yes, depending on the rate/sec and size of them, that would be an
issue. "Enterprise" systems with UPS, good disk, etc assume writes are
committed upon return, eliminating need for software apps to do sync. So
I need to figure out how to turn that off?

Is sync on for everything, or just the wallet (where it could be argued as ok)?

Guessing bitcoin's writes are small? So a RAM dev intent would be cheaper
and faster than SSD for that.

I'll try to search that. If it's anything like "delete old blocks/tx/coins that
have both been validated in the past and fully spent in the future since we
no longer need to validate further back beyond them [1]", that would be
interesting.

[1] Unless you're a historian or some usage other than casual transactions.
