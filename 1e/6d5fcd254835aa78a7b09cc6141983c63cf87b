>Bitcoin does not enjoy nearly the popularity that marijuana and guns do,

Marijuana is an individual activity. Precisely the problem with Bitcoin you envision, where each one of us could be easily jailed.

Guns are quite different: they have NRA and judging by how successful it is at fending _any_ sort of gun control laws, it can very effectively counter-balance the government.

If Bitcoin had it's own NBitA, it would be in a much better position to defend itself than a bunch of individual users.


>A mining network that anyone can contribute to would enable Bitcoin to stay alive in spite of this

Again. Start building an alt-coin with ASIC-resistant algorithm then, it's much more important than the small blocks in your model.

And it must also have other features to support your fight: integrated darkcoin-style anonymity, only TOR as the protocol, etc.

Trying to use Bitcoin, which is overly-exposed, for this kind of fight is a pretty dumb idea.

You won't have the benefits of a small attack surface and you won't have the benefits of strength - the most vulnerable position.

Not to mention that many people simply don't share your vision of Bitcoin as a marginalized outlawed coin somewhere in the depths of TOR.

Looking at how enthusiastically people in smallblockistan promote the most vulnerable position, I'd say they are all agents of USG.
