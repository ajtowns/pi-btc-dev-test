Yes this works too.

However is it dependent on the bitcoin client address generation algorithm?

I think what I'm trying to describe is something more akin to the way a
shared secret is generated by TLS.

Agree, that the wallet is also shared, ive not yet worked out a way to
'blind' one side of the wallet, but nor have a proved it's impossible, so
still working onthat :)

Perhaps I've not described the problem statement as clearly as I could,
I'll work on it.  Essentially it's an automated way to bootstrap the RSA
key community together with bitcoin.  e.g. 99% of GPG users probably dont
have a bitcion wallet or address or client.  I think maybe a user story
will help.

Not snarky at all!  Appreciate the feedback...
