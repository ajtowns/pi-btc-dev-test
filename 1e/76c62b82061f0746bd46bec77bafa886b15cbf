That's a good idea. What about using GitHub's Wiki feature for BIPs?
They support MarkDown which is easy to read in text editors so we could
someday create a repo with all finalized BIPs. That's a lot easier than
importing a mediawiki dump. The last time en.bitcoin.it went down I
tried to setup a static mirror and that was nearly impossible without a
full LAMP stack. Also, BIPs should only contain images when absolutely
necessary.
