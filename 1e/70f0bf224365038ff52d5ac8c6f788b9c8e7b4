Yeah. I am still unsure that this really holds. Bitcoin moves fast,
but even so, unless there are a few more SatoshiDice-like events and
the way people use transactions changes dramatically we're a long way
from gigabyte sized blocks.  And once we get there, technology will
probably have improved to the point where it doesn't seem like a big
deal anymore.

Of course we have debated this many times already. Maybe again at the
next meetup :-)
