I think that statement is too weak. Users are all personally responsible
for evaluating all rules for themselves. Many have chosen and will continue
to choose to just keep an ear out for rule changes that they may be
interested in using. Ever user should be educated on this topic...
otherwise there are too many principal agent problems, even with the
ability to "fire" developers (a.k.a "use different software"). It's similar
to the reasons why it's important to see all the transactions on the
network.
