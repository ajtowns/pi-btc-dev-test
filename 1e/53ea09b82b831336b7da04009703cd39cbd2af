The discount is designed to reduce UTXO bloat primarily, witness spam
data would not make it into the UTXO set. The discount brings the fee
of a transaction more in line with the actual costs to the network for
the transaction. A miner spamming the network with 4MB witness blocks
would have very little impact on the UTXO size compared with 1MB
non-witness blocks. UTXO size is a bigger issue than blockchain size
since full nodes can't prune the UTXO set.

The discount of 75% for the SegWit softfork doesn't really have any
effect on future hard forks as it can always be adjusted as needed
later on as part of a HF.
