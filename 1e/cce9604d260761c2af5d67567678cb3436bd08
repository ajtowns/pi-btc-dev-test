Browser extension would only be required until browsers add native support
for detecting the tag and prompting a wallet client. This probably won't
happen in the near future, though.

Also, the kind of browser extension you're talking about would be limited
to just one device or require manually configured syncing between your
devices, and would also likely be limited to just a few platforms.

The communication is done between the wallet and merchant the same as
always with BIP70, but with some extra BIP70 extensions for this purpose.
It just starts talking earlier.

It supports graceful degradation just fine, if the browser or wallet don't
support it or the wallet isn't linked to that computer's browser, then
nothing out of the ordinary happens. The browser extension really don't do
anything special, it just relays the details in the HTML tag.

It isn't necessarily top secret, but why not be protective by default? Your
hardware wallet is already designed to keep secrets. Lets say you're at a
library computer, or at a friend's house, why not let your hardware wallet
deal with all the security?

In this scenario it is likely already functioning as a central point for
all your Bitcoin related purchases anyway, so it might as well be the
device that remembers all your shopping preferences for you. So let's make
it simple to use!
