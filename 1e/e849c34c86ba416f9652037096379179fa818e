I am sure the failure here is probably more mundane like a a service not
restarted, or not on auto restart when server is rebooted and such like.
The dns seeder works pretty efficiently in my experience. Maybe we need
more seeders and to include the ability for zone transfers so existing
seeders can spread their records to multiple servers running standard DNS
servers like bind etc.
