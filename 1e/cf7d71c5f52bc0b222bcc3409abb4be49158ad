Right, so Freimarkets is delibrately insecure.

Best of luck on that.

Read my paper? - proof-of-publication is what allows you to detect
front-running robustly within certain parameters. Protecting against
that is widely considered to be a very important goal by people actually

anti-front-running protection might be the *only* thing they use a
decentralized system for.
