Well it's a finite code base so yes, it should be possible.

The only problem is .... so far everyone who tried it, didn't succeed :)
Heck even people who tried to reimplement it by reading the code keep
getting subtle details wrong.

So it should definitely be possible one day, assuming Bitcoin doesn't
become radically more complex, but it's a minefield.
