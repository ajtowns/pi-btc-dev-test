By magic I meant that that it happens all by itself without any extra
configuring.

Thank you for your responses. I have been enlightened. As ZmnSCPxj has
pointed out lightning network and pruning accomplishes everything I set out
to accomplish. And sharding is exactly what I had in mind. I will keep this
in the back of my mind and perhaps even attempt will implement it if it
still seems worth doing later.

You guys are totally awesome!!!

I here by withdraw my proposal for the time being.
