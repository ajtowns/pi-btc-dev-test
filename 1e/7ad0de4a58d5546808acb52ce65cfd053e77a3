Godaddy and many other CA's are verified from nothing other than a
http fetch, no email involved.

As I said, I'm willing to demonstrate if you have a domain.

You can, once you've obtained a certificate.

As I warned before, you're making my reconsider my position about the
downloads being SSL. If people are so convinced that SSL provides
protection it does not that even with an explanation and and an offer
to demonstrate then perhaps providing SSL will reduce people's
security.

... the _only_ reason I don't yet hold that position now is that I
know objectively that almost no one tests the signatures.

My understanding is that the domain is already controlled by more than
one person. You're not the first person to think of these things. :)
