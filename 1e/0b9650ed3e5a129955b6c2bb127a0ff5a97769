Nelson,

Talking politics, Devs do day and night, however politics is also about
knocking on door and not sitting behind a keyboard writing a perl script to
spam the politicians with the same content. Politics is about maneuvering
to be in a position to get the elected official to do what you want because
if he don't, you will make sure it will not get elected next time.

I personally never could finish drilling into the code (which is very
elegantly written) because some New York idiot decided that Bitcoin was too
dangerous for society to handle. I had to stop playing with the code and
turn my attention elsewhere. *You can read the opinion of one of the idiot
