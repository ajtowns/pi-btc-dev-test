Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Detailed gitian build guide
Message-ID: <CA+s+GJDJRW-ydQ-93dHLShZoWtCox=J47TGO=wwSq7Ahn0LwMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm working on a detailed guide on how to install and set up a Debian VM
for gitian building. As this guide can be used on any operating system that
has VirtualBox, hopefully this will make it easier for people to get
started with gitian builds.

See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3994

Rendered version is here:
https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin/blob/2014_04_debian_gitian_build_doc/doc/gitian-building.md

Comments and patches are welcome.
If you bump into problems while following the guide please let me know.

Wladimir
