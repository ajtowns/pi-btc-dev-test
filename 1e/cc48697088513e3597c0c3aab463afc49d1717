Running normal full nodes only provides extra service to nodes
synchronizing and lightweight clients. It does not "make the network
stronger" in the sense that it does not reduce the trust the participants
need to have in each other.

It's such a misconception that running many nodes somehow helps. It's much
better that you run and control one or a few full nodes which you actually
use to validate your transactions, than to run 1000s of nodes in third
party datacenters. The latter only looks more decentralized.
