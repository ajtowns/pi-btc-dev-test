Subject: [bitcoin-dev] [BIP Proposal] Nym Enrolment Transaction Template
Message-ID: <QFg83njQkTWwnSLd_GxcmmHaD4TmocERn8RScBz0_cEjZmnAAsrtmpQsv-kjap7Nyf0wHZndH83gVKJ8ihkvI-cZF84fKqZD781SpLFYhXo=@protonmail.com>

Hello list,

I would like to propose a draft BIP that takes the next available transaction version number and defines a new transaction template. This proposal does not have any consensus changes, and is purely for the application layer of Bitcoin. The new transaction template defines a special transaction structure that can be used as a cryptographic pseudonym.

I hope the community will find this proposal useful and will find time to give it careful review.

Here is the first BIP within our project
https://github.com/veleslavs/bips/blob/bip_nym_tx/bip-nym_tx.mediawiki

I would like to thank the entire team that has supported me in creating this proposal.

? ?????????? ???????????,
