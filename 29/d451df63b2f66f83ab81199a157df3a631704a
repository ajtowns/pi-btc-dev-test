Hi Gavin,

Did a quick compile and run (bitcoind, Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS)

Findings - compile (I do not use the UPNP feature):
in the makefile.unix I have to change the:
USE_UPNP:=0
to 
USE_UPNP:=
i.e. it is defined if it is "0" ! 

running: no apparent issues (I have never managed to trigger the deadlocks.?.)

Nice job, but a quick cleanup of interfaces and classes (one file pr class, all interfaces defined in headers) would really be nice... Would be happy to do it myself, as it would greatly enhance the flexibility of the code and be a first step towards a more library/interface like split.

Cheers,

Michael
