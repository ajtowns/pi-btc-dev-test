The rational miner works hard digging hashes out of the ether, and wants 
the reward to be great.  How much more valuable would his reward be if 
he were paid in something that is spendable like cash on a 1-minute 
network for coffee and other innumerable real-time transactions, versus 
something that is only spendable on a 15-minute network?

There is a prisoner's dilemma, to be sure, but do the fees from helping 
people successfully double-spend their coffee supplier really outweigh 
the increased value to the entire network - including himself - of 
ensuring that digital cash actually works like cash?
