I expect that I will make a lot of mistakes, and probably ask too many
questions - but I hope you can bear with me.

I've been trying to keep a low profile as I get better acquainted with the
project. I'm clearly in the company of some very smart people - and would
like to keep it that way.

I've tried to do my research on the main contributors, and it seems that
Matt is the only one to escape my Google stalking. If you have any questions
about my background - feel free to inquire.

It's difficult to ascertain what needs QA work first, so any guidance or
suggestion is appreciated. I'm available via social networks, email, phone,
fax?, IM, IRC, etc. Let me know your preference, or don't and I'll bugger
off.

I'll try to stay out of the way, and do my best to make the development
cycle easier. Let me know if I'm stepping on toes, or being annoying. I
won't be offended.

As for the commit testing, I want to have an idiot proof solution to get as
many people testing as possible (eventually). With code like this, I think
it's better to go full-auto with the ACKs.
