Comments:

1) Payment message should include ability to specify the transaction
_or_ a transaction id sent via normal means over the network.

2) I think a significant bitcoin userbase will want to operate outside
the full root-CA chain.  Just look at https:// websites now.
Self-signed certs are quite common, because it is easier, while being
more secure than http://

So some provision for self-signed certs, a use case in wide use
elsewhere, or equivalent thereof, seems reasonable.
