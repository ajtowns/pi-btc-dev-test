Thanks for the feedback Mark.

Sure, there is a good reason to include it in the blockchain: so that
clients don't need external information to recognize colored coins. Also,
I'm not sure what you mean by "not validated", in that proposal, the tagged
transaction is the authoritative source of information.

9 bytes is much less than what Mastercoin and counterparty are doing
(certainly under the 40 bytes allowed).

Yes I have seen it and find the padding quite clumsy and unintuitive. A
more general solution is the one I described in my original post, where the
color value is entirely separate from the satoshi value, and encoded
separately: if you have to have an additional "padding" value to calculate
color_value = satoshi_value - padding, you might as well have color_value
directly, independently from satoshi_value. But I don't even think it is
necessary:

An easy workaround is to have various scales, the same way you have $1
bills, $5 bills an $10 bills. I don't see that as a big problem. That way
the protocol is more lightweight and simple.

Also those 54 BTC (actually 5.4 BTC if the dust is now 540 satoshis) become
part of the capital of the company, and can always be recovered by
uncoloring the shares. It's an investment, not an expense, so I think it is
acceptable.

Best,
Flavien
