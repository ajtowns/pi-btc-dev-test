I'd file this under premature optimization at the cost of
interoperability. If you use JSON, then please use it properly.

I'd also say it's the job of the parser to offer a way of doing that,
e.g. in .NET you can easily achieve that with Newtonsoft's JSON
parser: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20374083/deserialize-json-array-stream-one-item-at-a-time.
