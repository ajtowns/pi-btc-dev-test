Could every node do the resends? Alternatively, could we implement a TOR
like tunneling system just for the first leg of the transactions
(overkill?). Then again, maybe just a TOR gateway if that's desired.

This is a nice idea but sounds rather unreliable.

There's already an implementation of this, called UTP. If we do decide
that using UDP is worthwhile, this library is probably better than
implementing something ourselves.
