This is interesting, but I suppose some miners may have business models
that can't be easily summed up as a "fee" - like all-you-can-eat deals with
certain providers, or preference to certain kinds of transactions etc.

For the concern that estimation might force fees down too far if miners
include private transactions, I thought the estimates were calculated only
on broadcast transactions, so transactions that just appear in a block
won't ever influence the estimate?
