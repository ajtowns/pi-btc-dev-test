The only part that has an x509 cert associated is in the invoice message.

message Invoice {
//    repeated bytes x509chain = 1;
    optional string domainName =1;
    repeated Output outputs = 2;
    required uint64 time = 3;
    optional uint64 expires = 4;
    optional bool single_use = 5 [default = true];
    optional string memo = 6;
    optional string receiptURI = 7;
    optional bytes merchant_data = 8;
}

Removing that and adding a opaque string called domain name, or
identityName would be sufficient to move the conversation forward
without the x.509 baggage.
