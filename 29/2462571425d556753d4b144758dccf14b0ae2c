It's an optimisation problem. Home environments are much more hostile than
servers are due to things like virus scanners, wildly varying memory
pressure as apps are started and shut down, highly asymmetrical upstream
versus downstream bandwidth,  complicated nat setups, people who only use
laptops (which I think is most people these days) and so on.

So I think the right way to go is to optimise the things that hurt server
node operators like large memory and disk  usage, and this will
automatically make it more pleasant to run on the desktop as well. If at
some point all the low hanging fruit for the server side is gone then
improving things on the desktop would be the next place to go. But we have
to be realistic. Desktop tower machines that are always on are dying and
will not be coming back. Not a single person I know uses them anymore, they
have been wiped out in favour of laptops. This is why, given the tiny size
of the bitcoin core development team, I do not think it makes sense to
spend precious coding hours chasing this goal.
