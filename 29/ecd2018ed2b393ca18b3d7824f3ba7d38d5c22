Point taken.

About the sub_version_num though. I prefer to let the field by defined clients however they wish, with just a guideline suggestion that IDENTIFIER VERSION is a format they should follow.

The idea being that different projects would have different release scheduling schemes and it'd be restrictive to lock people into the popular major.minor system.

So for the current bitcoin to find out the version number of other clients (if it was needed), it would have to parse the number from the string:

"Satoshi 0.5"

Although there would be little reason for this with a sane protocol versioning scheme.

If we're agreed then I'll start on that BIP.

Good idea.

Sounds perfect for a BIP....
