This is excellent.

One additional URL makes this pretty much perfect:

  GET /rest/block-with-tx/TX-HASH

Construction of the transaction-hash-to-block database is something the full 
client's have to do anyway, so this query is no harder than the others for 
them to supply; but suddenly makes it possible for an SPV client to trace the 
providence of any transaction without needing to maintain the entire chain.
