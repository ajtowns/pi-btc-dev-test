It does; it is still a draft. That said I think writing up some actual working examples, in code, of CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY using protocols is a bigger priority. Micropayment channels comes to mind, as well as a greenaddress-style wallet.

When I get a chance I'm going to rebase the initial implementation and add to it a command-line-flag to verify CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY as an IsStandard() rule for testing purposes.
