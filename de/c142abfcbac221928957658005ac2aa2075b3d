My only comment is that it should be called escheatment, not demurrage ;)

It's relation to demurrage is only that it might be desirable to garbage
collect decayed bit-dust. We looked at it early-on in the Freicoin
development, but rejected it as a possibility due to reasons others have
mentioned, even though we were starting from a hard-fork position.
