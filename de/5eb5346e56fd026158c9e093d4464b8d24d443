Er, no?  if a node controls the private keys for a transaction, and
that transaction makes it into the chain then it can safely assume
that its unspent (at least once its buried a few blocks into the
chain).  This is the essence of a SPV node.

What it can't do is perform this function for txn which aren't its
own. Though the system could be extended in a compatible manner to
make this possible: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=21995.0
