How do we know if a committed UTXO set is valid? If a majority of the
hashing power is willing to extend an invalid branch, it's reasonable to
assume they'd be willing to commit an invalid UTXO set as well.

In order for the committed UTXO set to be reliable at a minimum it will
need to contain at a source block reference for each item in the set.
That would enable fraud proof to show that the committed UTXO set
contains invalid entries.

I agree the information should be an extra commitment produced by the
miner, rather than changing the format of the transaction, since the
author of a transaction can't always know the required information ahead
of time.

If items in the the proof tree are required to be sorted, then it's easy
to proof that an item is missing.
