Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin-qt ready for merging
Message-ID: <CAL0fb61HrL8xe0yNG8_H0cEmVizzhg1pRe67aJmUPbGmLabYcA@mail.gmail.com>

Can you please submit a pull request and testing plan? If these already
exist, can you please link them here?

I'm exciting to get this in, as it will close the wx issues. (and hopefully
not bring on too many qt issues)

Thanks,
Alex
