Ultimately the only way to insure bitcoin holdings is with an insurer
who themselves holds enough bitcoin to cover replacement of insured
funds. In the existing insurance industry, this is handled through a
system of re-insurance, where smaller firms are themselves insured
against catastrophic events that might cause a large number of
simultaneous claims. At the top of the chain sits super-cat insurance
firms like Berkshire Hathaway who do actually have the reserves to pay
out in case of such a super catastrophy. This is one of the most
lucrative businesses in the world, and one that today's very large
bitcoin holders will find themselves uniquely positioned to engage in
as bitcoin grows into a major global currency.
