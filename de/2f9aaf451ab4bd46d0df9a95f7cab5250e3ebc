The default maximum amount of connections is 125, which only happens if you
have a stable node that accepts incoming connections. The maximum number of
outgoing connections is always 8.
Should be no problem even for cheapass routers.

Adding throttling wouldn't be horribly hard, but this is postponed until
parallel block download is implemented, so that other peers will not get
stuck on your throttled node.

There is enough lower-hanging fruit left.

If you're interested in speeding up the performance I think it's important
to start with benchmarking and analysis to find out where the pain points
are.
