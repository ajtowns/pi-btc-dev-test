Oops, hit send too early.

The other nice thing about this approach, besides being stateless on the
server side, is that it's up to the client whether or not they present the
cookie. So the node can say "if you don't present your cookie I'm going to
disconnect you" but when the node has sufficient resources, it'd just not
request this and the client remains anonymous. If the client thinks the
server is calling its bluff, it can just wait and see if it really does get
disconnected and if so, present the cookie up front next time.
