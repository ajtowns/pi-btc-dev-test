It is correct that security is slightly reduced for full nodes that have
not upgraded.  It is not correct that the choice is binary, full node or
SPV.

Any user running a not-upgraded full node still retains protection against
many attacks outside the subset related to the feature being introduced.

The field observable end result is that we do receive new features, secured
by hashpower and user full nodes, via soft fork, without a global flag day
upgrade.

Yes, a flag day hard fork upgrade is cleaner and results in higher security
due to the entire network validating the new rules.  However, the
difficulty of executing hard forks would mean fewer total features to
users, if that route were chosen instead.
