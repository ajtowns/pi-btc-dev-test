The modifications to Bitcoin Core would take at most a day to do, plus a week 
to test.
I?m not very happy with the full compromise myself, but can we please not 
stomp on actual progress with nebulous problems?
I mean, you want SegWit, right?

The nature of a compromise like the one that happened in New York is that 
both parties do something they are not the most happy with in exchange for 
the thing they want.
Miners have agreed to the SegWit part of this compromise. Calling that 
disingenuous is not helpful...
