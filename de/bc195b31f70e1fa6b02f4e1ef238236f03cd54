On naming, please allow consideration of "Confidential address".
Less conflation with "private key", connotes confidence, and as the address is known to the transacting parties, it is a precisely accurate name.
 
One of the use cases for these will be in multinational corporate internal international settlement.  For a company to use bitcoin for its internal settlement and maintain confidence that competitors will not be able to suss out its transactions, these confidential addresses will be of great use.
 
 
Stealth connotes stealing, theft, hiding, fear, sneakiness, stealth bombers.  Maybe it is a good name, but not the best name.
