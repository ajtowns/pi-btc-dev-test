I meant running a seed yourself. Note that I've only received funds to cover expenses and a trivial amount on top to cover some time - about one and a half hours at my usual rates.

Gavin: Speaking of, given it looks like my work will be frequently keeping me out of country and unable to provide any more than a "best effort" attempt at running a seed, I'd like to give back the grant funds for doing so. Email me privately with an address to send them too. I have no plans to take it down, however the expectations users have for it aren't something I can provide.

I checked via the same proxy both times; I believe the endpoint is located in Europe.
