A big yuck on that format. It should be something based on a patricia trie
to support incremental updates. Also if the things being stored are output
transaction + output number then those two can be hashed together to make a
consistent size identifier and be put into the merkle set format I
proposed, which is exactly the intended usage:

If it's of that order it should be synched up with the work difficulty
reset interval of 2016. If the format supports incremental updates it would
of course be possible to require them more frequently later.

With a patricia based format it would be possible to make much more common
utxo commitments, possibly as often as every block only trailing by a few,
and the cost of updating wouldn't be onerous and reorgs could be handled by
simply undoing the last few transactions in the set and and then rolling
forward.
