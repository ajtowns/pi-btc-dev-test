Sorry! the item duplication was due to the pull. (very stupid me)

The issue with account "" remains.

For coinbase transactions, we may list one "generated" item per txout
that corresponds to an owned address. Accounts would be associated
accordingly, in the same way as for usual "received" amounts. Account
balances would also take into account these generated amounts in the
obvious way.

Would that be ok? I think few people rely on these specific details,
and they would be happy with such a change. Moreover, this would
actually simplify the code a little bit.
