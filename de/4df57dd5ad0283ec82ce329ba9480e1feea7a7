That's not what I was suggesting. My point is that the ledger was never
edited. An 'irregular state change' was added at a specific block height,
but the ledger remains inviolate.

I'm sure I don't have to explain the difference between the ledger and the
state to you, or why it's significant that the ledger wasn't (and can't be,
practically) modified.
