As per Gavin at the top of the thread, the intent is to give the customer
reassurance that their payment will be processed. The merchant trying to
get the tx confirmed is presumably a part of that as it'd make no sense for
a merchant to give that assurance and decide they don't care about the
money.

But nothing stops the user broadcasting the tx as well, once the receiver
has given that assurance.
