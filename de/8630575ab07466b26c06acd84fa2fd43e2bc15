A couple more thoughts on this:

1) Both c and k can be kept if c is pronounced 'ch', giving ~10.9 bits per
phoneme.
2) An extra phoneme (4 encode 43 bits total) gives room to put extra
information into the name, e.g. the first 5 bits could be input as the key
to a PRP that permutes the last 38 back to a standard encoding of a tx
location.  This would give the user 32 random names per sacrifice to choose
from, and 38 bits to encode its location in the blockchain, which is enough
for pretty large blocks.

Sample 4 phoneme names:
~milmoz-vyrnyx
~mypnoz-fojzas
~sawfex-bovlec
~fidhut-guvgis
~bobfej-jessuk
~furcos-diwhuw
~wokryx-wilrox
~bygbyl-caggos
~vewcyv-jyjsal
~daxsaf-cywkul

They're not that bad IMHO, especially if you get to pick a decent one from
a bunch.
