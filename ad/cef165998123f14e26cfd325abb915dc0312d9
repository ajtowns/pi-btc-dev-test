Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP75 Update - August 31, 2016
Message-ID: <CAH+Axy7F1Up0nQwZdmUp+5Lo9PF065AHK0uJjwcFnic9vrSVyA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Today we are submitting some updates to BIP75:

-- Example use cases have been reworded to more accurately describe the
goal of this BIP and how the technology works.
-- ECDSA and PGP have been added to the supported public key infrastructure
(PKI) types to increase flexibility and use cases.
-- Versioning has been added to make future changes and backwards
compatibility easy to manage.
-- Other minor, technical details have been added or changed to improve
performance and reduce ambiguity during implementation.

You can see the PR here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/439

Thank you,
James
