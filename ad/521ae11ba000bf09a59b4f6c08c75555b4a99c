I've been trying to move discussions to this mailing list, by starting
conversations here and posting links to the mailing list archives in the
discussion forums just so people know there is a conversation going on.

IRC conversations are great for rapid back-and-forth brainstorming, so I
expect a lot of work to continue getting done via IRC, but once there's
general consensus there I expect issues to migrate here.
