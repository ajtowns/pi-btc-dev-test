Either one branch wins overwhelmingly in a relatively short period of time?or both branches lose, I think.

The best answer is that they are incentivized to not override a minority group since that reduces the inherent value in the system. However, presuming that the majority calculate that the reward for imposing a change is greater than the value lost in such disruption, I don't see how there would be any stopping this change. The longest chain with the greatest number of users valuing the token on that chain "wins".
