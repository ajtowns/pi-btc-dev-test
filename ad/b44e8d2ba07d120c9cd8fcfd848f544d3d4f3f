This particular technicality is rather important since it removes the basis of 
your argument.
More specifically, your 4 points of what you claim Satoshi expected to happen, 
but didn't were in actual fact not planned, wanted or predicted by Satoshi.

So, you can do name calling if you want, but maybe thats not very productive.

This is an odd statement, we keep on hearing about low bitcoin-core node count 
and since that is the only alternative, your statement can only be interpreted 
as saying there really are not a whole lot of users out there..
Is that really what you mean?

What is the point you are trying to make with that?  It seems completely 
irrelevant to the point of this thread...
