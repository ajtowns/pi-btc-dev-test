Luke, if you think that the sole purpose of a URI scheme is to be used as a
URI handler, I think you've not fully understood the concept.  URIs are the
global variable of the internet, and as such the need to play nicely with
all other URI schemes on the net.  They need to be able to be linked to, to
be defined and documented.  This is important for bitcoin to get right
because bitcoin: needs to treated in a special way on the internet, I just
saw today that it was treated by some software as a relative URL, which is
going to break a ton of stuff.

I am opposed to address changes in general, until he wider implications are
fully understood.
