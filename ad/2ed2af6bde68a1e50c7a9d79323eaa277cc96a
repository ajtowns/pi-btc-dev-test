I think BIP 70 does a good job at verifying where the payment request came from.  I?m not convinced this is the same as verifying the transaction (ideally OOB).

The reason for OOB verification is if the entire computer is compromised.  Again, this may only be possible with a trusted intermediary or a web wallet.
