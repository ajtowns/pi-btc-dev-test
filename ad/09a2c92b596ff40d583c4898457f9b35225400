Hi Tristan,

Regarding the "Post-Quantum Address Recovery" part (I haven't read the
other parts), you may be interested in my message to the list from last
month and the rest of the thread:
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-January/015659.html

This is an approach which aims to avoid the issues that you've
mentioned in your blog post.

Best,
Tim
