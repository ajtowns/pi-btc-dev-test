There is another interesting analysis on BMM and drivechains from /u/almkglor
on reddit
<https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ztp3b/lets_discuss_something_techrelated_for_a_change/dn0rsdo/>.
I'm going to share here for visibility.

The problem with drivechains and blind merged mining is the disconnect

>    1. Not accept BMM, not vote.
>    2. Not accept BMM, operate their own sidechain node, mine sidecoin,

>    5. Accept BMM, not vote.

TLDR: a miner is most profitable if he always accepts BMM bribes, but
downvotes withdrawal transactions (WT). This obviously isn't ideal because
a withdrawal will never occur from the drivechain if enough miners employ
this strategy -- which seems to be the most profitable strategy.
