Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Incentivising full nodes by having SPV nodes to
 pay for data requests

The typical interpretation of the "tragedy of the commons" scenario is
based on the presumption that a limited resource is controlled by the state.

In a free market there is no such idea, a limited resource becomes
property and is therefore allocated by customer preference and
maintained by self-interest.

Validation is not a resource controlled by the state, which is of course
the point of Bitcoin.

It is inaccurate to think of Bitcoin validation a limited resource. The
scenario in which fewer people validate does not reduce the amount of
validation available. It increases the risk of loss to those who fail to
validate. The gain to those who do validate comes from avoiding that loss.
