What a coincidence. I do have observed the same thing. right now with
0.8.5. I am writing a small app. My jsonrpc client is programmed to
timeout after 2 secs and I did see a couple of timeouts once in while.

What I did is a simple test app that just hammer bitcoind with 3 rpc
requests every 30 seconds and I abort it as soon as it encountered a
timeout.

The 3 request burst is performed on the same HTTP 1.1 kept alive
connection. Then I disconnect. When I launch my app before leaving in
the morning, pretty sure that I have a core dump waiting for me when I
come back.

I choose very simple calls: getinfo,getaccount

Added a couple of traces in the RPC handling code. (BTW, timestamps in
traces would be tremendously useful for tracking problems...). I see my
request received by bitcoind but there is no trace yet to show that the
reply is sent.

Not sure yet exactly where the problem is but my current #1 suspect is:

LOCK2(cs_main, pwalletMain->cs_wallet);

with some kind of lock contention with the other threads.
