Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP- & SLIP-0039 -- better multi-language support
Message-ID: <bANNM0nNJ1cJdrNjvBZfx6O-zwAQ_bg4qPgoYCQGGNQxc0I4AHF0nQCqPYGqYQzLMP07URApaPCOBBPC4whZ77M8amvUdfIo3TFhQjpzNpY=@protonmail.com>

Do you specifically want to support changing the language of seed
words, while keeping the bip32 root seed they generate unchanged?
What is the usecase for this?

You mention that BIP39 already supports a few different languages.
While this is true, many (I would guess most!) wallets only
support the English wordlist.
There are doubts even from the authors of the BIP whether it was
a good idea in the first place to support multiple languages [0].
I don't find this surprising as it seems bad design to have to fix and
maintain a wordlist for every language as the checksum depends on it.
The supported wordlists are effectively a part of the specification,
and every new list would just make that specification larger.

If changing the language of seeds is not a requirement, then look
into Electrum seeds. They are language/wordlist agnostic.

Mnemonic Sentence => PBKDF2 => BIP-0032 Seed

The bip32 seed is derived by hashing the normalized mnemonic, and the
checksum is derived the same way but by using a different cheaper
hash (single round of HMAC-SHA512; generation grinds until it matches
a pattern) [1]. For example, "9dk" is a valid segwit electrum seed.
