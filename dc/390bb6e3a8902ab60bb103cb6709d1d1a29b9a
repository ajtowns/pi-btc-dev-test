Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Pull 748 pay to script hash

I'm reading a diff of a now defunct OP_EVAL proposal with the current pay to script hash one.

It might be better for code review if the old pull is reverted and then this one re-requested. That will make it easier to see the real changes.
