There is always a process.  Right now the process is haphazard, unclear, 
and constantly changing without being written down so people don't 
actually know what it is.  In fact you do not all have a reasonable 
understanding of "technical consensus" because if you did then you could 
write it down ... but you can't.   The current process is being gamed by 
people making tweets, reddit posts, videos, and blog posts.  A more 
formalized process would channel that activity into a a more usable format.

This kind of thing always happens as projects become larger and more 
diverse.  Something that was once a small group turns into a big group 
of diverse stakeholders.  When it gets too big for the informal 
processes then some people get upset and defensive. Happens all the time 
but it is not really a good excuse to keep doing things in an 
inefficient manner.  The old ways just don't scale and if you ever 
worked on massive projects then you know these formal processes work better.
