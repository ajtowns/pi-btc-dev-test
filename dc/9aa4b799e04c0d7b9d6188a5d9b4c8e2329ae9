Actually, we'll probably need to explicitly document that a failure to
reject is by no means a promise to forward.

If a node is using priority queued rate limiting for its relaying then
it might "accept" a transaction from you, but have it fall out of its
memory pool (due to higher priority txn arriving, or getting
restarted, etc.) before it ever gets a chance to send it on to any
other peers.

Finding out that it rejected is still useful information, but even
assuming all nodes are honest and well behaved I don't think you could
count on its absence to be sure of forwarding.
