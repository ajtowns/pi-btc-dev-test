Coincidentally I had thought of something similar to what Kalle posted
about a kind of software only time-lock vault, and described the idea
to a few people off-list.  Re. Root incompatibility, if the key is
deleted (as it must be) then a delegated signature can not be made
that bypasses the CSV timeout restriction, so Root should not be
incompatible with this.  I think it would be disadvantageous to mark
keys as Rootable vs not in a sighash sense, because then that is
another privacy/fungibility loss eroding  the uniformity advantage of
Root when the delegate is not used.

One drawback is deleting keys may itself be a bit difficult to assure
with HD wallet seeds setup-time backup model.

As Anthony described I think, a simpler though less robust model would
be to have a third party refuse to co-sign until a pre-arranged time,
and this would have the advantage of not requiring two on-chain
transactions.

With bulletproofs and CT rangeproofs / general ECDL ZKPS there is the
possibility to prove things about the private key, or hidden
attributes of a public key in zero-knowledge.  Kind of what we want is
to place private key covenants, where we have to prove that they are
met without disclosing them.  For example there is a hidden CSV and it
is met OR there is no hidden CSV so it is not applicable.
