Being an early hub provider would be an obvious place to start capitalizing
on lightning. Early lightning adopters would be in the best position to do
this.

Long term, Bitcoin needs to scale the blockchain in a reasonable manner and
implement things like lightning.

Limiting the blocksize is a blatant conflict of interest because it creates
artificial demand for lightning that would not otherwise exist if the
blockchain scaled in a reasonable manner.
