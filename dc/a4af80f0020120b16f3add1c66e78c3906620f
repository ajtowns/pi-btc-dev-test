Moving the list to BCC, since this isn't really a technical discussion.

I get the feeling we might be reasoning from different underlying
assumptions, but I don't think you can separate value that way. Those
fundamental properties were chosen to serve the goal of creating a digital
commodity money. They are useful only in as much as they serve ends that
people value. Consensus, security, censorship resistance are valuable
because they are desirable properties for money to have.

If you want to argue that the properties of bitcoin are valuable for other
things besides money, that's fine, but those other uses presumably can be
accomplished with tiny amounts of bitcoin, so don't appreciably increase
demand.

I think it depends on what you mean by "adoption". Adoption as a
store-of-value must necessarily increase the market price given the
restricted and eventually fixed supply. If we're talking about merchant
adoption as a payment system, or increased transaction volume, the yes,
these things have no direct impact on the price. They only impact the price
indirectly in as much as they encourage further adoption as a
store-of-value.

Increased adoption does strengthen the fundamentals. The most important
fundamental for money is how many other people standardize on the same
money, and want to hold it. This drives it's price in terms of other
commodities. You want to hold what everyone else wants to hold.
