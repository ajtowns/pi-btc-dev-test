I do, but it's currently not in shippable form. Would the encoding / decoding functions suffice?

Jean-Paul,

Very interesting. I have a beta BIP0038 compliant paper wallet and I'm working on BIP0032 paper wallets at the moment. 

This is definitely necessary and a great approach to combine BIP0038 and BIP0032. 

Do you have reference code?
