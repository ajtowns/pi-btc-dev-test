It's extremely naive to think that just because you can't think of an
incentive for a reason for an attack to do this, an attacker will never
to do this. There are many people that would be willing to spend some
time to cause some trouble for the enjoyment of it, if the attack is
free to execute.

The fact that it takes very little time and effort to prevent a BIP from
reaching final status, means that in an base of millions of users it's
guaranteed that some disgruntled or bored person out there will attack
it, even if it's for the lulz.

To reasonably expect that any hark fork - including an uncontroversial
one - will be adapted by every single person in a ecosystem of millions
of people, is wishful thinking and the BIP may as well say "hard fork
BIPs shall never reach final status."
