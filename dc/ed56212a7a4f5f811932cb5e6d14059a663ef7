These issues all stem from the RC4-based RNG implementation (with insecure
fallback entropy) in Tom Wu's jsbn library, published here:
http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/

Please refer to Tom Wu's URL, or this more up-to-date fork of Tom Wu's code
(published to NPM): https://github.com/andyperlitch/jsbn -- my repository on
GitHub was only ever intended to be a straight mirror of Tom Wu's code (created
over 7 years ago!).  I'll probably delete my mirror repository given that there
are now better JavaScript bignum alternatives, and in light of this report.
