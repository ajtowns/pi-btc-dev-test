Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Weekly developer meetings over holidays
Message-ID: <20151222155845.GA23900@amethyst.visucore.com>


Next two weekly developer meetings would fall on:

- Thursday December 24th
- Thursday December 31th

In my timezone they're xmas eve and new year's eve respectively, so at least I
won't be there, and I'm sure they're inconvenient for most people.

So: let's have a two week hiatus, and continue January 7th.
