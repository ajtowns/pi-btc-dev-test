The original question is intended to answer both: a) why only one 
implementation is insufficient for Final status, and b) why two is sufficient.

If every application had its own BIP (how I understand your version), none of 
them would be standards and it wouldn't make sense to have a BIP at all - just 
project documentation would be sufficient.

Extending this to "influence" is probably too far - after all, comments may 
discourage implementations, which can very well result in the Status 
eventually becoming Rejected rather than Final. How about:

"To avoid doubt: comments and status are intended to be unrelated metrics. In 
other words, a BIP having the status 'Rejected' is no reason to write (or not 
write) additional comments about it, nor would a status of 'Final' preclude 
comments discouraging [further] implementation. Likewise, overwhelming support 
for a BIP in its comments section doesn't change the requirements for the 
'Final' or 'Active' status."

Hmm, I wonder if this could be too easily abuse to discourage comments 
(because the commenter does not wish to register with yet another forum), 
and/or censor negative comments (because the author has made his own forum 
specifically for the purpose).

I have integrated this into the draft.

The intent is for the commenter to edit the wiki page himself. I have updated 
it to reflect this.
