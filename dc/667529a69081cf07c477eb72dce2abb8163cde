Bitcoin-Qt on master does send it now although it doesn't affect anything,
but as old pre-filtering versions will continue to exist, you'll always
have to be able to deserialize version messages without it.

Bitcoin version messages have always had variable length, look at how the
code is written in main.cpp. If you didn't experience issues until now all
it means is that no sufficiently old nodes were talking to yours.

The standard does not say it should appear. Read it again - BIP 37 says
about the new version message field:
If false then broadcast transactions will not be announced until a
filter{load,add,clear} command is received. *If missing or true*, no change
in protocol behaviour occurs.
