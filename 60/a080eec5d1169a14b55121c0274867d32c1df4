A big one is the privacy is way too good: every DNS request goes through multiple levels of caching and indirection, so there's no way to figure out who made the request to subject them additional targeting.

A connection-oriented protocol gets rid of all those protections, giving us seed operators monetisation opportunities like selling usage statistics, per-client targeted results, etc. We recently got rid of all the "call-home" functionality that previously gave this type of insight; a connecyion-oriented seed protocol gives us this right back.

There's also this pesky problem of ISP's censoring DNS results with dumb automated systems to block malware - easily fixed with Gregory Maxwell's suggestion of permuting the results with XOR - but that kind of end-user driven solution really misses out in the needs of other Bitcoin stakeholders like law enforcement and marketing companies.
