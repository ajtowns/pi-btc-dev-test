But again, how does having a longer fallow period make this any safer?
As was mentioned before, a lot of the wallets listed as WIP have code
ready and tested, just not officially released, so not listed as ready.
It doesn't take 2 months to roll out a software update that is already
prepared beforehand.

I think it's rather odd that no major Bitcoin companies have raised any
such issues with Segwit and in fact many already have the upgrade in the
works. I think it's rather odd that individuals who are not opposed to
segwit would choose to not upgrade even though it has been actively
discussed for the past year.

While flaws can still be found, unlike the DAO, Segwit has been tested
extensively for a much longer period of time. Waiting any longer isn't
likely to help given that so much testing and review has already been
done. Even so, that is a pointless argument as it is impossible to know
whether waiting a little longer would reveal an issue.

Really? How so? It's been active on 4 different segwit specific testnets
and it has been active on the Testnet for the past several months.
People have been spamming segwit transactions and extensively testing
Segwit since its deployment on Testnet. I think we know how segwit
transactions and all aspects of the changes work together as it has been
tested as such for several months now.
