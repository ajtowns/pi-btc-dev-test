Dear All

I'm not sure this is welcome here. Someone suggested I let the devs
know about it here. I've made an open forum on which to post
discussion about cryptocurrency related research:
www.opencryptocurrencyreview.com

Jeff helped me with the naming a bit some time ago. It's not had much
attention but then I've not advertised it much.

Please check it out and let me know if something like this is
worthwhile in this community. I'm not aware of much of the research
myself but a central repo of it seemed lacking and this adds
discussion capabilities to the repo.

If you guys have any potential use case for this, please consider
holding some of your discussions about research that interests you
here. If it gets core devs talking on it (if it's actually useful to
you that is), then I'm sure that others will be inspired to use it.
Even just one discussion thread will help if this regard.

It's not for profit so I'm not trying to make any money out of you.
It's just an experiment.

Kind regards
Daniel Murrell
