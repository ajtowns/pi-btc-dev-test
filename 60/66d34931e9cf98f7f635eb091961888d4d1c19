That case would be stronger when there is no more subsidy, but we
collectively the uses of Bitcoin are currently paying miners around
$130k USD per block in the form of inflation for the job of honestly
complying with the Bitcoin protocol.

I don't think you can argue that they have any more right to do that
than any of us have a right to run software that invalidates their
coinbase outputs when they do; which would be the sort of retaliation
they might get targeted with.
