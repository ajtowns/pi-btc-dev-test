I assume we can't enforce to miners rules about which tx will go in and 
which won't and therefore whether this will cause more or less double 
spends.


I mean, you can try but I would rather have to option to pick an third party 
instant provider explicitly than  enforce bigger rules on mining which would 
IMHO lead to implicit centralization.
