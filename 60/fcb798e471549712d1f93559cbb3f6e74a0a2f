Its more of a statement of "in the future, we expect things to happen
which would make this an interesting thing to do, so we state here that
it is not against spec to do so". Could reword it as "NODE_BLOOM is
distinct from NODE_NETWORK, and it is legal to advertise NODE_BLOOM but
not NODE_NETWORK (though there is little reason to do so now, some
proposals may make this more useful in the future)"?
