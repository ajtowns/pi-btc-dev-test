I can confirm this seems to work quite well now. I tried running an
IPv6-only node a few days ago, and with the default seeds it couldn't
start up and sync with the network unless I manually created a dual-net
node and manually added it. Now things work just fine out of the box and
last I checked I had 5 peers.
