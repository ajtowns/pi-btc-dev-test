The same is true of the multiple private keys involved in a multi-signature addresses.

I proposed a share encoding scheme for exactly this purpose.

I intentionally omitted the parameter M (minimum subset size) from the shares because including it would give an adversary a vital piece of information. Likewise, including any kind of information that would allow a determination of whether the secret has been correctly reconstituted would give an adversary too much information. Failing silently when given incorrect shares or an insufficient number of shares is intentional.

Does it make any difference which coefficient holds the secret? It's convenient to put it in the lowest-order coefficient to simply the recovery code.

My BIP likewise deterministically chooses the coefficients so that the shares of a secret are consistent across all runs of the algorithm having the same M. As I'm sure you're aware, N (the number of shares to output) plays no part in the calculation and merely controls how many times the outermost loop is executed. My BIP doesn't even mention this parameter.
