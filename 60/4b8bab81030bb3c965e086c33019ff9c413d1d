Thanks for bringing our attention to this important topic.

According to (https://p2sh.info/dashboard/db/bip-69-stats) around 60% of
transaction follow bip69 (possibly just by chance).

If its useful, a bitcoin wiki page that tracks wallets which use bip69
can be created. A similar page exists for bech32
(https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption). If we had this at least
we'd know which open source wallets we can write code for or which
closed source wallets we can bug about bip69.

Let's say I'm clustering a wallet and know they're using a wallet that always uses bip69, and I'm looking at a transaction in that cluster and trying to guess which is the change and which is not. There's a lot of things you can use to assign a probability. The most obvious thing is looking at the amount of significant-digits of the output amounts  (if they vary a lot, change tends to be the one with more), but a much more powerful one is looking at how the outputs are spent (and if they end up spend-linking back into the original cluster).

While I was genuinely taken aback by how accurate some of their analysis can be, I also found it pretty easy to trick -- implying it relies heavily on some fragile heuristics.

And in fact, we're already starting to see some minor effects of this (e.g. people already know that if they gamble their funds, they'll probably have trouble using an exchange later). And I don't think we're too far from the point where any "unidentified" bitcoin is instantly flagged as "suspicious" (and for instance, requires more explaining for by exchanges) potentially seriously harming bitcoin fungibility and it's value determined also by it's history.
