What "consensus rule" do you refer to?

Indeed, I suggest you look to actions-- it's not hard to find changes
in Bitcoin Core that one contributor or another disliked. Did you try?
 (In this case, I don't even believe we have any regulator
contributors that disagree).
-- even for changes that effected system consensus, in fact. These
things were not hard-forks, however, as there never has been one (+/-
terminology disputes); and part of the point I was making was that the
standard for that is different, and that these differences begin with
technological fundamentals.
