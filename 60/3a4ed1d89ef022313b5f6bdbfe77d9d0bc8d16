Also the other limitation for ECDSA is that there is no known protocol to
create a signture with a+b (where keys P=aG, Q=bG, R=P+Q=(a+b)G). without
either a sending its private key to b or viceversa (or both to a third
party).

With Schnorr sigs you can do it, but the k^-1 term in ECDSA makes a (secure)
direct multiparty signature quite difficult.

ps probably only 1 party needs to hash their key

P=aG      
            H(P) ->

		<- Q=bG

	   P ->
