In this case it's not a question extra txouts, its a question of
additional pushes. Assuming you didn't get the push overhead for free,
the only issue I see with that off the cuff is extra complexity in the
IsStandard rule... but really, why?  Your application already needs to
define the meaning of the data? what point is there in making your
hash commitment less uniform with the rest of the network?
