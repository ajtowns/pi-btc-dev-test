Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Soft fork for BIPs 68, 112, and 113
Message-ID: <CAPWm=eWYGsD78wuCeg9RBiPQg2B8XzS-om85bEcJyL2A1Kfb-w@mail.gmail.com>

Bitcoin Core is ready to move towards deployment of a soft fork which will
implement BIP's 68, 112, and 113.

BIP 68 - Relative lock-time using consensus-enforced sequence numbers -
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki
BIP 112 - CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY -
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki
BIP 113 - Median time-past as endpoint for lock-time calculations -
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki

BIP 113 logic was introduced in the 0.11.2 release as a standardness rule
and BIP 68 and BIP 112 logic has been merged into master*.
What remains to be done is finish testing, merge the logic to activate the
soft forks and backport the code to supported releases.

The exact rollout mechanism is still being finalized but will be
coordinated with the community.

This email is meant to serve as a readiness announcement and confirm that
there are no outstanding concerns.

Thanks,
Alex


* -  BIP 68 and BIP 112 logic is only enforced when the tx version is >= 2
which will only become standard with the release of the soft fork code.
