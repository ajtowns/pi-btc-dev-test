Do you need to do full validation? There's an economic cost to mining
invalid blocks, and even if that were acceptable there's really no
reason to perform such an attack. The result would be similar to a block
withholding attack, but unlike block withholding it would be trivially
detectable if/when full validation was performed.

To protect yourself and to detect incorrect mining software you could
stochastically validate a randomly selected sample of shares, as your
hardware requirements allow.
