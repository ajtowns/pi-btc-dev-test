Hi Michael!

 I would like to ask you one thing:

 1- Release a new version of Libcoin closest as possible with mainline
Bitcoin.

 I mean, do not add any extra code to it and also, do not change any stdout
/ stderr messages.

 How much do you think that this will cost?

 For the extra code: I'll need to run the "blockchain side" as Linux user
called "blockchain" and, each of my regular Linux user will have its own
wallet.dat file (without the blockchain).

Thanks!
Thiago
