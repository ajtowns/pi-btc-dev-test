The concept combined with the weak blocks system where miners commit
to potential transaction inclusion with fractional difficulty blocks
is possible. I'm not personally convinced that unconfirmed transaction
display in a wallet is worth the privacy trade-off. The user has very
little to gain from this knowledge until the txn is in a block.
