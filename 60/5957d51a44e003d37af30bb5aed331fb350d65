Agreed, I was largely giving a reason why one may want to negotiate the
filter settings in response to your question as to why it was done.  As
long as there are sane limits (you cant make a 1GB filter by specifying
0% fp and some crazy number of entires), filter negotiation largely isnt
worth it (also prevents any floats from appearing in the p2p protocol,
though in either case it shouldn't be able to cause issues).
