FYI, Armory uses exactly this logic to try to clean up dust outputs in
the user's transactions.  However, there's enough conditions on it, that
I don't know how often it triggers.  Recommendations are welcome for how
to improve it.

Right now, if the transaction has less than 5 inputs, there exists dust
UTXOs from addresses already included in the transaction, and those
UTXOs are sufficiently small in priority, then the Armory will add them
to the input side and increase the change accordingly.  Looking it just
made me realize I lost the last condition of making sure the tx already
has a change output -- don't want to turn a free tx into a fee-needed tx
just to do this.  (reorganized the code
<https://github.com/etotheipi/BitcoinArmory/blob/master/armoryengine.py#L5279>
recently, and must have fell through the cracks).

Perhaps it could be improved by cleaning up dust from *any* address by
default (not just ones already included in the tx), with the option for
the user to disable that behavior.  After all, anonymity was never a
core feature of the network -- I think it makes sense that the logic
would reduce anonymity by default in exchange for a cleaner network,
with a clear option to "opt-out" of that logic if user cares.  I think
most users don't actually care...
