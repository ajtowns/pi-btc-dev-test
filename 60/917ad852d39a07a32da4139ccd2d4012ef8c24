Right. The issue (AIUI) is that, right now, even though transactions are
evaluated for inclusion as a group with CPFP, they're not yet evaluated for
relaying as a unit, nor can they be, because the current p2p protocol
doesn't have a way to send multiple transactions in a single protocol
message to signify that they should be evaluated together.
