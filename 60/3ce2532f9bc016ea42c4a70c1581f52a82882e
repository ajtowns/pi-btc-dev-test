Why not just put an expiration date on that information and delay deletion until the expiration is reached?

Also, its worth noting how the node bit solution you proposed can be done as a gradual upgrade path for SPV client. From the perspective of nodes that don't know about it they just see the pruned nodes as SPV nodes without any chain data at all. The only issue would be if large numbers of uses turned off their full nodes, but that's a possibility regardless. Done with partial UTXO set mode this may even result in an eventual increase in the number of full nodes.
