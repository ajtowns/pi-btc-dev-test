It's part of a general trend wherein people look at all the things
that can be accomplished in an economy that has a division of labor*,
and see some misbehavior at the edges, and decide that rather than
fixing the misbehavior we should throw out the entire concept of labor
specialization.

Hating on labor specialization as a concept, rather than simply
finding solutions for specialist misbehavior, was the basis for scrypt
mining, PoS, and MaidSafe.
