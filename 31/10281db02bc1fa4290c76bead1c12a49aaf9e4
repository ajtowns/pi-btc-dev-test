I don?t really see the problem here, even if your math is a off. (Statistics 
is difficult, I know). Connecting to many nodes to download faster is really 
not an issue and already happens.

You make the assumption that this new mode of pruning will be used by 100% 
of the network, this is not how distributed systems work.
