I understand the theoretical benefits of multi-sig. But if you want
to make this mind-numbingly simple, do it on the *existing* single-sig.

But why in the world do we not have a *business* that offers bitcoin
wallet insurance? The bitcoin world (and this list) ran around blaming
MtGox and users for being 'stupid' to trust mtgox.

So start a multi-level marketing business that offers *insurance* so
if your bitcoin wallet gets hacked/stolen/whatever, your 'upstream'
or whomever sold you the wallet comes to your house with a new 
computer or installs the new wallet software, or whatever, or just
makes it good.

Now, if the **insurance underwriter** decides that multisig will 
reduce fraud, and **tests it**, then I'd say we do multi-sig. But right
now we are just a bunch of technology wizards trying to force our own
opinions about what's right and 'simple' for end users without ever
asking the damn end-users.

And then we call the end-users idiots because some scammer calls them
and says "I'm calling from Microsoft and your computer is broke, please
download this software to fix it".

Multi-sig is more magical moon-math that scammers will exploit to con
your grandma out of bitcoin, and then your friends will call her a stupid
luddite for falling for it.

Fix the cultural victim-blaming bullshit and you'll fix the node bleeding
problem.
