Bitcoin Core doesnt have to do this. It is rational if you have >25% of
hash power (or if you believe 25% of hash power is doing this) to do this.
If a 75% hardfork target is reached, and >25% of the hashpower doesnt
allow the hardfork, and the hardfork is strictly more permissive than
the original (ie it is essentially a reverse softfork - there are no
previously valid blocks which are not still valid), then the miners who
voted for the fork would be constantly generating blocks which are
soft-forked-out by the >25% and non-supporting miners.
I believe this was pointed out to the Bitcoin XT folks weeks ago, but
apparently did not sway the decision to use 75% and a (as far as I can
tell?) strictly more permissive hardfork.
