I suggest revising these items for clarity (and I'm guessing on the first
one)

    Calculate hardLimit by examining the coinbase scriptSig votes of the
previous 12,000 blocks, and taking the 20th percentile.
    A new hardLimit may not increase or decrease by more than 1.2x beyond
the prior hardLimit.

to:

    The new hardLimit is calculated by sorting the coinbase scriptSig votes
of the last 12,000 blocks from lowest to highest and using the vote of the
2400th block.
    If the vote of the 2400th block is a change of less than 20%, use it as
the new hardLimit.  Otherwise, change the hardLimit to be closer to that
vote, to either 120% or 80% of the current hardLimit.

I don't understand #5, 75% rule.  Shouldn't invalid version 4 blocks always
be rejected?
