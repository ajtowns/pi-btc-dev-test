Hi Justin,

Your lookup solution is indeed more efficient than OpenAlias, and more
robust to DoS. However, that is not because you use a two-tier lookup.

Indeed, instead of having the following records:
_wallet.sample = "btc ltc"
_btc._wallet.sample = "mybitcoinadress"

you could simply have:
_wallet.sample = "btc ltc"
_btc.sample = "mybitcoinaddress"

In practice, a wallet supporting only Bitcoin will skip the currencies
lookup in both cases, and go directly for the _btc record.

One benefit of having an intermediate "_wallet" level is to allow zone
delegation. Is that the reason for that choice?

Thomas
