If one has a "root" commitment with other nested descendent
multi-transaction contracts, then changing the txid of the root commitment
will invalidated all the nested multi tx contracts. In our specific case, we
have pre-signed 2-stage HTLC transaction which rely on a stable txid. As a
result, we can't use the ANYONECANPAY approach atm.

Agreed, see the recent proposal to introduce SIGHASH_NOINPUT as a new
sighash type. IMO it presents an opportunity to introduce more flexible fine
grained sighash inclusion control.
