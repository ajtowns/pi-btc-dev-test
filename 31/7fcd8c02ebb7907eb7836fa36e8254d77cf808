I made a distinction between lowercase bitcoin meaning the unit of account
in uppercase Bitcoin, the system as a whole. The proposal would make
bitcoins not last forever, which allows the Bitcoin system to scale better
and have a better chance of lasting forever.

Exactly. That?s the whole idea. Why bother have nodes store UTXO?s for lost
bitcoins? This proposal would essentially sanitize the UTXO set that nodes
keep track of and clear up wasted space.
