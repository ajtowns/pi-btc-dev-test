I've actually offered (on irc) to fix the latter a few times and been told that a pull removing implementations from the headers would not be merged so have not wasted the effort. (Because it's a rather large one.) Not only does this cause long build times it makes adding new code in the logically "right" places nearly impossible due to the build deps.

I agree with pretty much the entirety of your post and think all of it needs to be discussed further and addressed.
