How can I improve this? Inevitably, every medium of communications will be 
controlled by someone (even if unmoderated, it becomes effectively controlled 
by trolls who spam it with garbage).

I think it's important to note that this is also only for updating the status 
of BIPs, and is not in any way relevant to such proposals *actually* being 
accepted. So if the BIP process were to breakdown on this or any other point, 
it isn't somehow controlling the actual reality. To explicitly clarify this 
point, I have added to the end of the section:
    "These criteria are considered objective ways to observe the de facto
     adoption of the BIP, and are not to be used as reasons to oppose or
     reject a BIP. Should a BIP become actually and unambiguously adopted
     despite not meeting the criteria outlined here, it should still be
     updated to Final status."
Does that help?

Thanks,

Luke
