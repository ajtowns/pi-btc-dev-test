They generally don't have to switch to an altcoin when they get to
choose which blocks they accept ultimately. This is a key component of
Bitcoin's incentive model since it makes it so miners are unlikely to
do a hard fork if their blocks would not be accepted by nodes/users.
For example if 55% of miners wanted to hard fork and change the block
reward back to 50 BTC the minority side would not need to switch to an
altcoin, they would just need to ignore those 50 BTC block reward
blocks.

By backwards compatible I mean being able to continue functioning
without updating the node, soft forks are generally backwards
compatible because you can still transact even if you don't upgrade
your node to support the soft fork, you just won't be able to use the
new soft fork features.
