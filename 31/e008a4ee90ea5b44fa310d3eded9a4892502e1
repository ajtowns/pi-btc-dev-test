Sure thing, I'm looking for a good way to publish these measurements,
but I haven't found a good option yet. They are rather large in size,
so I'd rather not serve them along with the website as it hasn't got
the capacity. Any suggestions? If the demand is not huge I could
provide them on a per user basis.
