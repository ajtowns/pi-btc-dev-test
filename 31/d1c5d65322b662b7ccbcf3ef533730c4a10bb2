That proposal is equivalent to an under-damped oscillator, and would still see
significant oscillation between blocks if miners were switching on and off
hardware.

The optimal solution is the one I quote, and is well known, just not in the
bitcoin community.

"faster relaxation time" refers to the time constant of the exponential damping.
if you make it too fast, you create an over-damped oscillator.  The system
cannot measure oscillation faster than the block time, so damping on shorter
timescales is useless.  The optimal damping is given by the critically damped
oscillator.

Tonight at BitDevsNYC, Mike Wozniak pointed out that SPV wallets must also
calculate retargeting, but this is a terribly simple calculation, and while more
complex from a coding perspective, would not be noticeable in run-time of SPV
wallets.
