The tor network works based on a centralized (well, in theory,
federated) trusted directory service. (More info in
https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git?a=blob_plain;hb=HEAD;f=dir-spec.txt).

Much of data that is not related to relay related is just generated by
probes, e.g. semi-trusted bandwidth authorities that measure node
performance back to the directory authorities.

More info on their monitoring work is available here:
