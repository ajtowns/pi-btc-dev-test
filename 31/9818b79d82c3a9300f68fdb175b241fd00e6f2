Bitcoin is a success.

The success has forced various hardfork discussions.

Hard forking is contentious. If a softfork cannot be achieved the
alternate to a hardfork is creating a new bitcoin. ex bitcoin 2.0

Similar to silver, gold, palladium, etc...

Bitcoins success partly stems from it's brand awareness. Any new
officially supported bitcoin will also benefit from this brand awareness.

If the market values the new improved bitcoin they will put their money
into it. This doesn't require any consensus.

Let the market decide which option has the most value. If everyone
switches to the new bitcoin then the old bitcoin miners will follow.
