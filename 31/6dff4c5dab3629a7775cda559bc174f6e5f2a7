The difference is that right now, full nodes will happily follow a shorter 
best-valid chain. This BIP would require them to hold back at the best-common 
block between the best-valid chain and the invalid chain, forcing the user to 
make a decision whether to reject the invalid chain permanently, or upgrade to 
a version which can understand that chain as valid.

Note: a malicious "SHF" is not a SHF at all, but an "evil fork".

Nodes implementing this BIP will see it as a simple hardfork, but will 
intentionally provide equivalent behaviour as older nodes which see it as a 
soft-hardfork. In other words, all [compatible] hardforks will now behave like 
a soft-hardfork without any special DMMS design.

If Bitcoin's eventual hardfork is far enough down the road (such that no nodes 
remain from before this BIP are adopted), the SHF design could be safely done 
away with entirely. And either way, it makes it easier to resist an un-
consented-to hardfork.
