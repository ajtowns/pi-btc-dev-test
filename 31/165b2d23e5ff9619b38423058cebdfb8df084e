The rest is "authentication".

You were perfectly clear. Did I give some indication that I did not understand what you meant?

Posting txs to the network is a client-server scenario. The set of txs arriving at an arbitrary node, including the order of arrival, is by definition public information. The only possible way it could be considered private is if the entire network was private.

So where does the private timing become public? First hop, second, third?

Encryption and authentication cannot prevent timing attacks against a person posting txs to the network unless the entire network is "secured". That is not possible without centralized access control.

Encrypting the P2P network doesn't resolve this problem, nor does authentication, nor does Tor. I would prefer we advance an actual solution to this significant problem than advance a false sense of security while creating both complexity and the likely evolution of node identity.
