Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Reference implementation (wip) of bip-genvbvoting
	(generalized version bits)
Message-ID: <O_LZ72OAX3MqjySQ39s5sFTu5TIQaUrAMR89a6-F-3XlkG8k8itR28ZkZolWGjs2btFcxcoWZlIz8hVsRU0Kkq3QwM0i9AZTojy4pUvXck0=@protonmail.com>

Dear all,

An initial reference implementation of bip-genvbvoting (spec: [1]) is now available at

https://github.com/sanch0panza/bitcoin/commits/genvbvoting-bu-dev-clean1

starting at commit fdd83383436ee43b072c258d4a6feb713902c77e .

This development is based against the Bitcoin Unlimited 'dev' branch, and has been submitted as PR458 to BU [2].
The naming of the new 'bipgenvb_forks' output section in the 'getblockchain' RPC interface is to be considered temporary while the BIP has no formal number.

I would be happy to get any feedback while I implement a corresponding pull request for a reference implementation on Bitcoin Core. Due to other commitments this may come at a later stage - if someone else is eager to port it over, please feel free.

Regards,
Sancho

P.S. The revised "unknown version check" code is considered an implementation specific and not part of core functionality, and is consequently not fully covered by regression tests.
