As usual, you don't need a hardfork.

Anyway, one-sided trade is sufficient to get a functioning marketplace
up and running and test out the many other issues with this stuff prior
to forking anything.

You can make the same argument against Bitcoin itself you know...

A Bitmessage-like network would be trivial to front-run via a sybil
attack. It's the fundemental problem with marketplaces - the data
they're trying to publish has to be public.

And again, how do you know that record is honest? Fact is without
proof-of-publication you just don't.

You mean a reverse nLockTime that makes a transaction invalid after a
certain amount of time - that's dangerous in a reorg unfortunately as it
can make transactions permenantly invalid.
