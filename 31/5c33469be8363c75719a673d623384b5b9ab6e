Sorry Bryan, this was the first paper posted to this list since I've
been on it that I added to my site. I was quite excited about this.

I was not planning on and certainly won't be making this advertisement
after every paper posted on this list (I may do it on reddit). I did
post on reddit a few times yes, but I assumed that this list's user
base didn't overlap extremely (does it?). I'm not sure why my posts
got down voted there. The down voters gave me no constructive feedback
about the usefulness of my site, and neither have you.

Are you able to give me your feedback on the site I've spent quite
some time setting up privately so that we don't spam this list again?
