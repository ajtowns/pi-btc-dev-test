I don't like this scheme at all. It doesn't seem to make bitcoin
better, it makes it worse.

Lets say it's 2050 and I want to sweep a paper wallet I created in
2013. I can't just make the TX and send it to the network, I have to
first contact an "archive node" to get the UTXO data in order to make
the TX. How is this better than how the system works today?

Since many people are going to be holding BTC long term (store of
value of a first-class feature of bitcoin), this scheme is going to
effect pretty much all users.

These archive nodes will be essential to network's operation. If there
are no running archive nodes, the effect on the network is the same as
the network today without any full nodes.

Anyways, UTXO size is a function of number of users, rather than a
function of time. If tons of people join the network, UTXO still will
increase no matter what. All this change is going to do is make it
harder for people to use bitcoin. A person can still generate 1GB of
UTXO data, but as long as they spend those UTXOs within the amount
they are still using those resources.

IMO, wildcard inputs is still the best way to limit the UTXO set.
