Real quick (I've received some off-list replies and do plan to respond to those), want to be clear: this thread is not meant to be interpreted as a proposal to modify Bitcoin (it is not a BIP), it is just, exactly as the subject says, some thoughts I had that I hadn't seen expressed elsewhere, that I felt like sharing, in case they are at all useful/interesting to anyone.

Cheers,
Greg

Changing the max number of coins, the block reward, the difficulty algo, mining policy and protocol is going to be a non-starter. Also, what are the proposed quantifiavle benefits from removing timestamps? How would this be done at the protocol level? Are these other changes related to removing timestamps/rationale for other supply changes?
