TREZOR does not support BIP70. I think they planned to work on it after
multi-sig support, which is now done, so I'm hoping that it's next on their
roadmap.

The signing features of BIP70 have (fortunately!) been implemented by
payment processors quite early, before we really have the client side fully
figured out and implemented. Mobile wallets (Android, iOS) do implement it
and they are reasonably secure, for desktops we need TREZOR and we need the
Bitcoin Authenticator 2-factor wallet to support it. I think they do, but
can't remember exactly. Either they do, or it's on their roadmap.
