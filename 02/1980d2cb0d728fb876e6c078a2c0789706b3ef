Related:  Current multi-sig wallet technology being rolled out now,
with 2FA and other fancy doodads, is now arguably more secure than my
PGP keyring.  My PGP keyring is, to draw an analogy, a non-multisig
wallet (set of keys), with all the associated theft/data
destruction/backup risks.

The more improvements I see in bitcoin wallets, the more antiquated my
PGP keyring appears.  Zero concept of multisig.  The PGP keyring
compromise process is rarely exercised.  2FA is lacking.  At least
offline signing works well. Mostly.
