This isn't really a security issue, it's a software reliability issue. And
you're making a trade-off between complexity of the core protocol and
complexity of wallet software.

A core protocol failure has high costs for every single Bitcoin user; a wallet
software failure affects a much smaller number of people. So I'd be inclined to
prioritise core protocol simplicity rather than stamping out one of many, many,
ways that wallet software can screw up and lose money.
