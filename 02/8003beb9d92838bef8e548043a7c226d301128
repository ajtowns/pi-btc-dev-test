Hash: SHA512

It would - it assumes you have the set of keys and are sorting before
you derive and send funds to such a P2SH address.

It seems there is scope for further narrowing down how a multisig
scripthash address should be determined - what do people think of
anticipating only compressed keys for scripts?

It's possible to cause confusion if one put forward a compressed key at
some time, and an uncompressed key at another. A different script hash
would be produced even though there is no difference to the keys
involved. The client will not search for this.


Having spoken with Jean-Pierre and Ruben about this for quite some time
now, there is 100% the need for a BIP outlining this. Everyone has had
the idea at some point, and some of us already using it, but people
shouldn't have to go digging in BIP45 for the two lines which mention
it. All we need is a place to put the docs.

I am building up a list of implementations which currently support
sorting, and briefly describing a motivation for such a BIP.
