You guys are representing both extremes of the issue.  In response to 
Jeff and Luke-Jr, I don't see how this is /just any other poltical 
issue/.  It strikes at the heart of everything Bitcoin is about.  
Barring Bitcoin-specific legislation, I don't see how any legislation 
could be more relevant to Bitcoin and the community around it.

On the other hand, Bitcoin is still a non-entity, and shouldn't get in 
the business of making statements.  A central voice for Bitcoin gives 
the impression that it is actually centralized, and one that has 
opinions.  Plus I wouldn't be surprised if some, heavily-invested 
Bitcoin users were of the opinion that SOPA/PIPA/whatever could be a 
huge profit for themselves:  once SOPA kicks in and businesses around 
the world start getting cut off for legit or illegitimate purposes, a 
lot of them could potentially switch to Bitcoin to keep their business 
going.  That could be a huge boon for Bitcoin.  You may not agree it's 
worth the tradeoff, but people are selfish and may not actually 
understand or even care about SOPA legislation itself.

I think it's /not inappropriate/ for something to be mentioned on the 
website about Bitcoin's philosophy being threatened by SOPA, but I agree 
Bitcoin should avoid making any bold political stands.  Users could be 
reminded that SOPA affects yet another thing they care about, but it 
might be better to avoid it altogether.  If any response is made, it 
should be a very light one.
