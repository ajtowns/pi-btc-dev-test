Definitely agree - like I said, I publish this only because I keep getting
asked about it.

That's right. There's little point in having multiple PKI's simultaneously,
that's why it doesn't allow it.

This one is a special case because it doesn't replace but rather
specialises and extends the existing PKI. Old clients that don't understand
it would still show something useful and by upgrading you get better
output. Actually you get closer to the output you're supposed to get.

That's going to be rare though, I think. Generally you wouldn't want to
have multiple PKIs in use simultaneously for the same payment request.

It can be done but only by sacrificing backwards compatibility, which
doesn't seem worth it to me. It's hardly a big deal to have two signature
fields. The rest is all localised to the X509 parts.
