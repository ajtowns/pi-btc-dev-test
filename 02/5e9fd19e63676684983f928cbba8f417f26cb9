Figured I would have a crack at reviewing this since Mike is out for a bit.
It was great running into you guys at the bitcoin fair in SF! Small world :)

I like how simple this is. You just give it an url to fetch the next
payment request and a date to fetch it.

What should happen if the client tries to fetch the PaymentRequest early or
late? Does it become valid after some date and stay valid for some length
of time? Also, what should happen if the client tries to consume the same
PaymentRequest twice (or multiple times) during the same period?

I do not think daily/weekly/monthly is flexible enough. What do you think
about having a concrete start time and end time when the next
PaymentRequest will be valid? This also prevents the wallet from having to
remember when it last sent a payment and getting skewed over time.

When a wallet hits the polling_url to download the next PaymentRequest, it
seems we need a way to communicate an error code to the wallet, for example
if the server canceled the contract without the wallet knowing. Perhaps a
separate polling_status_url, with a corresponding ACK message to indicate
if the PaymentRequest is available. What do you think of that idea?

One high-level comment -- the wallet in this design doesn't have any way of
knowing when the payments are supposed to end. I feel this is important to
show to the user before they start their wallet polling infinitely.
