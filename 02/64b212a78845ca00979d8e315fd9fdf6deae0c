Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Need help testing/debugging: Linux64
Message-ID: <CABsx9T2KkFC9_sibE4gYdd2JCTSSdbVQcOmK1nbKFYns820_7A@mail.gmail.com>

There is one issue holding up a 0.5.0/0.4.1 final release:  I've seen
a couple of bug reports of crashes on startup when re-encrypting
previously encrypted wallets on Linux64 systems.

I've tried to reproduce on Ubuntu 10.10 server and "it worked for me"
-- so I need help figuring out what is going on (is it only bitcoin-qt
that is crashing? Is Ubuntu OK but other linux variations broken?
etc)
