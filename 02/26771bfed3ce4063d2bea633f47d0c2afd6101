Because if the user does not use tor or an analogous infrastructure
(e.g. something else reimplementing tor's functionality) the user can
be deanonymized in many different ways.

At the end of the day, if I'm listening widely to the network, and
your host is regularly the first to hand me your transactions then I
can draw reasonably reliable conclusions... and this is true even if
there is a complete absence of identifiable characteristics otherwise.

And, on the flip side if the host is persistently behind tor, even
with some watermarkable behaviour, their privacy is protected.  So
making sure that hosts can continually use tor (or similar systems)
should be the higher priority.  (And, of course, not reimplementing
tor  leverages the millions of dollars of investment and dozens of
subject matter experts working on that system).
