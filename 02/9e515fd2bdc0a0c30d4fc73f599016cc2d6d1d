I am waiting for the bitcoin (not bitcoin-dev) mailing list so that anyone
who writes "That's off-topic" can also include a link to it.

Someone else mentioned that they read all these emails in about 15
minutes.  I'm a bit slower than that, but I'm reading the vitcoin-xt stuff
too.  It isn't too much for me, but it will be nice to have a more open
list, such as is planned.  What's the hold up?  Don't answer here, at least
not until the list is ready :-)
