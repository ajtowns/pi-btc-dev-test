It's not pointless: it's a wake-up call for miners asleep "at the wheel", to 
ensure they upgrade in time. Not having a mandatory signal turned out to be a 
serious bug in BIP 9, and one which is fixed in BIP 148 (and remains a problem 
for BIP 149 as-is). Additionally, it makes the activation decisive and 
unambiguous: once the lock-in period is complete, there remains no question as 
to what the correct protocol rules are.

It also enables deploying softforks as a MASF, and only upgrading them to UASF 
on an as-needed basis.
