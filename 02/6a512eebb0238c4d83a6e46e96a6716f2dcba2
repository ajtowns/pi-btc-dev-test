That poll shows 63% of votes want a larger than 1 MB block by this summer.
How do you go from that to "the community opposes any block increase ever"?
It shows the exact opposite of that.

The reason people stop running nodes is because there's no incentive to
counteract the resource costs. Attempting to solve this by making blocks
*smaller* is like curing a disease by killing the patient. (Incentivizing
full node operation would fix that problem.)
