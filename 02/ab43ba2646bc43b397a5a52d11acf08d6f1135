Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Synchronization: 19.5 % orphaned blocks at
	height 197'324
Message-ID: <53E776D1.1010503@bitwatch.co>

Hello all,

I'm currently synchronizing a new node and right now, at a progress of a
height of 197'324 blocks, I count in my debug.log an aweful amount of
38'447 orphaned blocks which is about 19.5 %.

It has been I while since I watched the synchronization process closely,
but this number seems pretty high to me.

I'm wondering about the following: would it be possible for a malicious
party to generate chains of blocks with low difficulity which are not
part of the main chain to slow down the sync process?
