Hi,

Is your simulation code available somewhere?

I was just wondering why mycelium generates a very big UTXO set for <1000sat, because change outputs will never be smaller than 
5460sat (=TransactionUtils.MINIMUM_OUTPUT_VALUE). If the change would be lower, it simply is skipped and added to the miner fee:
	-> https://github.com/mycelium-com/wallet/blob/master/public/bitlib/src/main/java/com/mrd/bitlib/StandardTransactionBuilder.java#L334

Does your simulation account for that?

It might also be that the small UTXO came from external tx and we never spend them, bec. of pruning/privacy. Not sure how we could optimize that.

Cheers,
Daniel
