So "+1"ing is OK as long as I provide a technical explanation of why I agree?
While I still think that this is too much of a restriction because it prevents 
peer-review, I would say that I could live with it as a last resort if you 
don't plan to abolish this rule altogether.

So in that case, to foster peer review, I would recommend you amend the rules 
to clarify this.
Example: "+1s are not allowed unless you provide an explanation of why you 
agree with something".
