That sentence doesn't quite parse ("say it nLockTime"), so please
forgive me if I'm misunderstanding you. Are you saying that you want
IsStandard() to require a transaction have a locktime of 0 (no
confirmation delay) if any of its inputs use a non-final sequence?

If so, wouldn't that make locktime useless for delaying confirmation in
IsStandard() transactions because the consensus rules require at least
one input be non-final in order for locktime to have any effect?

Thanks,
