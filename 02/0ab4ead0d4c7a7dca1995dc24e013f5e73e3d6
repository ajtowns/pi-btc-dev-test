That seems like it just says bitcoin core has two classes of users:
people who use it directly following mainnet or testnet, and people who
make derived works based on it to run altcoins.

Having a "responsible disclosure" timeline something like:

 * day -N: vulnerability reported privately
 * day -N+1: details shared amongst private trusted bitcoin core group
 * day 0: patch/workaround/mitigation determined, CVE reserved
 * day 1: basic information shared with small group of trusted users
      (eg, altcoin maintainers, exchanges, maybe wallet devs)
 * day ~7: patches can be included in git repo
      (without references to vulnerability)
 * day 90: release candidate with fix available
 * day 120: official release including fix
 * day 134: CVE published with details and acknowledgements

could make sense. 90 days / 3 months is hopefully a fair strict upper
bound for how long it should take to get a fix into a rc; but that's still
a lot longer than many responsible disclosure timeframes, like CERT's at
45 days, but also shorter than some bitcoin core minor update cycles...
Obviously, those timelines could be varied down if something is more
urgent (or just easy).

As it is, not publishing vulnerability info just seems like it gives
everyone a false sense of security, and encourages ignoring good security
practices, either not upgrading bitcoind nodes, or not ensuring altcoin
implementations keep up to date...

I suppose both "trusted bitcoin core group" and "small group of trusted
users" isn't 100% cypherpunk, but it sure seems better than not both not
disclosing vulnerability details, and not disclosing vulnerabilities
at all... (And maybe it could be made more cypherpunk by, say, having
the disclosures to trusted groups have the description/patches get
automatically fuzzed to perhaps allow identification of leakers?)

Cheers,
aj
