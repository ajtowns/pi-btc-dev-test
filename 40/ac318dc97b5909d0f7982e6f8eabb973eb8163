I disagree.  There's a real perception and usability issue with the
current interface combined with the current price.  People are
intimidated by the current system, even though the price really reflects
Bitcoin starting to spread its wings (maybe prematurely, bubble-style,
but the price will have to get to this point eventually if Bitcoin will
thrive at the target scale). 

Bitcoin's learning curve is hard enough already.   As silly as it
sounds, feeling "insecure" because you only 0.00032 BTC, and then using
too many zeroes when paying for your smoothie are problems that can
really turn people off.  You say "Let the market sort it out". 
Sometimes the market needs direction and consistency.  Without us doing
anything, we just end up with fragmentation and confusion. 

I'd much prefer we reach a consensus on a path forward and push that
path hard.  Because there's always resistance to change, and confusion
along the way.  The easier and more consistent we can make it, the
smoother it will be.  We want to avoid:

"Hey, I'll sell it to you for 382 microbes." 
"What is a microbe?  Is that the same as a XBT?"
"I don't know, my wallet uses NBC."
"Well how much BTC is it? Okay, just send me 0.00038200 BTC"
"Four zeros after the decimal?"
"Yeah... oh wait you just sent me 10x"
...

Again it sounds silly, but this is a real usability issue.
