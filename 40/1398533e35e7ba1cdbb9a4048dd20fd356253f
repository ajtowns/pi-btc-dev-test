Maybe you are confused with a compilation notice that would say "All 
Content Copyright and other rights reserved by its Respective Owners" or 
something similar.  That is not the same thing as claiming ownership 
using the "c" inside the circle.

There is also a difference between claiming a copyright for individual 
works as part of a compilation as opposed to claiming a copyright on the 
compilation itself (which is what the current notice is).
