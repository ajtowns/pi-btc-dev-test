That description makes sense.  It also makes sense to separate out the 
hard fork from the soft fork process.   Right now some people want to 
use the soft fork procedure for a hard fork simply because there is no 
other way to do it.

I am under the impression that most users expect changes/improvements 
that would require a hard fork so I think some kind of process needs to 
be developed.  Taking the responsibility off the shoulder of the core 
maintainer also makes sense.  The hard fork issue is too much of a 
distraction for people trying to maintain the nuts and bolts of the 
underlying system.

I saw a suggestion that regularly scheduled hard forks should be 
planned.  That seems to make sense so you would have some sort of 
schedule where you would have cut off dates for hard-fork BIP 
submissions.  That way you avoid the debates over whether there should 
be hard forks to what should be contained within the hard fork (if 
needed).  It makes sense to follow the BIP process as close as 
possible.  Possibly adding another step after "Dev acceptance" to 
include input from others such as merchants/exchanges/miners/users.  It 
will only be an approximation of "decentralization" and the process 
won't be perfect but if you want to move forward then you need some way 
to do it.
