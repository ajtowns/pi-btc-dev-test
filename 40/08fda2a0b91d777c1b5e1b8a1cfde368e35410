Suggestions always welcome!

The main problem with this is that the block chain is mostly random bytes
(hashes, keys) so it doesn't compress that well. It compresses a bit, but
not enough to change the fundamental physics.

However, that does not mean the entire chain has to be stored on expensive
rotating platters. I've suggested that in some star trek future where the
chain really is gigantic, it could be stored on tape and spooled off at
high speed. Literally a direct DMA from tape drive to NIC. But we're not
there yet :)
