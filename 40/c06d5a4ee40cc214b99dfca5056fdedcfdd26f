I like the concept except that it only works if every node connected to the
miner enforces the rule (if it works).  Once any one of the nodes forwards
the block,  other nodes see it coming from a node that can pass the
challenge.

I don't think any solution based on node queries will succeed,  especially
if it requires spontaneous super-majority-of-nodes acceptance.  I think
it's gotta be based on the block itself and each nodes' own info.

If you could spontaneously get all miners to agree not to build off of
anti-social blocks (however that is defined) ,  it would have a chance of
making a difference,  but individual miners would have an advantage
building off the antisocial block because they only need to produce one to
create the longest chain (and collect reward) while the miners following
the rules need two blocks.
