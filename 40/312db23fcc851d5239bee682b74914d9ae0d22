Subject: [Bitcoin-development] [RFC] Canonical input and output ordering
 in transactions

FWIW, The Open Assets colored coin protocol (CoinPrism) places special
significance on the zeroth input and the position of the OP_RETURN colored
coin marker output to distinguish colored coin issuance outputs from
transfer outputs. Reordering the inputs or the outputs breaks the colored
coin representation.

Recommending sorting of the inputs and outputs as a best practice is fine
(and better than random, IMO), but not as part of IsStandard() or consensus
rules.  There are cases where the order of the inputs and outputs is
significant.
