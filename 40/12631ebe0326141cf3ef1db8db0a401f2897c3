Really, if people want to pursue a goal anything like this, they should be 
looking for "ASIC already widely owned" as the property rather than "anti-
ASIC". Thus, a sufficiently memory-hard PoW would really be "RAM is the ASIC". 
Whether it's possible to make this or not, is another question. And then we 
get back to "is is really a desirable property to have people capable of 
mining who have not given any indication of interest?"
