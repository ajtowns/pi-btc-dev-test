Your proposal does not solve the issue related to Mike creating his own
fork. He created his own for because he had a non-consensus feature set
that Bitcoin Core disagreed with and he wanted. That is to be _encouraged_.
I also maintain my own Bitcoin fork with a specific (non-consensus) feature
for the same reason and I am perfectly happy with the arrangement, as are
my userbase.

Classification of BIPs is fine, I have no problem with that and I support
your BIP, but your proposition it would have stopped Mike from creating his
own distribution is false (nor desirable): it was down to a strong
differing of technical opinions between Mike and a dozen other developers
as well as node security concerns (which were proved correct).
