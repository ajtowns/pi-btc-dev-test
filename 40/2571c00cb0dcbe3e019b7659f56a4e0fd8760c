Yup I've been looking over twister thoroughly this week, it's very close to what I'm thinking and I'm sure the developer of that could easily do the project I'm doing. However he decided to make an alt coin and didn't use the real blockchain, which makes his network weak. It's a waste to not take advantage of the immense bitcoin computing power for this. I'm only planning on storing hashes in the blockchain though to prevent data bloat, and the parallel program which stores all the data will be a lot like twister. Additionally I'm going to take it beyond a messaging system, will be able to literally upload anything and everything to this system. Theres no limit to what this de-centralized system can do if designed correctly. Crypto graffiti has given a taste of that by uploading jpeg and png to the blockchain. 

Will be working on this 24/7 until the first release, will definitely tell you and others when the code is ready to be looked over. Fortunately I am employed by bitcoin so I can focus on this

It sounds very similar to what you're trying to do.  Also, I'd be willing to help out in the form of running some alpha/beta software as part of the network once you get something working.  Depending what languages you're writing in, I might help with code.

 Zander is working on the same thing: 
            <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" removedlink__58ec13b3-aba4-4e37-b10b-87cbd851ae2f__href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AetheralResearch/">https://www.reddit.com/r/AetheralResearch/</a> 
            
 
            
 But it's actually quite difficult to make it truly censorship-resistant: both in solving the theymos factor and spam/abuse/overloading as an attack.

 We have /r/bitcoinxt and so far it has been great. But we also need a regular forum.

            <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" removedlink__58ec13b3-aba4-4e37-b10b-87cbd851ae2f__href="https://bitcoin.com/forum/">https://bitcoin.com/forum/</a> would be nice. 
            
 
            
 And it must be a real community, not "say whatever you want because free speech". We've seen how that turned out to be. 
            
 
            
 Something like 
            <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" removedlink__58ec13b3-aba4-4e37-b10b-87cbd851ae2f__href="http://battle.net">battle.net</a> or Steam forums: heavily moderated, not for opinions, but for spam/noise/insults. 
            
 
            
 Again, this needs leadership. Anyone can install a forum software, what is needed is an "official seal of approval" and regular presence of top XT people there. 
            
 
            
 And a will to setup proper moderation. Then people will move.
