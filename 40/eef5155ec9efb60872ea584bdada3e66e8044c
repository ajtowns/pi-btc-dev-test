Nobody has complained about Bitcoin-XT (nor libbitcoin, nor libcoin,
nor against any other of the multiple alternative implementations of
bitcoin).
Please, understand that people are worried about the schism hardfork,
not about the software fork (which happened long ago when some of
Hearn's changes were reverted due to security concerns). If Bitcoin-XT
didn't had a schism hardfork, nobody would be calling it "an altcoin".
For consensus rules we use "the implementation is the specification"
as a principle for multiple reasons. By separating libconsensus (a
work in progress [far less progress than I would like]) we remove
Bitcoin Core's privileged position: Bitcoin Core wouldn't be "the
specification of the consensus rules" anymore, just a reference
implementation that is not "consensus-safer" compared to alternative
implementations (since they can use libconsensus directly [or a
software fork of it in the case of a reasonable schism hardfork]).

We have many reasons to fear schism hardforks (
https://github.com/jtimon/bips/blob/bip-forks/bip-0099.mediawiki#Schism1_hardforks
), even though they may be unavoidable at some point (ie for an
ASIC-reset hardfork).
