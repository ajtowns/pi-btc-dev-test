Yes, more tests are definitely welcome.

check*sig tests are tricky, because they have to refer to previous
unspent transactions and private keys (so require a particular block
chain to test against). Brilliant ideas on a simple data-driven format
welcome.

block verification tests would be great; a collection of good/bad
block chains, starting from a common chain (maybe the testnet3
tesnet-in-a-box chain) would be very useful for regression testing.
