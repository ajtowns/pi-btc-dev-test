Right.

To me it seems more important to describe how addresses should be
discovered (i.e. to scan xpub/0/i and xpub/1/j chains using gap limit G)
instead of how the xpub was created/obtained (bip32 vs bip44).

What do you thing about changing ?h=bip32 to something like

?t=01&g=20

- t=01 meaning that chains 0 and 1 should be scanned (feel free to
change "01" into any other descriptive string)
- g=20 meaning that gap 20 should be used

OK :-)
