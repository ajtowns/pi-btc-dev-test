I agree with this, for well meaning miners.  In the case of a 51% attack,
there is an incentive to mine a block and not share it right away, so that
another block could be mined on top of it.  Because that first block wasn't
shared, it wouldn't have endorsers.  The total work represented in this
"attack" chain, even with 2 blocks, would ideally represent less work that
one fully endorsed block.  This is because, as currently proposed,
endorsers provide a work multiplier, which when a block has a full
complement of endorsers, its proof of work is doubled for the purpose of
best chain selection.  That's if we allow up to 10 endorsers each providing
a 10% work bonus.

My concern is that giving endorsers too much power potentially opens up
another attack vector where endorsers could collude to endorse an invalid
block.  But that's why it is so important that the selection criteria for
endorsers needs to be both random and narrow.  I discuss that more below.

I think that the proposal does impact consensus, which creates a high
barrier to acceptance, and I'm not yet convinced that the benefits are
worth the risk.  My hope is that in sharing the idea, we can identify ways
to reduce the risk.

Whenever there is a fork, Bitcoin chooses the chain with the most work.  I
could easily be mistaken, so correct me if I cam wrong, but based on a
current level of difficulty, any arriving valid block is going to present
an equivalent proof of work.  So currently, it makes sense to simply ignore
a second valid block.  With the proposal, if a second valid block came in
with more endorsers, it would displace the current tip.

In practice, with proper incentive, I would expect all found blocks to have
the same number of endorsers.  Therefore all incoming blocks would be
interchangeable, and it would be the case that in practice, a second valid
block would be ignored just as today.

A node endorses by providing an address for payout.  The limiting criteria
is a function of that address.

The first requirement is that the address must have a relationship to the
block that it is endorsing.  As an
example, 0000000000000000082ab88cefb003f1dc1fa25881dbd56ed58c0548fbec5382 is
the hash of a recent block.  The requirement is that the address matches
some number (TBD) of trailing bits.  If the threshold were 32 bits, then
the address (more likely, the hash of the public address) would need to end
in fbec5382..

An valid address must have some proof of stake.  Maybe that isn't fair,
because it limits participation by balance, and it is yet another case of
the rich get richer.  But without proof of stake, everyone would generate
enough addresses so that they could always find an address that meets the
first requirement.

Assuming the idea has merit, in order to get it right, we'd need much
discussion to understand what combination of PoS and size of mask makes
sense.

With my proposal, miners would not be required to payout to endorsers at
all.  I think that this would help us avoid a hard fork.  But when they
choose to payout to endorsers, yes, they would be paying out to those that
endorsed the tip of the chain that they are building on.   Why would a
miner ever do that?  Because they would benefit from the multiplier
provided by the endorsers.

Any block that includes endorsers would be providing a higher level of work
which would displace tips without endorsement.  This sort of turmoil
wouldn't sit well with anybody, so I suspect that miners would soon begin
including a full complement of endorsers.

If we were to move ahead with something like this, we might want to ramp up
the amount of the reward shared with endorsers from 0 to the final target
some years later.  I do not want to mess with short term business plans of
miners.

Thanks again for the feedback, thoughts, and questions.  I hope my answers
provide more clarity.
