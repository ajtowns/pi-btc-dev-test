Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Small update to BIP 62
Message-ID: <CAPg+sBiTURdRAZbyk3guF5YzAAQebo8yY_TuXHUKYDEdLjDUdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've sent a pull request to make a small change to BIP 62 (my
anti-malleability proposal) which is still a draft; see:
* https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/90 (the request)
* https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip62up/bip-0062.mediawiki (the result)

It makes two of the 7 new rules mandatory in new blocks, even for
old-style transactions. Both are already non-standard since 0.8.0, and
have no use cases in my opinion.

The reason for this change is dropping the requirement for signature
verification engines to be bug-for-bug compatible with OpenSSL (which
supports many non-standard encodings for signatures). Requiring strict
DER compliance for signatures means any implementation just needs to
support DER.

Comments?
