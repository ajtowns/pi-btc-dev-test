That's a good point Jim. We need to make sure that the CLTVs are far
enough in the future for the CSV timeout to expire and to grab any
preimage downstream and insert it upstream. Overall this results in an
offset of all the CLTVs to (less than) the maximum CSV timeout along the
path. This would be a fixed offset for each channel and can be announced
using the gossip protocol, so senders can take it into consideration
when computing the routes. Notice that this is not really the CLTV
delta, which would accumulate along the path, but an offset on which the
CLTV deltas build on.

In today's network we have many nodes that have a CLTV delta of 144
blocks, which quickly results in HTLC funds unavailable for several days
depending on the route length, so I don't think that adding a fixed
offset is much worse. Once we have watch-towers we can reduce both the
offset as well as the CLTV deltas. Since eltoo makes watch-towers less
expensive, given the reduced storage costs, I'd argue that it's a net
positive for the Lightning network (but then again I'm biased) :-)
