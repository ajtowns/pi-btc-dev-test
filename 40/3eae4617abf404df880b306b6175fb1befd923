Subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.9.2rc2 tagged, gitian builds needed
Message-ID: <CA+s+GJBOVvL1H6nPsm441Hrh_tjtn0fWp-fVd3+ndJNqgJ-jYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

This Friday I tagged 0.9.2rc2, with the following changes compared to 0.9.2rc1:

- #4282: cwallet init fix
- #4295: upgrade OpenSSL to 1.0.1h
- #4261: Use pnode->nLastRecv as sync score

We still need more gitian builds - I'd like to do the 0.9.2 final
release end of this week as I haven't seen any new problems reported,
but it'd be useful to get these last-minute fixes tested too.

Wladimir
