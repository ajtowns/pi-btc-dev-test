=

minfee_modes: minor internal API change as a step toward allowing
              user-customizable fee schedules

=

qmake_system_crypto++: allow building bitcoin-qt against system crypto++

    This is worthless if the crypto++ dependency is removed.

=

sharedlibs: build bitcoind against shared libraries on 'unix'

    Not sure why it's been static for so long, but most systems only have
    shared libs.

=

signal_blk_notify: -blknotifypidfile option to send SIGUSR1 to a PID when
                   there's a new best block

    Used by basically every pool now, it just sends SIGUSR1 to a poolserver.

=

bugfix_qt_uri_amount_parser: fix URI amount parser to accept exponents and
                             hexadecimals

    Please don't bother arguing over bugfix_qt_uri_amount_parser. It'll just
    be a waste of time. Neither the pro- nor anti- sides have budged over
    multiple arguments already. I can't force you guys to merge it, but I can
    at least make it easy if you decide to tolerate it. Just keep in mind that
    it doesn't hurt the BTC-only URIs at all, and if nobody ends up using it
    for other units, it can always be removed later.
        Best  case scenario: people use it and bitcoin-qt works correctly
        Worst case scenario: people don't use it, and it can be removed

=

base58_liberal_parsing: accept typos in base58 data

    The same best/worst case scenario logic as the URI parser applies
    to base58_liberal_parsing too, so long as typos aren't advertised as
    legitimate addresses.
