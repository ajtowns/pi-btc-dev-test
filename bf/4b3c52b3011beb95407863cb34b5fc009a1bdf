Do you have evidence these are intentionally unmaintained, and not users who 
have simply not had time to review and decide on upgrading?

If so, it is only based on misinformation. I am concerned you are implying 
this conclusion is true. When I spoke with you maybe a year ago with my 
concerns that block size might grow too fast, you suggested that the miners 
could be trusted to not increase the block size until necessary (which is not 
likely to be any time soon, despite the massive misinformation campaigns out 
there).

I have seen evidence which suggests the contrary. For example:

Where is yours?

But this isn't about the miner opting in, it is about the miner *observing 
economic support* for the change. I have successfully downloaded Bitcoin 
Classic's beta binaries without ANY warning that by running it, I am 
expressing that I believe the economy has approved of a hardfork.

Not that I am aware of. (But both reddit comments and forum posts have  
outlived many other posts, such as blogs, so I'm not sure why to exclude them 
specifically...)

In any case, since SPV nodes don't exist, there is probably no real need to 
address them. Everyone will know what "light client" means.

Working on a BIP draft for it, but it's not ready for publication yet. The 
basic idea is to turn the merkle root in the block header into simply a hash 
of a second block header, which is constructed to parse as a valid empty 
generation transaction under the old rules. Thus, old nodes see the forked 
blockchain as valid with continually growing work on it, but as if the blocks 
were all empty. This protects them from attackers mining a short blockchain 
they perceive as valid.
