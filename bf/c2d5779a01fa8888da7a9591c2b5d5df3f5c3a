You seem to not be familiar with how multisig transactions on Bitcoin work - 99.9% of the time theyre hidden behind p2sh and there is no way to know what keys are involved. Equally, multisig is just one of many complex scripts possible.

Look into what a segwit transaction hashes - that's a better notion of non-malleable transaction. But even then lots of transactions are malleable, and its easy to trigger those cases intentionally by third parties.

Most likely any Bitcoin United scheme would quickly diverge and fail; much simpler and more predictable to achieve convincing consensus, e.g. via proof of stake voting, or Adam Bank's extension blocks suggestions. (or of course, not trying to force controversial forks in the first place)
