There are only two testnet seeds listed in bitcoind, and one of them
returns SERVFAIL (testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org) and the other
just returns one A record (testnet-seed.bluematt.me).  No idea what
seeds bitcoinj uses.

If you are going to depend on testnet, especially for an important
demo... contribute to the infrastructure!  This stuff doesn't just fix
itself for free.
