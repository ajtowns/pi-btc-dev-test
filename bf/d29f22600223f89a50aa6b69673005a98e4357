This works if the author of the web page thought about this, and
created appropriate liks/qr codes. In many cases, addresses are
just presented for users as text, to copy.

People also send addresses in message apps and emails. Maybe if
applications start to autodetect bitcoin addresses and convert them to
bitcoin: links, there will be less need to copy-paste. But I suspect
that this feature will not be quickly adopted by applications.

There are also BIP75 and BIP47 that may help, but the number of wallets
that support these protocols is small (I think in part because of
relative complexity of these protocols).
