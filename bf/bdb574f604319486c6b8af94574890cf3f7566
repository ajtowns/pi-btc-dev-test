Thomas V: 

Your proposal misses the points that:

- this is about a unit with 1e-6 Bitcoins or 100 satoshis. 
- it is not about people who know Bitcoin and are techies, but about those who don?t and aren?t.

The reasons for such a unit are more than shifting the comma some places for convinience, 
but to align Bitcoin with capabilities of existing financial software and customs of finance and average people,
and ISO standard of currency abbreviations.

bit and XBT seems to check the boxes. 

I would love to have some feedback on xbit as per my previous mail.

Regards,
