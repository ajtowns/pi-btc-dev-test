Mmmm.... you'd have to:

a) Have lost or thrown away the keys to the unspent transaction outputs
b) Have created a locktime'd transaction with a lock time after the
BIP100/101 switchover times
that is more than 100,000 bytes big
c) Have some special relationship with a miner that you trust to still be
around when the transaction
unlocks that would mine the bigger-than-standard transaction for you.

I don't think adding extra complexity to consensus-critical code to support
such an incredibly unlikely
scenario is the right decision here. I think it is more likely that the
extra complexity would trigger a bug
that causes a loss of bitcoin greater than the amount of bitcoin tied up in
locktime'ed transactions
(because I think there are approximately zero BTC tied up in >100K
locktime'ed transactions).


RE: limit size of transaction+parents:  Feature creep, belongs in another
BIP in my opinion. This one
is focused on fixing CVE-2013-2292
