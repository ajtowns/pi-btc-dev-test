I'm not aware of any remaining *tangible* objections to BIP 17 at this point 
(Gavin seems concerned over a theoretical risk-that-nobody-has-thought-of), 
but if there's a better solution, I'm perfectly fine Withdrawing BIP 17 to 
support it.

Both BIP 16 and 17 are backward compatible enough that people can continue to 
use the old clients with each other. An upgrade is only required to send to 
(or create/receive on) the new 3...-form addresses. That being said, it's 
quite possible to rewrite the practical implications of both BIP 16 and 17 in 
the format you seem to be suggesting. Doing so would even get rid of one of 
the major objections to BIP 16 (its inconsistency).
