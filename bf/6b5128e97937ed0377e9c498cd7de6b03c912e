Hi Dan.

What might be better aim is to have built in wipeout protection? In
softfork scenario this would protect a majority threatening a minority
with a wipeout if they do not opt in to some soft-fork consensus
change.


This could be partly done done by having automoated consensus critical
checkpoints, for example at 100 blocks deep. Maybe there are better
ways?


This would in effect turn softforks into hardforks.
