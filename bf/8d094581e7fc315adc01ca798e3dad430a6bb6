Ah, yeah, I think you have a point re: naming - this isn't quite the
traditional honeypot, as we uniquely have the ability to give the attackers a
reward in a way where it's ok for the intruder to know that they've been
detected; with traditional non-monetary honeypots it's quite difficult to come
up with a scenario where it's ok for an intruder to gain something from the
intrusion, so you're forced to use deception instead.

Perhaps a better term for this technique would be a "compromise canary"? Or
"intruder bait"? After all, in wildlife animal research it's common to use bait
as a way of attracting targets to discover that they exist (e.g. w/ wildlife
cameras), even when you have no intention of doing any harm to the animal.
