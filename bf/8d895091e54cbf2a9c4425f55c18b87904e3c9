Back on topic:

I initially misunderstood your proposal. Let me reformulate, and
suggest some names:
* bitcoin-gui (or bitcoin-qt): always starts GUI, optionally starts
RPC server, no RPC client
* bitcoin-server: always starts RPC server, no RPC client, no GUI
* bitcoin-client: always runs RPC client, no RPC server, no GUI

Additionally, we could offer a script or symlinked executable with
names "bitcoin" and
"bitcoind" that detect whether RPC commands are present on the command line, and
based on this invoke either bitcoin-server/bitcoin-gui or
bitcoin-client (for backward
compatibility).
