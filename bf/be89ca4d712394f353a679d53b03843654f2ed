a node that is not doing any checking themselves can not reliably
forward failed verifications without getting the blame for doing faulty
work. Those nodes would then have the incentive not to relay the failed
verifications. This ends up making it important to know which nodes will
be checking transactions or not so you don't isolate yourself from other
nodes that are also checking transactions.
