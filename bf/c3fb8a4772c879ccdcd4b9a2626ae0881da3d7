Matt, you know better than that. Gavin neither lacks clue nor is he
dishonest.

He has been working on the assumption that other developers are reasonable,
and some kind of compromise solution can be found that everyone can live
with. Hence trying to find a middle ground, hence considering and writing
articles in response to every single objection raised. Hence asking for
suggestions on what to change about the plan, to make it more acceptable.
What more do you want, exactly?

And I'll ask again. Do you have a *specific, credible alternative*? Because
so far I'm not seeing one.
