Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Hosting of compiled bitcoin client
Message-ID: <CA+QPp0rDb9cKThWZuvC=OuvKmh4YBWLVAcP6rFjt0g47tLaAoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi team,

Given that sourceforge has shown to restrict access to a number of
countries at the request of the USA, would hosting of the compiled client
on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/downloads be an alternative that
would be considered?

It seems like a logical alternative to me that requires little effort as it
is already in use as the code repository.

Kind regards,

Kyle
