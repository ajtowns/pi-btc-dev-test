That makes sense, to have self-signed certificates as a basic start, but
then is it possible to have a Bitcoin user (address) add reputation/sign
such a certificate, rather than having a central signing authority? If
there was a way for a Bitcoin user to provide feedback on a payment (ECDSA
signature from one of the addresses involved in the payment, signing an
identifier of the payment and a feedback score) such that any user can add
to the reputation with just the Bitcoin infrastructure, without having to
learn X.500 certificate signing on top of EC signatures? If there was a
standard structure for a message to be EC-signed with your Bitcoin client,
and then a distributed store of those signed messages, could that form a
reputation score?
