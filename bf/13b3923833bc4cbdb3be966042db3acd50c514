As I've observed before, Gavin originally advocated either a 99% or
100% buy in by miners for a hard fork to trigger.

I don't understand why people (Gavin included) now seem to favour a
much more modest supermajority except perhaps that they believe that
that level of consensus is unachievable.

FWIW I'm in favour of a block size increase.  I just wish that half as
much energy had gone into discussing whether we want a 100%
supermajority or a 99% supermajority or an 80% supermajority, as has
gone into discussing whether we want 1MB blocks or 8MB blocks or 20MB
blocks.  (So thank you, Pieter, for raising this.)
