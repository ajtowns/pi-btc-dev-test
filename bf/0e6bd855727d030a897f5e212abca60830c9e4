Ok, so again, if that's your security criteria, what's the issue with
soft-forks? With soft-forks, the result of a SPV wallet following the
highest work chain is the same: eventually invalid blocks are reorged
out.

However, because soft-forks make it less likely that a long invalid
chain will be generated, an attacker sybil attacking your SPV wallet has
a much harder time tricking it into accepting a transaction. (they might
get one or two confirmations, rather than dozens)

What's the scenario where soft-forks are worse than hard-forks from a
SPV wallet's perspective?
