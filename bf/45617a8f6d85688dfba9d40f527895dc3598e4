Good morning kim,

This seems to be a specific instance of "covenants".  I believe, that there are vague plans to possibly include OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK, which would allow covenants much more generally, but with more complex (clever) SCRIPT.

The specification of the behavior of the opcode is P2SH-focused and is unuseable for SegWit, but possibly it can instead be made a SegWit-only opcode instead (especially, since, by my knowledge, future plans for SCRIPT updates will generally involve only future SegWit versions).

The specification could be improved as below:

The OP_CHECKTXOUTSCRIPTHASHVERIFY will succeed if either of the below are true for all outputs of the transaction that is spending this SCRIPT:

1.  It is a P2WSH whose SegWit version and hash, when concatenated together, are equal to the stack top.
2.  It is a P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH that is the same as the transaction output being spent.

Otherwise, if any output does not match either of the above, this operation will fail.

Regards,

As a result, the item may also has to be dropped explicitly.* So that change can be sent back to the this redeem script. There are challenges to generalize this as a script hash cause of some cyclic reference. Not sure if cyclic is the correct term, ie: A = hash (B's hash) and B = hash (A's hash) is impossible.

Attacker's transaction submitted before it will be caught by the monitoring function. Even if the above assumption is misguided, the use-case is still useful if transactions have value smaller quantity than total, that limits loss to only the transaction's value. At the same time, that reveals the fact that the key pair is compromised and the further preventive actions can be carried out using the secure key pair.
