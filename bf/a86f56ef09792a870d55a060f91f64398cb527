Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 released
In-Reply-To: <20151113131353.GA26622@amethyst.visucore.com>

Message-ID: <CAGLBAhcMMLnze8N=OLK0EypatRKEhFkHTJDo_KJyc_A1h1d-uA@mail.gmail.com>

I decided to try to certify Wladimir's PGP keys (the old one (2346C9A6)
first, and then the new one (36C2E964), since it was signed with the old
one).

I visited
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/009045.html
to see that the new key was referenced in a message signed by the old one.
I figure it's safe to assume that if the old key actually signed that
message, then the core dev using <laanwj at gmail.com
<https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev>> is an
actual core dev (that's all I'd be worried about).  So I copied the text
from ------BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- to -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- to
my clipboard and asked Kleopatra (on Windows) to verify it.  It says the
signature is bad.  If I alter the text of the email (so the signature would
be have to be different to be valid), it says exactly the same thing.  So
maybe something is wrong with Kleopatra on Windows.

However, the SHA256SUMS.asc file I got from the magnet link posted in the
email (below)  verifies just fine using the new key (36C2E964).  So I
figure Kleopatra is not broken.  It recognizes that the old key was used to
create the signature in that old email, but it says it's invalid.  Has
Wladimir been secretly replaced by someone who doesn't have access to the
private key for 2346C9A6?  Can you make a (bad) signature look like it was
made using a key you don't have? The whole reason for signing is so that we
will know if something like that happened.  So did I do something wrong?
(I mean, besides using Windows).

I believe this is the expected result if someone took something Wladimir
signed and ripped off the signature and pasted it below this new message to
make everyone think the new message was genuine.  Maybe Wladimir made an
edit after the signature was attached.  Or maybe it got changed when it
went through the email system.  It would be nice to know.  Anyway, I fell
back on Windows security and ran the install because it said it verified
that the publisher was "The Bitcoin Foundation".
