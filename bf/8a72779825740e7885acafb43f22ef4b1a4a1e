This discussion sounds to be veering slightly off track.  I think we should
be focusing on how we will ease the transition for new users to get on the
network and use it.  Talking about the necessity and costs of running full
nodes in the future is important, but irrelevant here:  unless we don't
want users who aren't willing to run full nodes, we need to accommodate
users who want to simply "use" the network, not necessarily "support" it.  *I'm
making an assumption here that we want new users whether they use a full
node or not*.  Greg's point looks like it's veering towards "we don't want
to grow the network unless we're going to get more full nodes out of it."
  I'm of the opinion, like Mike Hearn, that the number of full nodes needed
for a healthy network is *not* O(N) in the number of users of the network.
 I expect it to be something more like O(sqrt(N))... or perhaps there's
even an upper limit above which the network gets no benefit, even if all 7
billion humans were using it.  (the bottleneck would be size of blocks and
CPU processing power at that point, not a shortage of full nodes).  Would
we rather have a system that is "full-node-or-nothing" and drive away users
that won't support the network, or accommodate those users with various
gradations of participation?

I believe my proposal for an address-based meta-chain (or something like
it) is *exactly* what is needed in the long run.  It could almost obsolete
this entire discussion.  However, as Greg pointed out there is a long,
treacherous path between the theory I presented, and a working&robust
implementation that can serve as the backbone for future SPV nodes.  I have
every intention to help pioneer that when Armory has other major features
completed (such as multi-sig), but it's not something that we can even
consider in the near- or medium-term as a solution to rely on.  I'd be
surprised if any such solution existed in the next 6-12 months.

I think it is very much in everyone's interest here to encourage new users
to start "using" Bitcoin, even if they don't "support" it.  As long as
there is a convenient channel for interested users to get more information
about the system, the benefits of spending the effort to run a full node,
and the features available in more-advanced clients that they might benefit
from, then I'm not personally concerned about a shortage of full nodes, and
we should carry forward with the idea of promoting SPV nodes for the
really-new users.
