Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Pulling for the 0.5 release
Message-ID: <CABsx9T3JZA4mujRgYRs6APaUtUjC+hkka34rZDq7PQFvz829xQ@mail.gmail.com>

Bright and early Monday morning I plan on pulling changes for the
Bitcoin 0.5 release into tip-of-git. Expect some tip-of-git chaos and
instability, I'm sure there will be issues to work through to move
from wxwidgets to qt for the GUI.

I'd like to have a release candidate ready in a week or two, giving
time for a week or two of testing, and have the 0.5 release available
a month from now, assuming no major show-stopper bugs or network
stability or denial-of-service or security vulnerabilities turn up
between now and then.
