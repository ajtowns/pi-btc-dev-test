Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Core Devs : can you share your thoughts about all
 BIPs on this website ?
Message-ID: <CA+1nnrk1EWd7rhwj91p1rqgGVFgOT4UYq=+Nmq41sHJYmy7YYA@mail.gmail.com>

I created a small website which show a chart of your approvals about
various BIPs (which you must fill by yourself with a signed pgp message)

For each BIP, you can fill if you approve or not, and give comments. (HTML
accepted, so you can link stuff you your posts)

It would help the community a lot, so I hope you will do it !
I'm open to add other important devs, big miners, or other proposal that I
missed.

Please, respond on BTC Talk or github. (I don't read the mailing anymore
because of the spam :( )
