Hardware mining rigs do not need updating - they all are designed to connect directly to a pool and it is the pool that makes all block related decisions. All the miner, or as I prefer to call them hasher, sees is an 80 byte block header and possibly with stratum and getblocktemplate enough other information like a partial merkle tree to roll the extranonce.
