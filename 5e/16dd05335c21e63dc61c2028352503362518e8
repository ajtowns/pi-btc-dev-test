The fastest way to triple Bitcoin capacity is to split the network into
two or three different blockchains. We encourage forks of software, why
are blockchains somehow different?

Yes, this is risky, and probably volatile.

I honestly don't expect lots of people with large amounts of money 
invested (exchanges, financial institutions, etc) to go along with 
something like this, and that say 90% of the wealth with stay concentrated
in whatever chain has the majority SHA256 hashpower.

But as a game-theory excercise to see who's theories actually work?

I highly encourage a real-world test of all these theories.

I would also highly advise finding a simple and robust difficulty adjustment
that occurs every block instead of bitcoin/litecoin's 2016 block use.

I am not necessarily advocating it - just putting it out for discussion. While the downside is that it could permanently split the network, the upside is that it could heap additional pressure on miners to follow the BIP148 chain and ensure a minimally disruptive upgrade. This is pure game theory.

MR POWA would mean BIP148 miners would no longer need to ?hold their nerve? as they would be guaranteed a viable chain and rewarded for their early support.
