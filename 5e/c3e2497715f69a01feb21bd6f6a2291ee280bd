Thanks for letting me know, I didn't remember your patch.

Ugh, yes, propagating all extensions in `addr` messages is not how I
imagined this to work.

But then there would need to be an alternative way to discover nodes
that offer a certain extension. Alas, this moves it from a
straightforward and common sense change to a significant change to the
protocol.
