Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Blitcoin? (Black Hat 2011)
Message-ID: <CAJNQ0svWgFwZrra0gQFpxNLOPXk4RbKygeMUNPEA=k-Wqwa-ZA@mail.gmail.com>

L.S.

Some bitcoin "security vulnerabilities" have been discussed by Dan Kaminsky
at BH 2011, there is one article about this dated yesterday:

http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/2240039221/Black-Hat-2011-Dan-Kaminsky-reveals-network-security-research-topics

The article is very unspecific though. They talk about a tool called
"blitcoin" that "unmasks" both sides of a bitcoin transaction. A google
search also turned up nothing, except some misspellings.

Does anyone have more information?
