Sorry but I fail to see how a linear identity transform between block
size and difficulty would work.

The miner's reward for finding a block is the sum of subsidy and fees:

 R = S + F

The probability that the miner will find a block over a time interval is
inversely proportional to the difficulty D:

 P = K / D

where K is a constant that depends on the miner's hashrate. The expected
reward of the miner is:

 E = P * R

Consider that the miner chooses a new difficulty:

 D' = D(1 + x).

With a linear identity transform between block size and difficulty, the
miner will be allowed to collect fees from a block of size: S'=S(1+x)

In the best case, collected will be proportional to block size:

 F' = F(1+x)

Thus we get:

 E' = P' * R' = K/(D(1+x)) * (S + F(1+x))

 E' = E - x/(1+x) * S * K / D

So with this linear identity transform, increasing block size never
increases the miners gain. As long as the subsidy exists, the best
strategy for miners is to reduce block size (i.e. to choose x<0).
