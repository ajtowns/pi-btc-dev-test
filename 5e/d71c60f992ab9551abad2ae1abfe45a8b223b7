That is true VC investors and people starting companies.  People who 
invest directly in Bitcoin love all this stuff.

A few weeks back a bunch of stories quoting nonsense spouted by Bitcoin 
cultists that Greece can use Bitcoin now as a replacement currency and 
store of value.  The price went about $300 so I sold a bunch of my 
coins.  Now we have these stories that Bitcoin is splitting in 2 and it 
went down to near $200 so I bought them back.

The point is that "developer attacks" have to be taken into 
consideration when discussing these things.
