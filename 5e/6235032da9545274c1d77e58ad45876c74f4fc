There are still many other pull requests that seem to be ready, but perhaps 
those can just as well wait for 0.7 if the 0.6 changes are deemed too much to 
add onto. Here are some that seem to be well-tested, and have been part of 
next-test for a while:
	719 coinbaser (already verbally accepted by Gavin for 0.6 a while ago!)
	568 rpc_keepalive
	565 optimize_FastGetWork
	715 bugfix_client_name
	562 optimize_ToHex

If this affects relaying, it will significantly harm the ability to replace 
the current spammy "green address" scheme with a sensible extra signature 
system. On the miner end, it could significantly harm adoption of such a 
system.

What else do I need to change for this?

I can also confirm I have seen at least one addr.db corruption with this.
