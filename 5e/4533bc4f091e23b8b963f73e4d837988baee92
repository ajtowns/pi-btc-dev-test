You're assuming the seller cares about fairness - why should they? They
offered a price for an asset and someone bought it; exactly which buyer
willing to buy at that price was able to complete the trade is
irrelevant to them. What they do care about is being sure that at
whatever given price they offered 100% of the buyers willing to buy at
that price actually see the offer in a reasonable amount of time - at
the best price the seller will get there will be only a single buyer
after all so you need that solid proof that said buyer was actually able
to get the offer.
