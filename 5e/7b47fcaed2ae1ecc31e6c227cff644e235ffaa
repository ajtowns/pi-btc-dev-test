Assuming Alice is paying Bob with an old style time-locked tx. Under your proposal, after the hardfork, Bob is still able to confirm the time-locked tx on both networks. To fulfil your new rules he just needs to send the outputs to himself again (with different tx format). But as Bob gets all the money on both forks, it is already a successful replay

By doing this policy change simultaneously in both networks, old pre-signed transactions *can not be replayed by anybody but the owner* of the coins (as he must spend them immediately in the child transaction).
