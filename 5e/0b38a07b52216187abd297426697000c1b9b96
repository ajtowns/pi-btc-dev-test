I'm not sure if this has been brought up elsewhere in this thread.

This proposal doesn't seem to be a complete replacement of BIP37: It
doesn't provide a filter for unconfirmed transactions like BIP37 does.

That means that most light clients will continue to use BIP37 even if
they may use this BIP as a supplement. Otherwise users would not get
timely notification of incoming payments any more.
