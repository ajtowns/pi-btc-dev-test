You already are in that boat. If your paper wallet has only the
private key (as 100% of them do today). You'll have no idea what coins
have been assigned to it, or what their TXids are. You'll need to
contact a public index (which isn't a service existing nodes provide)
or synchronize the full blockchain history to find it. Both are also
sufficient for jl2012's (/Petertodd's STXO), they'd only be providing
you with somewhat more data.  If instead, you insist that you'd
already be running a full node and not have to wait for the sync, then
again you'd also be your own archive. In none of these cases do you
lose anything.
