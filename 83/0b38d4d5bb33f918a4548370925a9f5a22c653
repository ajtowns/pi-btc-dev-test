AV software changes all the time, I definitely recall cases where AV got
interested in, eg, web browser caches and ended up corrupting things. But
that might be because it knew the files were written by a web browser.
Lightly frying the contents has the disadvantage of no mmap and no
sendfile() in future. Perhaps an idea to stash in our back pockets if it
turns out to be needed later.
