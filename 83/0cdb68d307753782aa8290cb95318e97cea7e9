This discussion about ordering is absolutely retarded. Once the list fills up, then it won't matter. For now I'm deciding the ordering with Bitcoin-Qt first and the others ordered however. That was nobody can try to game the system (it remains unexploitable).

If there are no objections, then I am going to merge this branch. The forum thread is divulging into a mess all over the place, and this conversation can go on forever discussing the silly fine details:

http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/The_Bikeshed_Anti-PatternProblem:
You suggest creating something new for your hackerspace, like a 
bikeshed.  But now all anyone will discuss is its colour. No bikeshed 
will be built.

Armory & MultiBit, are you OK with that description? I will check with ThomasV about Electrum.
