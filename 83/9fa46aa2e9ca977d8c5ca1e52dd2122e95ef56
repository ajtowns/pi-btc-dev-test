Yes it is allowed in TxOuts. And yes it is designed to save space. But the problem is Bob can?t assume Alice understands the new TxOuts format. If Bob really wants to save space this way, he should first ask for a new BIP173 address from Alice. Never try to convert a P2PKH address to a P2SH or BIP173 address without the consent of the recipient.

From reading the various BIPs it had seemed like Native P2WPKH and Native P2WSH were also valid and identifiable if they were encoded in TxOuts.  The theoretical use case for this would be saving bytes in Txes with many outputs.
