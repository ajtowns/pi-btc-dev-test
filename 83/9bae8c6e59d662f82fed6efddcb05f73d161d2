Hi,

For the less crypto engineering experts but highly interested in Bitcoin
and working with Bitcoin on daily basis reading the list, what would be
an easy to understand explanation about how does this solution represent
a good fix?

So, we have a hard cap of 1 MB block currently. This is not enough
because more and more people use Bitcoin and the transaction volume
increased (yeey, good news). So, rather than fixing the issue for good,
we just increase the block size hard cap to 20 MB. I will not discuss if
this causes problems or not. But what are the future plans, when the 20
MB hard cap will be reached? Increase it again? This doesn't sound like
a fix, it sounds more like pushing the can down the road. Obviously if 1
MB is not enough now, we have the reasonable suspicion that 20 MB could
not be enough in few years.

What is the explanation that 20 MB blocks will be sufficient for life
time? Is it because 'probably other solutions will appear, such as
micropayment channels and offchain transactions'?  If this is the case,
those can easily function with 1 MB blocks as well, and we should see
those in action sooner rather than later.

I run multiple full nodes, including one with Bitcoin XT and I don't
want to see Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core divide into different consensus
and create 2 altcoins instead of one Bitcoin.

As has been discussed on this list and elsewhere: Bitcoin could potentially die due to economic and/or game-theoretic complications arising from raising the block size limit, but Bitcoin could also die due to usability complications arising from NOT raising the block size limit. Strong, personally held opinions by various members of this community notwithstanding, it is not clear which of these scenarios is more likely.

If he has to commit his changes to Bitcoin XT and then rally the miners to switch, then that's what he'll do. He believes that he is working in the best interests of Bitcoin (as I would hope we all do), and so I do not fault him for his intentions. However, I think his proposal is too risky.

If allowing significantly larger blocks will cause a serious problem for Bitcoin (which is a possibility that we cannot rule out, as we lack omniscience), then NOT making any change to Bitcoin Core will virtually *assure* that we cause exactly this problem, as the popular (non-technical) consensus appears to be in favor of Bitcoin XT and a larger block size limit. If we do nothing, then there's a very real chance that Bitcoin XT takes over, for better or worse.

You can argue that, because we'll have plenty of time before March 2016, it's not "sudden," but, whether we do it now or a year from now or a decade from now, a step function is, by definition, sudden.

Both get you to the eventual goal, but one is reckless while the other is measured and deliberate. If there's a problem that larger blocks will enable, then I'd prefer to see the problem crop up gradually rather than all at once. If it's gradual, then we'll have time to discuss and fix it without panicking.
