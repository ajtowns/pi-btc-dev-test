What is the rationale to come on this list (on behalf of we don't know
whom) and explain all the details of the "network upgrade" (ie the
attack) if this is not to try to get some information to confirm the
theory and/or improve it, or some information about how it will be
defeated? This just shows that they are not sure about the whole thing,
they should stop this now, launch their approximative BU if they like
and leave BTC alone
