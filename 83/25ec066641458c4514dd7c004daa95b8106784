The requirement for anonymity and privacy is lawyers and a Bitlicense.

If you want privacy and anonymity, then do high-frequency trading on
a centralized exchange, and if you want to go over-the-top, run some
arbitrage bots as well, and hide in the millions of transactions per
second that go on.

But make sure you get a Bitlicense and have a good securities lawyer.

Trying to solve a legal/legislative/social problem with more crypto is
only going to serve the people who created the legal/legislative/social
problem in the first place, because they can hire a hacker who will 
find a misplaced (} in your crypto code, and all the work you did to
encrypt wire protocols becomes silently worthless.
