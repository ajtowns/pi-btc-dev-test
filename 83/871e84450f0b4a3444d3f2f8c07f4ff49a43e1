Even accepting the premise that policy is pure local fiat, the
conclusion doesn't follow for me. BIPs about best practices or
especially anything where interop or coordination are, I think,
reasonable uses of the process.

E.g. you might want to know what other kinds of policy are in use if
you're to have any hope of authoring transactions that work at all!
