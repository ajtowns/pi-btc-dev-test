Agree, but even before that, we will meet problems of the current 1MB/10min limit.

The calculations from the scalability link surely indicates that there are 2 options for scalability either go for trusted supernodes backed by huge hardware resources or something else would be needed. The supernode approach is simple and easy to implement, but it also breaks a lot of the nice features about bitcoin. So if we want bitcoin to stay p2p we need to deploy other strategies. The hash space partitioning is one of them. And the nice thing is that it can be made to scale even for a javascript based validating and fully connected client running on a smartphone in a bitcoin future with billions of clients and transactions, and still it does not exclude you from running a trusted supernode either. 

Cheers,

M
