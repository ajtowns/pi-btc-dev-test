Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin is an experiment. Why don't we have an
 experimental hardfork?

-> You need to take into account the reward halving, likely to be in
3Q2016. Forks and reward halving at the same time would possibly be a bad
combination.

-> The original proposed date for the fork was December 2015. It was pushed
back to January as December is a busy period for a lot of people and
businesses. Likewise, June is a busy period for people. July / August is a
good period as it is quiet because people go on holiday. A window of 2
months during holiday periods is better than starting in June. January 2016
is better, mainly because of the excessive reward halving chatter likely to
be going on..
