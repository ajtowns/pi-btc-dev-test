 is a lot easier than most people realise

Since no complete solution to preventing 0-confirmation respends in the 
bitcoin network has been proposed, or is likely to exist, when 
evaluating partial solutions let's ask "what kind of network does this 
move toward?"

Does the solution move toward a network with simple rules, where the 
certainty that decreases from the many-confirmations state, down to 1 
confirmation, does not immediately disappear just below the time of 1 
confirmation?

A network where transaction submitters consider their (final) 
transactions to be unchangeable the moment they are transmitted, and 
where the network's goal is to confirm only transactions all of whose 
UTXO's have not yet been seen in a final transaction's input, has a 
chance to be such a network.  If respend attempts are broadcast widely, 
then after a time on the order of transaction propagation time (<< 1 
minute) has passed, participants have a good chance to avoid relying on 
a transaction whose funds are spent to someone else.  This is both 
because after this time the network is unlikely to split on the primacy 
of one spend, and because the recipient, able to see a respend attempt, 
can withhold delivery of the good or service until confirmation.

Or, does the solution move toward a network that
  - Requires participants to have knowledge of the policies of multiple 
entities, like Eligius and whoever maintains the blacklist mentioned below?
  - Requires a transaction submitter to intently monitor transactions 
and try to climb over the top of attempted respends with 
"scorched-earth" triple spends, until a random moment some time between, 
let's say, 5 and 15 minutes in the future?
  - Punts the problem to off-network solutions?
