I should also point out that pretty much all of these suggestions (except for maybe 8) would apply to ANY payment system?they are NOT specific to Bitcoin whatsoever. Any serious payment processor should have these sorts of policies engrained as part of company culture?or else one day (probably not too long from now) you?ll be out of business. The mere suggestion that changing relay policy would pose significant threats to the bottom line of a payment processor is about the height of amateurishness, IMHO.
