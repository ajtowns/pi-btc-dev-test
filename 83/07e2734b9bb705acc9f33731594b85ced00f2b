My first internal version triggered on block 406,800 (~May 5), and each
block increased by 20 bytes thereafter.

It was changed to time, because time was the standard used in years past
for other changes; MTP flag day is more stable than block height.

It is preferred to have a single flag trigger (height or time), rather than
the more complex trigger-on-time, increment-on-height, but any combination
of those will work.

Easy to change code back to height-based...
