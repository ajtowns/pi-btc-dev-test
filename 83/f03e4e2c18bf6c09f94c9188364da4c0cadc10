I have seen this question asked many times.  Most developers become 
defensive and they usually give a very vague 1-sentence answer when this 
question is asked.  It seems to be it is based on personalities rather 
than any kind of definable process.  To have that discussion the 
personalities must be separated out and answers like "such-and-such 
wouldn't do that" don't really do much to advance the discussion.  Also, 
the incentive for new developers to come in is that they will be paid by 
companies who want to influence the code and this should be considered 
(some developers take this statement as an insult when it is just a 
statement of the incentive process).

The other problem you are having is the lead developer does not want to 
be a "decider" when, in fact, he is a very significant decider.  While 
the users have the ultimate choice in a practical sense the chief 
developer is the "decider."  Now people don't want to get him upset so 
nobody wants to push the issue or fully define the process.  Now you are 
left with a broken, unwritten/unspoken process.  While this type of 
thing may work with a small group of developers businesses/investors 
looking in from the outside will see this as a risk.

Until you get passed all the personality-based arguments you are going 
to have a tough time defining a real process.
