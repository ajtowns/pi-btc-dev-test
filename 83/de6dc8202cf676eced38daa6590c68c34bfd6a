Here is one to please those looking for a ?fully qualified? slang word, that links with the official XBT:

xbit (spoken: ex-bit) would rationalise XBT (where X comes from supranational use) and is unique.

I personally associate from x to six also supporting the 1e-6 divisor of Bitcoin.

Regarding XBT: No matter who used it for what. The way Bloomberg will use it will define its use in finance,
and since that did not happen yet, we are not late to shape.

That's fine, but using that as "official" name in software would be very strange and potentially confusing in my opinion. As mentioned by others, that would seem to me like calling dollars "bucks" in bank software. Nobody seems to have a problem with having colloquial names, but "US dollar" or "euro" are far less ambiguous than "bit". I think we need a more distinctive name.
