Hi Andreas,

DHKE will not improve the situation. Either we use a simple method to
transfer a session key or a complex method.

DHKE doesn't offer greater forward secrecy than private transfer of a
session key, in fact it's lesser.

I don't see that there is a dilemma. The current proposal has a
significant privacy problem that can be easily resolved, and the
resolution actually makes the implementation simpler.
