What you describe in this part of your message can be done with no forks 
whatsoever and I think that this is enough. Don't really see the reason for 
any change in funding.

The idea of sending out a block header is essentially what I called 
"optimistic mining" and has been described in more detail in my blog here;

The video explains with graphics too...

You may find this interesting :)
