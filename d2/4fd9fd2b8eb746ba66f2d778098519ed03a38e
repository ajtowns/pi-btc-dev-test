It depends on what software that the general user-base is using (especially
exchanges).  If a majority of miners have deployed a hidden soft fork, then
the soft fork will only last as long as they can maintain their majority.

If they drop below 50%, then the majority of miners will eventually make
and then build on a block that is invalid according to their hidden soft
fork rules.

If the userbase doesn't support a censorship soft fork, then it will only
last as long as a majority of miners support it.  Once the cartel loses its
majority, there is a strong incentive for members to disable their soft
fork rule.  Any that don't will end up mining a lower POW, but valid, chain.

Users updating their nodes to enforce the soft fork is what makes the soft
fork irreversible (without a hard fork).

It's only a hard fork to reverse if the community is enforcing the soft
fork.  Forking off a minority of miners doesn't make it a hard fork.
