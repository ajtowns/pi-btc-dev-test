SegWit txids aren't malleable, but segwit transactions as a whole still are.
For instance, I could mess with a segwit transaction by replacing part of the
witness that is used as an argument to an OP_IF with a much larger push,
potentially making the transaction larger, thus making it not get mined due to
the higher fee. There are also potential legal issues if someone replaces a
push with data where posession in your jurisdiction is illegal.

Having said that, a better approach may be a separate CHECKBOOLVERIFY opcode
that fails unless the top item on the stack is a minimally encoded true or
false value, to allow script writers to opt into this behavior; it's not always
ideal.
