Yeah, that's part of my fundemental disagreement with him: I draw a
sharp line between mining - the act of validating and constructing new
blocks - and hashing - the act of solving proof-of-work problems. The
latter definitely has incentives to decentralize due to simple physics:
it's cheaper per unit hashing power to get rid of a small amount of
waste heat than a large amount. The former requires a full node, and
that full node is a fixed cost overhead related to the number of
transactions per second. Any fixed cost overhead discourages
decentralization, and encourages centralization.

Yup. Quite importantly, the model is for any one miner to be able to
fully participate at the same level as any other miner by mining some
section of the tree. As your reward is linked to blocks mined, there
will always be some level at which you are mining blocks at a reasonably
low variance and you don't need to join a pool to achieve that low
varience. Equally your resources to keep up with that part of the tree
can be made reasonably low, and that cost only grows at the log of the
total transaction volume.
