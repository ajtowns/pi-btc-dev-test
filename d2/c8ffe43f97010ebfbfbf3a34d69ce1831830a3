To be clear, Bitcoin is not a democracy - if you find yourself using the
term "voting" then you may be misunderstanding how consensus forms. Once a
feature has been vetted and the code is deployed, miners may signal that
they are ready to enforce new rules. If for some reason miners are too
"passive or lazy" or wish to "veto" the activation of the new rules, users
may choose to circumvent said veto by refusing to accept blocks that do not
show readiness for enforcing the new rules.

There is a fundamental misconception regarding this point - the white paper
refers to majority hashpower needing to be honest with regard to
determining the correct chain within the context of many possible /valid/
chain forks. It is not referring to using hashpower to determine the
correct chain amongst an infinitely variable number of currently invalid
chain forks. Bitcoin ecosystem participants should not have faith in miners
(or any other entity) when it comes to choosing the consensus rules they
wish to enforce.
