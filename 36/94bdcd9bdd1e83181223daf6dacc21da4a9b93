This is *most likely* the mempool, but is just not reported correctly.

In the meantime you can mitigate the mempool growth by setting `-mintxfee`, see
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0/doc/release-notes.md#transaction-flooding

This will be the default in 0.11.1 and 0.10.3. 0.12.0 will have better mempool management, as well as more precise reporting (as paveljanik already mentions.)
