I quite agree, and I would add that sometimes making yourself
recognisable is far more important that merit.

If we are really going to go for merit, then we probably need to go
all the way back to examine why is it developers and academics think
they need to have money to make code or reputation to do research.

The best code I've written is stuff I've given away for free, although
sometimes I'm able to leverage being recognized for having written 
something into getting paid to write more code. The best research
I've done has been self-funded, when I did not subconsciously have
a funding agent I was trying to please with the outcome of the 
research.

We need a safe space for merit, how about http://gplspace.org/
