> Regarding consensus changes, users can voice their opinion on any number
of communication platforms. Though if you're looking for a way for users to
signal their intentions at the protocol level, every proposal for doing
that to date has been arguably flawed. Measuring meatspace consensus is
pretty tricky if not completely impossible, especially given the fact that
the vast majority of Bitcoin users do not voice any opinions on the matter
of consensus rules.

Most attempts at measuring user consensus would probably be best described
as signaling rather than voting given that the act of doing so has no
actual power to affect consensus. Every user who runs a fully validating
node is free to enforce the rules with which the agree regardless of what
rules other entities are enforcing.
