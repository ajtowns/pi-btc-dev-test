I'd like to know this too.  Is it just that a 4MB blockmaxweight would
theoretically allow ~4MB blocks (if ~all witness data), which is too big?
Or is there a more subtle reason we still need blockmaxsize after a HF?

Why not simply remove the (redundant after sw activation) 1 mb size
limit check and increasing the weight limit without changing the
discount or having 2 limits?
