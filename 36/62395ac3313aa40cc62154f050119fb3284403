Centralized exchanges also allow for things like limit orders.  You don't
even have to be logged in and they can execute trades.  This couldn't be
done with channels.

Using channels and a centralized exchange gets many of the benefits of a
distributed exchange.

The channel allows instant funding while allowing the customer to have full
control over the funds.  The customer could fund the channel and then move
money to the exchange when needed.

Even margin account holders might like the fact that it is clear which
funds are under their direct control and which funds are held by the
exchange.

If they are using bitcoin funds as collateral for a margin trade, then
inherently the exchange has to have control over those funds.  A 2 of 3
system where the customer, exchange and a 3rd party arbitration agency
holds keys might be acceptable to the exchange.
