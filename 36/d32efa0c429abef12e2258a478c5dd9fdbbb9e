Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Build your own nHashType
Message-ID: <CABHVRKTNFoLm9LEO=ctT_UP9zW7QOMQzVXitKC=PAzj=HG9OHg@mail.gmail.com>

Seeking feedback on a proposal that will allow a transaction signer to
explicitly specify what is to be serialized for the signature hash. The
basic idea is to make the nHashType general enough that we won't need a new
sighash flag every time a new use case comes up.

If implemented into bitcoin (via a soft fork), this would make malleability
almost a non-issue (the TXID referenced by inputs just need to be updated
previous TX changes) and would enable hardware wallets to securely sign
without needing to download/process each transaction it spends from.

Please let me know your thoughts.
