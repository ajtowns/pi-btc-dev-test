To be clear Luke, its not THAT complicated to maintain the mining policy,
but preserving the ability of people to place priority based transactions
in a limited mempool world is quite complicated.  See recently closed
#6992.
I think the biggest issue with #6357 is being sure the logic doesn't break
in future changes.  There are a lot of things that need to be updated in
the right order when blocks are connected or disconnected.
And whats the point of having even that added extra complication if its not
easy to place free transactions and starting priority is a decent
approximation for mining anyway (txs can just be rebroadcast in the worst
case).
