We?re currently working with some parties in a supply chain to allow a consumer payment on a retail website to automatically pay supply chain parties, the way BIP70 allows with multiple outputs on a transaction. This behaviour would prohibit this use case.

Hard to say, but here is my last assertion:

- Bitcoin Wallet
- Hive Bitcoin Wallet (checked by source)
- countless (> 300) forks/clones of Bitcoin Wallet

Since you're planning an advanced BIP70 usecase, you'll also have to
deal with the many wallets that don't support BIP70 at all.
