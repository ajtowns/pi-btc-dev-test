FWIW, this attack would effect the current lightning-network "deployable
lightning" design at channel establishment; we reveal our pubkey in the
opening packet (which is used to redeem a P2SH using normal 2of2).

At least you need to grind before replying (which will presumably time
out), rather than being able to do it once the channel is open.

We could pre-commit by exchanging hashes of pubkeys first, but contracts
on bitcoin are hard enough to get right that I'm reluctant to add more
hoops.

Cheers,
Rusty.
