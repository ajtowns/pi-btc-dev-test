The Lightning network is essentially a contract negotiation scheme that rewards cooperation. Defection amounts to either broadcasting early or not responding to signature requests. If done right, either of these situations incurs a bigger cost to the uncooperative party than cooperation. This is why I say blockchains are like a fix to the prisoner?s dilemma.

The blockchain becomes essentially a dispute resolution mechanism and a way to anchor stuff. There?s no use case covered by the current method of ?flood the entire network and confirm on blockchain? that can?t be covered by a method of ?participate in a contract which guarantees me payment on the blockchain if anyone is uncooperative but which rarely requires touching the blockchain? methinks.
