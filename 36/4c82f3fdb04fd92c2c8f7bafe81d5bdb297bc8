Suppose that you've solved a block Z (weak or not) and you want to
propagate it using a previous weak block Y. With "efficient differential
transmission", I assume that you refer to the transmission of the
differences between Y and Z to a peer? What encodings are discussed? I
guess IBLTs are a hot candidate, but are there other schemes in the making?
I suppose that sending something like "weak block Y plus transactions A, B,
C minus transaction ids h(D), h(E)" is not considered an efficient
differential transmission. Then that's part of the answer to my question.

"the size sent is proportional to the improvement you get when finding a
block." - This encapsulates the issue quite well! The more exotic block I'm
building, the more I would benefit from publishing a weak block, but my
weak block would also be larger.

Makes perfect sense. Also, if I'm working on an exotic block, the
probability of someone extending my weak block would be low-ish, so I'm not
necessarily "giving away fast propagation times to someone else" as I first
thought.

Thank you very much for your explanation.
