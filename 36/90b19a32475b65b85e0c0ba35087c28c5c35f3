These parties wouldn't generally consider themselves attackers? nor
would many users (presumably everyone who mines on ghash.io, for
example)? rather they'd they may consider someone using hashpower
voting to reassign coins to be an attacker, and reassigning their
coins instead to be a morally justified and pragmatic response.

I think we're capable here of discussing the specifics without needing
to use generalizations which invite definitional arguments... I don't
think that bombastic language like doomed helps the dialog.
