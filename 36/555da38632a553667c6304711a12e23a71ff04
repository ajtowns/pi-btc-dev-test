If all users abandon the old rules, why would asicboost miners continue to
spend energy on a chain that everybody else is ignoring?

Why?
No, this proposal, for example, may make patented asicboost hardware
obsolete.
I don't accept this claim as true, this is just your opinion.

What do you mean by "embrace" in the context of a patented optimization
that one miner can prevent the rest from using?
