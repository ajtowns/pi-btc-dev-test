Sergio Demain,

You and I have had our altercation, in private, about your assumptions
of authority in this community. That was fine when you told me "for
fuck's sake" on IRC. I'm a man and I made you see your error and
apologize for your trespass.

Now, you present me and the list with an interpretation of some higher
goal that an obviously low-level participant, Mike Hearn, is actioning
here.

No. What you espouse is not what Hearn had premeditated. It all
happened in your mind. "Agent" (quoting popular media) Hearn is a
compulsive contrarian and has a verifiable track record of opposing
and arguing against consensus wherever he endevors. According to
Snowden, he did harm to the public and to colleagues vis-a-vis NSA
surveillance while he held office at Google and he is doing the same
via XT. He is no longer at Google - supposedly by free will. I would
venture, from his own stated goals, that he is in Bitcoin in search of
a salary, even though he displays a fundamental lack of understanding
of Open Source methodology and ideology. And a misconception of
Bitcoin's ability to scale.

The self-proclaimed glory of bitcoinj is a false and empty claim. I
have had to code my nodes to ignore bitjoinj because of its disregard
for protocol policy. For numerous reasons they are more of an irritant
than a positive presence on the network.

You, Lerner, not having an issue with his fallacious position and
actions, speaks about you, too. But you "have nothing for or against
Mike personally" so he's just another participant, regardless of his
behavior and track record, then you give him a thumbs up? Many, maybe
a majority, including Satoshi, have expressed deplorement of O'Hearn
and Andresen. With or without Satoshi you can see the terminal
consensus breach these two populists had engaged in for yourself.
Please answer me and the list how their action does not warrant
rejection from the community?

Yet, for the rest of list members: Agent Hearn, a known co-operative,
shows up with challenges and you respond as if to an equal? A former
head-man, before things fell apart, now an accomplice of Agent Hearn,
Andresen, sprays criticism and you dutifully answer, as if to a Big
Man? Who is he? That self-proclaimed grumpy old-timer? "Run to Google
benchmarks" and there you go. Google? Come on! This is the man who
broke the fundamental consensus rule and now he's got you introducing
Google dependencies into Bitcoin? You're OK with that? Go to XT, you
won't find me or anyone in the community objecting to you and Gavin
playing with Google and all sorts of prefab code there.

Sergio, don't presume to tell me or the list what another man is
saying or what rhythmless jive he's playing. Like everyone here, I
have eyes to see and a mind to comprehend: Hearn is not capable of the
double-play you imply. Nor are you, for that matter. So, thanks for
cutting the cake and showing your true colors, but best you don't
speak for someone else. Speak for yourself so everything is clear and
allegiances don't taint you and whatever you may want to speak, for
yourself, later.
