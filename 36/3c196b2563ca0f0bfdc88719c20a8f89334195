Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP43 Purpose code for voting pool HD wallets
Message-ID: <53F38542.2000704@monetas.net>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

We'd like to reserve two purpose codes for the HD multisig structure
that will be used for the Bitcoin wallets used for voting pools, so
we've documented the structure in the form of two BIPs. One is used
for the wallets suitable for storing bulk bitcoin deposits, the other
is used for storing colored coin deposits.

The primary difference is that bulk deposit wallets use cold storage
and are allowed to incur significant administrative overhead, where as
colored coin wallets do not use cold storage because they must be
capable of being generated on the fly.

Two draft information BIPs are attached.
