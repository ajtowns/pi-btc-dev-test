Are you sure this is Qt 4.6 at all? Not Qt 4.7?

I'd expect *much* more symbols if this was a Qt 4.8 versus 4.6
conflict. Qt 4.7 introduced a lot of new things (see all the
occurences of  #if QT_VERSION >= 0x040700 - things like
setPlaceHolderText would be expected to pop up too), but 4.8 did not.

Can you check?
