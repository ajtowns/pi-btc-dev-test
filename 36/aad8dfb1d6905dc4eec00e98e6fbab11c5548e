Oops, sorry I missed that.

Since that's the reason this proposal exists, I would consider putting
it right up top where people can see it. Also, since this proposal is
specifically designed for multi-sig, I would look at what BIP45 is
doing and maybe incorporate a "cosigner_index" branch. Otherwise, this
idea seems like a reasonable way to organize a wallet.
