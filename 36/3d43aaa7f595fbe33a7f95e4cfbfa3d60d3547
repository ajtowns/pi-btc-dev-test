Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Membership disabled due to bounces
Message-ID: <CAJ2OvpjqmVDamKsUvunOkSoLutk3i2TqXwVUJs_zfxWYgCz+2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I got a message saying that my membership in the list was disabled due to
excessive bounces.  As far as I can remember,  I've only ever sent out one
e-mail on the list (not including this one) and that was a few weeks ago.
Has anyone else seen this problem?  Could this be related in some way to
the issues regarding source forge and the mail list hosting issue?
