Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Icon licenses
Message-ID: <201111151954.58877.luke@dashjr.org>

As you noticed, we replaced most of the icons with license issues in
Bitcoin-Qt... but I intentionally did NOT replace the ones you created, 
assuming you would be willing to relicense them under the MIT (or similar) 
license. Could you commit a license change for these icons, ideally before 
0.5.0 final, please?

Luke
