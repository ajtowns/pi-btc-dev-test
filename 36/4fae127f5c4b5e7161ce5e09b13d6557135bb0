Yes, we sort the keys at each address as well.  But this isn't about key
sorting, it's about assigning each device a different branch of the BIP 32
tree to avoid accidental address re use and to make it self evident which
devices were used for each transaction in the overall wallet history.  I
only suggested sorting the root public keys as a way to assign which
internal/external pair of chains the device should use.

@Justus... Looking at the links you sent I'm not clear how it is related.
And naming it "key voting pools" seems unrelated to why we are proposing
this scheme.  I'll need more than naked links to understand (I'm not saying
it isn't related, I'm just not seeing the connection)
