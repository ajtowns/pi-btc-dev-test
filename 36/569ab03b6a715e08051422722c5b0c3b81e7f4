Without my got-tired-of-waiting-for-someone-to-merge-it coinbaser branch, 
anything modifying the coinbase is hard to implement.

Rather, I would suggest a 20 byte keyhash, which allows the owner to broadcast 
a full URI out-of-band.

How about a simple prefix to the fixed-size keyhash?
Perhaps "MFR=" (Mining Fee Rules)

I would recommend miners use https, with a specified SSL keyhash in the URI 
(so we don't need to pay for a "proper" SSL cert).

Clients should simply be required to follow the relevant HTTP specification.

text/plain and text/html are just wrong and don't make any sense here.

Bitcoin isn't "the web", it's a complicated script-based cryptocurrency.
Everything in the Bitcoin protocol requires a computer's interpretation for 
humans, and there's no reason to stray from this default. Also, JSON is not 
extensible in any of the ways needed for this specific purpose.

Last Modified and other caching rules are dealt with in the relevant HTTP 
specification...

While it doesn't make sense to give it the full legal force of a contract, I 
think it should be expressed as a "MUST" in the BIP.

The coinbase advertisement MUST be part of every coinbase mined by the miner, 
or there's no reliable way to prove which blocks are theirs.
