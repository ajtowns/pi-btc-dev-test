I think that's correct, but my ECC math is a bit shakey... In any case,
what's important is that you can derive a pubkey such that only the
recipient has the privkey, and without knowledge of the shared secret
you can't determine what the recipients master pubkey was.

Yup, you're understanding matches mine. (no guarantee if my
understanding is correct!)

Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention it in my first write-up but you can
easily make stealth addresses include a second pubkey for the purpose of
the communication that either isn't used in the scriptPubKey at all, or
is part of a n-of-m multisig. (n>=2) Interestingly that also means you
can give a third-party that key and out-source the effort of scanning
the blockchain for you.
