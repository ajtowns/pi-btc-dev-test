I am advising not to use any other language than English for BIP39. I
got persuaded to allow more languages when writing BIP39 spec, but I
learned that it was something I should've been more persistently against.

I am currently drafting a new standard[1] which will allow also Shamir
Secret Scheme Splitting and there we disallow usage of a custom wordlist
in order to eradicate this mess. Will try to push this as BIP too once
we get it to the point we are OK with the contents.
