Yes, I agree for most contract purposes CTLV is what you want to be
using, instead of refund transactions beyond being more clearly
correct, it shrinks the protocol state machine by one step.

Though BIP62 also achieves the secondary goal of making required
implementation behaviour more explicit (e.g. the parts enforced in all
transactions), and that shouldn't be discounted.

They're somewhat orthogonal, somwhat complementary things.
