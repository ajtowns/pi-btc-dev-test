Actually I read the paper now as it was linked somewhere else also, and its
quite good.  So now I can summarize it:

Its a writeup of bitcoin in 29 pages, which covers things in the original
bitcoin paper but with more detail of formats, scripts with some examples,
formats etc.  Quite nice paper, concise presentation of many bitcoin details
that are otherwise hard to put together, requiring examining source or
asking people knowledgeable at algorithm/code level.
