I think you mean  <p> CHECKSIGVERIFY <n> CLTV, but this works only for simple script. Most likely you need a DROP if you use IF or CODESEPARATOR.

However, if we change the rule from ?one true stack item? to ?empty stack?, CLTV/CSV popping stack will make more sense. So I think either we change all, or change nothing.

The ?true stack item? and CLTV/CSV as NOP are tech debt. Fixing them in new script version makes script creation easier and sometimes cheaper, but the fix itself creates further tech debts in the code. So I don?t have strong opinion on this topic.
