Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Serialised P2SH HD chains
Message-ID: <201412041542.44207.luke@dashjr.org>

Is anyone working on a serialisation format to convey P2SH HD chains? For 
example, to give someone who wants to make recurring payments a single token 
that can be used to generate many P2SH addresses paying to a multisig script.

I'm thinking of something along the lines of a simple series of tokens, each 
indicating either a HD chain or literal script content. For all HD chains in 
the data, a child key would be generated based on the payment number, and all 
tokens concatenated to form the P2SH serialised script. Eg, for a simple 2-
of-2, you would do something like this:
    literal(OP_2) HDChain HDChain literal(OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG)
Does this sufficiently cover all reasonable use cases?

Luke
