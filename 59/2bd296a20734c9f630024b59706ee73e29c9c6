Without knowing how they're getting created it's hard to say what the
damage is...  are they being created by people using old cached JS
transaction generators? If so? the harm is insignificant. Are they
being created by hardware wallets with the keys baked inside that
can't be changed?  If so? the harm would be more significant.

I think the latter is unlikely right now? but if the network doesn't
stop relaying these transactions it seems inevitable.

In all cases these transactions can be currently be mutated to an
acceptable form? the malleability being one of the arguments for
removing support for non-canonical encodings.  So we could easily post
a transaction normalizer tool that someone with unrelayable
transactions could pass their transactions through to fix them, even
without coming to the developers for help.
