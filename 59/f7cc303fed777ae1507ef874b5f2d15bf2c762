My suggestion would be that we replace OPL as an allowed license with one 
or two Creative Commons licenses. Following the suggestion from the OPL 
creators themselves.
According to Wikipedia;

I'd suggest saying that "Share alike" is required and "Attribution" is 
optional.

Executive summary; give the user the choice (next to public domain) between 
CCO and BY-SA
