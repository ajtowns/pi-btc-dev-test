Is there any incentive for miners to pick segwit transactions over
non-segwit transaction.  Do they require less, equal, or more compute to
process?

We can?t ?just compute the Transaction ID the same way the hash for signing

are 6 (actually 256) ways to hash a transaction.

Also, changing the definition of TxID is a hardfork change, i.e. everyone
are required to upgrade or a chain split will happen.

It is possible to use ?normalised TxID? (BIP140) to fix malleability issue.
As a softfork, BIP140 doesn?t change the definition of TxID. Instead, the
normalised txid (i.e. txid with scriptSig removed) is used when making
signature. Comparing with segwit (BIP141), BIP140 does not have the
side-effect of block size increase, and doesn?t provide any incentive to
control the size of UTXO set. Also, BIP140 makes the UTXO set permanently
bigger, as the database needs to store both txid and normalised txid

Why change the format at all? Why cant we just compute the Transaction ID
the same way the hash for signing the transaction is computed?
