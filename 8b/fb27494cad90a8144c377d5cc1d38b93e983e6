Out of curiosity, what is the technical reason a normal ECC-enabled 
smart-card cannot be used for the hardware signing component of a wallet 
app? (Since if it can, its standardization must have been discussed.)

Debian wiki gives a list of such cards with related opensource software 
to access them.
