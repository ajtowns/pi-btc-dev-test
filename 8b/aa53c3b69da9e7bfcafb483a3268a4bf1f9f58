If Alice still has full control, she is already protected by my proposal, which does not require any protecting child transaction.

But in many cases she may not have full control. Make it clearer, consider that?s actually a 2-of-2 multisig of Alice and Bob, and the time locked tx is sending to Bob. If the time locked tx is unprotected in the first place, Bob will get all the money from both forks anyway, as there is no reason for him to renegotiate with Alice.
