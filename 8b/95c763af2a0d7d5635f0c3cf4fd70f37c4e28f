Hi Brooks,

I've been already thinking about eat -> cat typing mistake. Actually there
may be simplier solution than having wordlist with duplicated words.
Because there's already a mapping of similar characters in the source code
(currently only in unit test, but it can be moved), when user type a word
which isn't in wordlist, application may try to use such mapping to find a
combination which actually is in the mapping. This may be disambiguous in
some cases, but giving a choice between few words may be better than hard
fail. And it is actually quite easy to implement. Although I think
application can do such smart suggestions and help user to recover badly
written mnemonic, I don't think it is necessary to standardize such method
directly into BIP. It may or may not be implemented by developers and it is
just nice to have feature.

Example:

user type ear, but it isn't in wordlist.

Regards the mapping,
E is similar to A, C, F, O
A is similar to E, C, O
R is similar to B, P, H

So application can calculate combinations of possible characters:

a) when app consider than the the user mistyped only one character
AAR, CAR, FAR, OAR
EER, ECR, EOR
EAB, EAP, EAH

b) when app consider than user maybe mistyped more characters, it may do
full combination matrix
AEB,  ACB, AOB,  ... OEH, OCH, OOH

and then ask user to select only these combinations which are actually
presented in the wordlist. In this particular case it may be only CAR or
FAR (both cannot be in the wordlist because of rules in similarity).
