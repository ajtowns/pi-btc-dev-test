The format for "mempool" packet is missing. I'm guessing that it is an empty message, right?

Might be good to add that.

Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 35: add mempool message

Consensus was we should do a BIP for all P2P changes, so here it is...
feedback requested.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0035

Abstract
-------------------------------------------
Make a network node's transaction memory pool accessible via a new
"mempool" message.? Extend the existing "getdata" message behavior to permit
accessing the transaction memory pool.


Motivation
-------------------------------------------
Several use cases make it desireable to expore a network node's transaction
memory pool:
* SPV clients, wishing to obtain zero-confirmation transactions sent or
? received.
* Miners, downloading existing network transactions after a restart.
* Remote network diagnostics.


Specification
-------------------------------------------
1) Upon receipt of a "mempool" message, the node will respond
?  with an "inv" message containing MSG_TX hashes of all the
?  transactions in the node's transaction memory pool.

?  An "inv" message is always returned, even if empty.

2) The typical node behavior in response to an "inv" is "getdata".

?  However, the reference Satoshi implementation ignores requests
?  for transaction hashes outside that which is recently relayed.

?  To support "mempool", an implementation must extend its "getdata"
?  message support to querying the memory pool.

3) Feature discovery is enabled by checking two "version" message attributes:

?  a) Protocol version >= 60002
?  b) NODE_NETWORK bit set in nServices


Backwards compatibility
-------------------------------------------
Older clients remain 100% compatible and interoperable after this change.


Implementation
-------------------------------------------
See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1641
