For some time now the relation between block size and propagation speed has 
been decoupled. Using xthin/compact blocks miners only send a tiny version 
of a block which then causes the receiving node to re-create it using the 
memory pool.  Immediately getting double benefits by including pre-verified 
transactions from the memory pool you avoid the old problem of having to 
validate them again when a block was mined.

As such there is no downside to a miner creating a bigger block, as long as 
all the transactions they include are actually in the mempool.

As such I'm personally convinced that the problem you are trying to solve 
has already been solved.

Cheers!
