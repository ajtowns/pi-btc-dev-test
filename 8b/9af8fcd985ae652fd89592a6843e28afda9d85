Yeah, my public nodes currently have 2200+  Over time, it gets
cluttered naturally due to the disconnect between what miners mine and
what relayers relay.

I've long argued that all mempool implementations should limit the
lifetime of any TX to a specific number of blocks.  Rationale:
- bitcoin clients retransmit until TX is confirmed
- provides a deterministic lifetime for a TX; if you KNOW a TX will
disappear 144 blocks (24 hours) after you stop transmitting, then it
is probably safe to initiate recovery procedures and perhaps revise
the transaction
- prevents zombie TXs from littering memory... they hang around,
wasting resources, but never get confirmed

No one has strenuously argued against this, so I suppose it is down to
writing a patch, and coming up with a good number we (as a network)
can agree upon.
