Matt: That's a good point. I'll do up a chart comparing utxo size at each
block, as well as comparing over-the-wire size for each block. I think the
period of coalescing earlier this year should be a good example of what
you're describing.

Greg: heh, I was wondering how long it would take for someone to point out
that I'm cheating. I avoided using the word "compression", mostly to
side-step having the discussion turning into reworking the wire
serialization. But you're absolutely right, the de-duping benefits are
independent of the UHS use-case.
