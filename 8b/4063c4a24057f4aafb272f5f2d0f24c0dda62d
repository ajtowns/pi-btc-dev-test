Bram Cohen,

In R&D: First its appropriate to explore all interesting ideas, and help each other improve their ideas. Last, when there is a deadline that needs to be met, we compare various options and decide on which to go with.

I'm on the First step still.

If you really want to push me to saying it, I'm not a fan of the Patricia Tree for bitcoin txos. I think its too much work for everyone to do when other options are available. But I'm not trying to say that your design is bad or wont work... I'm just personally not interested in it at this time.

Cheers,
Praxeology Guy
