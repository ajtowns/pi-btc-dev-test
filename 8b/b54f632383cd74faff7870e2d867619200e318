Please add known good/bad pools here:

    https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Comparison_of_mining_pools#SPV_Mining_.2F_Old_Bitcoin_Core

I will update the Bitcoin.org alert to point there.

We're especially in need of information about pools that are still SPV
mining so that we can make accurate guesses about how many additional
confirmations are needed while the situation persists.

Thank you,
