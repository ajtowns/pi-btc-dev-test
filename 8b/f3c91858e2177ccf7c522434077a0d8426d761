That's good - what I had taken away from the replace-by-fee discussions was
that it was finally decided.

My opinion is that we should be doing what we can to make 0-confs as
reliable as possible - which will always be 'not very', but a solid system
to notify on attempted double-spends is a good start.

I'd like to know how Peter Todd's experiment with the 2BTC reward has gone.
