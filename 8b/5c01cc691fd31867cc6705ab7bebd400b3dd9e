I thought he was proposing a new consesnsus rule. I see, this would be just
a policy validation that everybody would be free to ignore (like the "first
seen" spend conflict tx replacement policy).

I don't see how miners would benefit from running this policy so I would
not expect them to run it in the long run (like the "first seen" spend
conflict tx replacement policy).
If miners don't use it, I don't see how users can benefit from running that
policy themselves.
They will still have to keep waiting some block confirmation to
exponentially reduce the chances of a successful double-spend attack with
each new confirmation (as explained in the bitcoin white paper).

How do you know which of 2 blocks with the same height is "newer"?
