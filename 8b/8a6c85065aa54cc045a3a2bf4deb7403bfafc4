Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Address expiration times should be added to
	BIP-173

I think we need something like this. Hour resolution seems like the
correct choice to me.

Please someone steal whatever code you can from this PR when
implementing the UI for BIP173 expiration:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9722

I have a rebased version as well if anyone wants it.
