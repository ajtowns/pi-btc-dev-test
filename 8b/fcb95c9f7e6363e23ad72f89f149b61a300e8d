The BIP 62 approach to malleability isn't the only option. Another
approach is to sign the transaction in such a way that the input
txid's are allowed to change without invalidating the signatures. That
way, if malleability happens, you just adjust you transaction to match
and re-broadcast. That proposal is here:

https://github.com/scmorse/bitcoin-misc/blob/master/sighash_proposal.md

The "Build your own nHashType" thread on this mailing list contains
the discussion.

I personally prefer this solution, since it nails the problem
completely with one simple and obvious change. The BIP 62 approach is
more like a game of wac-a-mole.
