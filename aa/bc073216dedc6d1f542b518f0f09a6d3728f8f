Block header has to be available in SPV and also in an UTXO only storing core node, so why not serve it if bandwith allows.

Serving any additional information like known peer adresses or known full blocks is certainly beneficial and should be offered if at hand.

It helps provide redundancy in the network topology and helps provide more resources for full nodes to sync up faster. For instance in a network with a large number of partial UTXO set nodes if those nodes are forwarding block data to each other they can get enough data to become fully fledged full nodes without putting all the load on the existing full nodes.  This is a good thing.
