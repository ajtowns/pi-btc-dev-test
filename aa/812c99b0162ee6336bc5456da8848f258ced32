The point with UTXO is in the long run to be able to switch from a p2p network where everyone stores, validates and verifies everything to a DHT where the load of storing, validating and verifying can be shared. 

If we succeed with that then I don't see a problem in a growing set of UTXO, may that be due to abuse/misuse or just massive use. A properly designed DHT should be able to scale to this.

However, that being said, if you worry about the size of the UTXO set you should change the current coin choosing algorithm to simply get rid of dust. 

The current algorithm (ApproximateBestSubset) tend to accumulate dust as dust tend to be on an other scale than a real transactions and hence it is never included.

Regarding the demurrage/escheatment road, I agree that this is for another project. However, if users/developers like this idea, they can just implement a coin choosing algorithm donating dust as miner fee and use it on their satoshi-dice polluted wallet ;)

However, it would completely destroy confidence in Bitcoin, as far as I can see. It makes sense economically, but it  isn't feasible if we want to maintain people's confidence in Bitcoin.
