That's also possible through the RPC. See "getnettotals". You can also
get stats per peer in "getpeerinfo".

I also suggest looking at Jameson Lopp's Statoshi work
(http://statoshi.info) if you like graphs and more detailed stats.

Yes, such a document would be very welcome.

Maybe coordinate with Sa?vann Carignan or David Harding, it could be
part of their bitcoin documentation project.

I agree with you that a default configuration file is useful,
*however* this does not need to be created by the daemon.

The idea would be to make bitcoind and its data and configuration
system-wide. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4124

A daemon should not even have write access to its own configuration
files. To follow the example of apache, tor, and such the distribution
installs a default configuration file which the user can adapt.

This sounds good, but as usual the practice is much uglier.

Bitcoind was part of the Ubuntu default repos for a while, but they
don't upgrade versions as we need to. This resulted in Ubuntu 12.04
stable being stuck with 0.3.xx forever. It would be even worse for
Debian Stable, which has even older versions of packages.

So right now we need you to add the PPA to get the package for Ubuntu.
This is only a small extra step.

This has to be determined per distribution, though. In some distros
this may be perfectly possible. This is just another place where the
project is completely dependent on volunteers.

Sounds like a fun project for someone in Python. Most of the
information is already available through RPC (and if not, request
it!).

Some hacking with ncurses could quickly make a decent tool here. It
could be packaged with bitcoin itself but that's not necessary. For
example Tor has the tool 'arm' which is a separate package.

You may want to talk with Shawn Wilkinson he has some ideas in this
direction. See also the issue
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3122 .

Running the node without wallet is already possible since 0.9.0 in two ways:

- ./configure --disable-wallet when compiling
- run with -disablewallet  (as you say)

This works both for the GUI and the daemon. You can use the resulting
node-only instance ("edge router") with any existing SPV wallet.

There are plans to split off the wallet so that it can run separately,
but I wouldn't be holding my breath.

It feels to me that the general direction things are going in is that
other wallet projects are advancing much faster than Bitcoin Core's
wallet and people will likely switch to other wallet projects for
wallet functionality. Bitcoin Core is moving to an edge router role.

I'm happy to be proven wrong here and would like to see someone work
on bitcoind's wallet, but with the current development resources we
have to focus on a what is most urgent: maintaining and improving the
infrastructure.

Yes, it would be great of connectivity and proxy problems were
signaled in some way.

Detecting whether your port is closed from the outside is an imprecise
art at most, though, as it relies on information from others.

A first step could be showing the number of incoming and outgoing
connections separately in getnetworkinfo. If you have no incoming
connections after a while you can be fairly sure that there is no
outward connectivity.

What incentive do peers have to reconnect to you specifically? The
nature of a P2P network is that nodes are interchangeable. If a node
fails or kicks them, they'll just try the next node in the list.
Sometimes that will be you, sometimes it will not.
