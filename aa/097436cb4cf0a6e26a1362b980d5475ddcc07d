Well, the major difference is that you could sign up effortlessy to a
service, and associate your email later.
If more people sign up to more services, it's a good thing for the
ecosystem.

In a perfect world, you would pay your locker with a "normal" transaction.
The same way you shouldn't play satoshi dice from a shared wallet.

But your point is totaly valid, and I don't have answer to that except that
I'd love to have a Bitcoin authenticated locker in our Bitcoin co working
office.

Bitcoin users are normaly already paying some effort to securise and backup
their wallets / keys. So it's just about leveraging that.

I would myself pick a crypto locker, because I'm the kind of guy who
Facebook connects and I follow the easiest path, even if it has long term
costs :)
