How?

I ran some simulations, and I could not find a network topology where a big
miner producing big blocks could cause a loss of profit to another miner
(big or small) producing smaller blocks:

(the 0.3% advantage I DID find was for the situation where EVERYBODY was
producing big blocks).

Why 2 MB ?   You said that server bandwidth is much more expensive in
China; what would be the difference in your bandwidth costs between 2MB
blocks and 20MB blocks?
