I?m trying to understand the collision attack that you're explaining to Tom Zander.  

Mathematica is telling me that if I generated 2^32 random transactions, that the chances that the initial 64-bits on one of the pairs of transactions is about 40%.  So I am following you up to this point.  Indeed, there is a good chance that a pair of transactions from a set of 2^32 will have a collision in the first 64 bits.  

But how do you actually find that pair from within your large set?  The only way I can think of is to check if the first 64-bits is equal for every possible pair until I find it.  How many possible pairs are there?  

It is a standard result that there are 

    m! / [n! (m-n)!] 

ways of picking n numbers from a set of m numbers, so there are

    (2^32)! / [2! (2^32 - 2)!] ~ 2^63

possible pairs in a set of 2^32 transactions.  So wouldn?t you have to perform approximately 2^63 comparisons in order to identify which pair of transactions are the two that collide?

Perhaps I made an error or there is a faster way to scan your set to find the collision.  Happy to be corrected?

Best regards,
Peter
