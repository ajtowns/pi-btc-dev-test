Several times. It's been debated if unconfirmed transactions are 
necessary, methods of doing more private filtering have been suggested, 
along with simply not filtering unconfirmed transactions at all. My 
collected data suggests that there is very little use of BIP37 at 
present, based on incoming connections to nodes I know end up in the DNS 
seed responses (no "SPV" clients do their own peer management).
