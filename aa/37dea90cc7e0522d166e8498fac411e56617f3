Ciphrex CoinVault (https://ciphrex.com) is currently using parallel trees with lexicographic sorting of keys.

CoinVault is also using a partially signed transaction format whereby 0-length placeholders are used for missing signatures in the transaction scripts. Once all the required signatures to satisfy the policy are present, the remaining zero-length placeholders are removed so the transaction can be broadcast to the network. These partially signed transactions can be shared with other parties to an account or other signing devices for the purpose of requesting additional signatures.

Just like Jean-Pierre mentioned, we'll be using parallel trees to generate P2SH addresses after sorting the keys lexicographically.  We plan to introduce the concept of a wallet "bundle" (that name is far from concrete... I'd love a better word).  All wallets in a bundle are protected by the same backup, and stored in the same file.  The default behavior will be use new branches in the same BIP32 tree when a user creates a new "wallet", though we will allow multiple bundles in advanced and expert usermode (which is needed to have watching-only wallets from a different seed created from an offline computer).

We feel this is critical, as it allows for linked wallets in which there was never a single-point of failure from key-generation to signing.  This is especially important for contexts where employees may be handling a company's Bitcoins wallets.

I was not clear whether those BIPs were worth prioritizing ... i.e. is there a general consensus from a variety of wallet developers that they should be supported?  Rather, I'm happy to start prioritizing them if others do too, but I haven't spent much time trying to understand them to even know if they're mature, yet.
