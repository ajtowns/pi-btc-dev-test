Yes, they lose their work, but that's irrelevant: what's important is
eventually Alice runs out of secret blocks and then has no advantage
over the other miners.

In your paper Alice created her lead by exploiting the fact that not all
of the hashing power was working to extend the same block due to the
"first-wins" rule. With my solution that situation doesn't happen in the
first place: forks are resolved quickly because both sides have both
forks, and consensus on which one is the winner is achieved very quickly
by proving which side has the majority of hashing power through
near-target PoW solutions. With the majority of hashing power in
consensus and working to extend the same block there's nothing Alice can
do to get ahead, defeating the attack.
