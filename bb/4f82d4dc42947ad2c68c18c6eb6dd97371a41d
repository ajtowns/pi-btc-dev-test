I think you'll find that writing in that tone makes one come across as a
complete and utter douchebag.

I suspect what you're intending to do is to use faux-polite
condescension to bait me into responding in a way to will justify my
subsequent banning from this mailing list so that the people who aren't
interested in answering certain uncomfortable questions will have a
plausible excuse for preventing them from being asked here.

Actually there's been 3+ years of stonewalling, deception, conflicts of
interest, and outright crimes, which have been generally ignored by
those who are desperately attempting to assume good faith.

The purpose of my email was to remind everyone that nobody is going to
get away with avoiding ownership of the consequences of their actions.

If the network experiences a painful upgrade because six months of time
that could have been used to prepare a smooth upgrade was lost, the
individuals who squandered that time own the result. They can't get
around it by demanding six additional months, as if they had nothing to
do with the six lost months.
