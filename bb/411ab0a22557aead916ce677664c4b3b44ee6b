Hi Erik,

As you know:

1. If a sidechain is merged mined it basically grows out of the existing
Bitcoin mining network. If it has a different PoW algorithm it is a new
mining network.
2. The security (ie, hashrate) of any mining network would be determined
by the total economic value of the block. In Bitcoin this is
(subsidy+tx_fees)*price, but since a sidechain cannot issue new tokens
it would only be (tx_fees)*price.

Unfortunately the two have a nasty correlation which can lead to a
disastrous self-fulfilling prophecy: users will avoid a network that is
too insecure; and if users avoid using a network, they will stop paying
txn fees and so the quantity (tx_fees)*price falls toward zero, erasing
the network's security. So it is quite problematic and I recommend just
biting the bullet and going with merged mining instead.

And, the point may be moot. Bitcoin miners may decide that, given their
expertise in seeking out cheap sources of power/cooling, they might as
well mine both/all chains. So your suggestion may not achieve your
desired result (and would, meanwhile, consume more of the economy's
resources -- some of these would not contribute even to a higher hashrate).

Paul
