It's important to note that bip 30 doesn't prevent duplication, it
just prevents the identified really evil outcome of the duplication.

There was discussion on doing the height _before_ that, but the
realization that the rewrites were a real vulnerability made it urgent
and rolling out the height will require time while the bip30 change
could be deployed more quickly.
