So,

The proposal is simple, and it's a small change for miners, I imagine.

My question is: why?

I worry about stuffing too many requirements on the coinbase. I suppose the
coinbase is easily extendible if we run out of bytes, but I think I'd like
to see some more discussion / good / bad type cases for making this change.
What do we get over just the prev_hash by doing this?

If this is just a voting mechanism for moving to v2 blocks, that's cool,
but it would be nice to codify voting in the coinbase a bit? Maybe? We've
now once voted with /p2sh/ and this is a different mechanism now, if I
understand it properly.

Anyway, some background would be great; if I missed it, I'm happy to go
read up, but I didn't see any links on the wiki.
