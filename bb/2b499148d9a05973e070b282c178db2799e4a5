Subject: [bitcoin-dev] The new obfuscation patch & GetStats
Message-ID: <56155572.5040501@domob.eu>

Hi!

I hope this is not a stupid question, but I thought I'd ask here first
instead of opening a Github ticket (in case I'm wrong).

With the recently merged "obfuscation" patch, content of the
"chainstate" LevelDB is obfuscated by XOR'ing against a random "key".
This is handled by CLevelDBWrapper's Read/Write methods, which probably
cover most of the usecases.

*However*, shouldn't it also be handled when iterating over the
database?  In particular, I would expect that the obfuscation key is
applied before line 119 in txdb.cpp (i. e., while iterating over the
coin database in CCoinsViewDB::GetStats).

Is there a reason why this need not be done there, or is this an actual
oversight?

Yours,
Daniel
