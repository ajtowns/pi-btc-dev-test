This will probably sound stupid to most of you, but I'll say it anyway.

The aim of mnemonics is to easily remember, isn't it?
But the approach of removing "offensive words" is probably
counterproductive to achieving that end. These words cause a greater
emotional impact in our human moral psyches.
If we were willing to use that fact in our advantage to optimize the
"maximum unforgettableness" criterion, we should actually prefer the
most generally offensive words in that list. Specially if they can
combine with each other to produce more offensive results, basically
the opposite of what we're doing.

Isn't "legalize murder dirty jew" much easier to remember for most
people than "sandwich house yellow cauliflower"?

I guess that even if I'm right, this will be hard to explain to users
and I'm not offering myself to do it. So I completely understand if
the people working on this BIP simply ignore this "unforgettable
wordlist" proposal like if it was just a bad taste joke.
Using the sub-optimal (in terms of human memory) politically correct
wordlist probably won't be that much worse.
