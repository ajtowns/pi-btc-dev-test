Since it's not very widely used outside of Austria and Germany, this may
be interesting for some: there is a second factor scheme called
"cardTAN" or "chipTAN" where authentication codes are generated on a
device which is not specifically linked to an accout. When
authenticating an online banking transaction the process is as follows:

1. Insert bank card into TAN generator
2. Scan flickering code on screen with the device's photodetector
3. Confirm amount to transfer and recipient on the generator
4. Finalize online banking transaction by entering a challenge-response
generated by the device
