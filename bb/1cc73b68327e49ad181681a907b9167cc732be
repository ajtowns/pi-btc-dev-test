And in doing so either reduce the claimable income from other transactions (miner won?t do that), or require paying more non-rebateable fee than is needed to get in the block (why would the user do that?)

This is specifically addressed in the text you quoted.

Discounted by the fact rebates would not be honored by other miners. The rebate would have to be higher than what they could get from straight fee collection, making it less profitable than doing nothing.

You?d still have to pay the minimum fee rate of the other transactions or you?d bring down the miners income. Otherwise this is nearly the same cost as the rebate fee, since they both involve explicit outputs claimed by the miner, but the rebate goes back to you. So why would you not want to do that instead?

A different way of looking at this proposal is that it creates a penalty for out of band payments.
