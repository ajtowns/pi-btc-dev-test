Keep in mind that Bitmessage uses the same ECDH mechanism as what
stealth addresses will use. They seem to get decent enough performance
from it for a use-case not-unlike that of a Bitcoin wallet.

In any case I'm interested in knowing actual performance numbers for it;
last I talked to Kyle Drake he said he was working on getting ECDH
numbers on Javascript, probably the slowest possible implementation of
the idea. As for send to stealth addresses using prefixes, he's
confirmed that you'll be able to do that will well under a second to
brute-force the prefixes with the proposed OP_RETURN mechanism even with
rather long 8-bit prefixes.
