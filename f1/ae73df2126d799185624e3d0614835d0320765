Well, "wally" is just a demo application, a command line client to
prove a technology.

The main development is in places like "node-libcoin", where a wallet
platform is being developed.  While maintaining a strong commitment to
the blockchain engine side of bitcoind, BitPay has enterprise wallet
needs that do not necessarily mesh well with the standard bitcoind
wallet.  Multi-sig, P2SH and other advanced features are key to the
future use of bitcoin in large enterprises.  Managers, CEOs and other
functionaries at a corporation may each have their own wallets /
keyrings, and cooperate to sign large value, high security bitcoin
multi-sig transactions, for example.
