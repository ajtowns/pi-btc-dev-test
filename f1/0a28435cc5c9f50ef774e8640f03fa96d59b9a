I think there are multiple reasons to raise the maximum block size, and
yes, fear of Bad Things Happening as we run up against the 1MB limit is one
of the reasons.

I take the opinion of smart engineers who actually do resource planning and
have seen what happens when networks run out of capacity very seriously.


And if so, if that is a reason for increase now, won't it be a reason for

Sure, it might be a reason for an increase later. Here's my message to
in-the-future Bitcoin engineers:  you should consider raising the maximum
block size if needed and you think the benefits of doing so (like increased
adoption or lower transaction fees or increased reliability) outweigh the
costs (like higher operating costs for full-nodes or the disruption caused
by ANY consensus rule change).
