I agree.

Steel-manning it, I guess I could argue that empty blocks are slightly
more conspicuous and might invite retaliation especially given the
high levels of mining centralization creates retaliation exposure. ...
but dummy transactions are hardly less conspicuous, many nodes log now
when blocks show up containing txn that they've never seen before.
Moreover, inexplicably underfilled blocks are produced (e.g. by
bitmain's antpool) and no retaliation seems to be forthcoming.
