None of these wallets (except Electrum maybe) could gain a significant
amount of new users during the last year or so, if you look at the stats
of Google Play.

Specifically Mycelium lost a significant amount of users during the last

consenquence, their developer announced on Reddit to try moving the
wallet to SPV.
