Thanks for bringing up the CCSS, Adam and Peter.

I was actually working on a post inviting everyone in this mailing list to come and participate?but you guys beat me to it. :)

The CCSS is an open standard, born out of the belief that sharing the industry's best practices amongst each other and with the community at large benefits everyone.
