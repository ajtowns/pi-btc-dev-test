Assuming that:
1. The current block size is 1MB
2. The block reward for a full block is 25.5BTC including tx fee
3. Miner is required to pay x% of reward penalty if he is trying to 
increase the size of the next block by x%

If a miner wants to increase the block size by 1 byte, the block size 
has to increase by 0.0001%, and the penalty will be 0.0000255BTC/byte. 
For a typical 230byte tx that'd be 0.005865BTC, or 1.35USD at current 
rate. This is the effective minimum tx fee.
