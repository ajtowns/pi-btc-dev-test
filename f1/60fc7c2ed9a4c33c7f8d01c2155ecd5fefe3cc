Ahh, data... a breath of fresh air...

Can you re-analyze for 8MB blocks?  There is no current proposal for 20MB
blocks.

Also, most hashing power is now using Matt Corallo's fast block propagation
network; slow 'block' propagation to merchants/end-users doesn't really
matter (as long as it doesn't get anywhere near the 10-minute block time).
