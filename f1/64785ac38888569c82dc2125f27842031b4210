Yes I am. There are some differences between BIP 39 and my proposal though. 

- BIP 39 offers an easy list of words, no gnarly string of case sensitive letters and numbers.
- BIP 39 only offers one fixed length of entropy, always 12 words, no option to increase or decrease the length.
- BIP 39 doesn't have a genesis date field, so no optimization during blockchain rescan.
- BIP 39 doesn't have password typo detection. No easy way to recover a password if you know most of it.
- BIP 39 does not have a user selectable KDF, only 2048 round PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512. 
- BIP 39 can't outsource the KDF computation to a 3rd party.
- BIP 39 wallet implementors can use their own word lists, breaking cross wallet compatibility.
