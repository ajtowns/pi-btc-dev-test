Very good points, and I think you're absolutely right.

But just running the numbers, to get the picture, based of scheiner's
statistics:

We're talking about a million terrahashes = 2^60 right?

With the block chain, you only have a 10 minute window, but with source
code you have a longer time to prepare.

Couldnt this be done with an ASIC in about a week?
