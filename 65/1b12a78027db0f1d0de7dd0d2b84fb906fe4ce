One more thought on putting arbitrary stuff in the scriptSig:

Miners could decide to revolt and remove the extra scriptSig
information before including the transaction in their blocks. They'd
still get the full transaction fee, and the transaction would still
validate so the block would be accepted by everybody else.

Come to think of it, if a node relaying transactions wanted to save
bandwidth costs or be annoying, it could also strip off the extra
information before forwarding it, so this isn't a reliable
communication mechanism. It is probably a much better idea to use
another protocol to gather signatures.
