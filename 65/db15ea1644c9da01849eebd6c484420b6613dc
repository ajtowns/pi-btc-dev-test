How do you know what traffic it's actually doing.

I'm confused as to how its doing anything at all, as it doesn't have
the exit flag. (IIRC, Tor directories won't give you the exit flag
unless you exit 80/443 to a pretty substantial chunk of IPv4 space).
Because of this no normal tor node should be selecting it as an exit.

Could this just be lying about its traffic levels?
