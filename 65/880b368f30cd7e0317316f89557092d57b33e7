Ken and team,

Took some time but here it is ! *Bravo !*

And as usual reporter make up the shit they want ... Feel free to remind
them that we had a working group and we worked on it.
https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15840008/new-emoji-
unicode-consortium-version-10-bitcoin-symbol

The "Could be" is a bit too much. It's time we keep reporter in check so
feel free to remind her in your own way.
My way is "pissed off tweet", https://twitter.com/TheoBitcoin/status/
877277497796198400 but used your own way.

A page is officially turned.

Regards,
Theo
