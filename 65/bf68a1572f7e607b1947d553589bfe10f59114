Haha, yes, I know that. But we had been trying to get a 2-of-3 to be accepted by something for hours, and everything was rejecting it: Coinb.in, our local Bitcoind, the Eligius tx push form. Evidently something did accept it and we didn't notice. We're starting over again now and trying to reproduce the success (or failure).
