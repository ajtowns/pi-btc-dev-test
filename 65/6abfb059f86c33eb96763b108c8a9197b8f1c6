Even if to someone who didn't care about anyone's privacy at all,
non-taproot is simply inefficient.  In the (I argue) overwhelmingly
common case of everyone-agrees simple hash based branching requires a
30% overhead to communicate the commitment to the untaken branch (and
worse in the case of extensive aggregation).  I don't think an
argument can be sustained in favor of that kind of communications
overhead.
