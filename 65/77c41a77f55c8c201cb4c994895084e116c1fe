My understanding of the question is this:

Are there any useful applications which would be impeded if a signing
party who could authorize an arbitrary transaction spending a coin had
the option to instead sign a delegation to a new script?

The reason this question is interesting to ask is because the obvious
answer is "no":  since the signer(s) could have signed an arbitrary
transaction instead, being able to delegate is strictly less powerful.
Moreover, absent graftroot they could always "delegate" non-atomically
by spending the coin with the output being the delegated script that
they would have graftrooted instead.

Sometimes obvious answers have non-obvious counter examples, e.g.
Andrews points related to blindsigning are worth keeping in mind.
