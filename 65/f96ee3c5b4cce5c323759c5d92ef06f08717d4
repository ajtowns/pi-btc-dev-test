I liked the cheekiness of your summary, Adam ;)

I'm not sure why this needs to be a BIP. It is a UX detail--not really
related to bitcoin protocol or procedures. I wouldn't even call it a
description of best practices, since every product's use case is going to
be different.

If you think there is a compelling reason for why this needs to be a
documented standard, please elaborate!

Thanks,
James
