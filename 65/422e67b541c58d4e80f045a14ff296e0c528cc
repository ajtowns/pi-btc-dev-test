Knowing the private key and owning the linked coins is not necessarily the same in front of a court.

At least in german law there is a difference between ?Eigentum' means ownership and ?Besitz? means ability to deal with it.
Being able to deal with an asset does not make you the owner.

There is no custodial relationship, as you have both the ability and the right to spend those bitcoins. Possession of a private key is equivalent to ownership of the bitcoins controlled by that private key.
