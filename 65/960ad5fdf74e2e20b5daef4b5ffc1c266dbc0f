A simple hack would be to crontab up a couple of dig scripts that every 
minute 'dig' (dig's output is in bind zonefile format) the bitcoin-seed 
and write the results to two zonefiles that bind can then serve.

Basically

dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5353 > zonefile1.zone
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5354 > zonefile2.zone

pkill -HUP named

Ugly, but should work.
