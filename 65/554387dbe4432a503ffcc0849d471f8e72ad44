It is very young in bitcoin's life.  We don't know what features will
work out best, or need to be radically changed after initial
deployment in the field.

Loose coordination is good.  Good ideas will spread on their own.
Users will demand compatibility with certain features, and fail to
care incompatibilities in other features.

Tight interoperability at this stage is too confining.
