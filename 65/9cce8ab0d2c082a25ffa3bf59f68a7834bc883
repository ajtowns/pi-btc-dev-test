I think that'd be too abstract. The purpose of the refund field is that so
if/when you receive a payment there, the wallet UI can do something
intelligent, like show you in your transactions list that a certain payment
was refunded using language the user will understand. If it's modelled at
the protocol level without that then it makes producing good UI's harder.
