Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Build: win64: Package 'mingw-w64-dev' has no
	installation candidate
Message-ID: <CAAMhxnxahG7nV2mBKx8pbV3qiVkJJGjvN-+Os81frBvp-GwHaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All
As part of trying to learn more about the bitcoin builds, I am trying to
recreate the travis CI build system using TeamCity.
Some of the builds work fine, but the windows builds seem to be having a
problem with getting mingw dev:

[08:31:21][Step 3/3] E: Package 'mingw-w64-dev' has no installation
candidate

I'm using the same exports env vars as the travis script, and actually
using the travis script inside teamcity , incuding adding the PPA for the
mingw packages.

The PPA seems to be importing fine during the build:
[Step 3/3] gpg: keyring `/tmp/tmp_nolyfrh/secring.gpg' created
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: keyring `/tmp/tmp_nolyfrh/pubring.gpg' created
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: requesting key F9CB8DB0 from hkp server
keyserver.ubuntu.com
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: /tmp/tmp_nolyfrh/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: key F9CB8DB0: public key "Launchpad PPA for
Ubuntu Wine Team" imported
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: Total number processed: 1
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1)

Any ideas why this seems to be working on travis and not on the teamcity
build agent?
The agent is running inside  docker image based on ubuntu.

The full log of the failed build can be found at :
http://btcdev.osherove.com:8111/viewLog.html?tab=buildLog&buildTypeId=Bitcoin_BuildWin64&buildId=332#_state=103&focus=242

same problem appears in win32 build.
there are the env vars:
