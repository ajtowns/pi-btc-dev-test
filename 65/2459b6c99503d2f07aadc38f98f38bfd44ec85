Bitcoin is valuable as a protocol because it is truly decentralized. The
complexity involved in building this system was expansive, but I think we
can all agree it was worth the trouble. With this particular topic of
instant transactions it seems we have to be very careful about pushing
Bitcoin in a centralized direction for the sake of a simple quick solution.
Building an automated system to solve the instant transaction problem will
be difficult, but also well worth the effort, and exactly like you're
saying Mike, I just want to make sure the door is left open protocol wise
for a robust solution in the future.
