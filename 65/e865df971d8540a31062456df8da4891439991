I know this list is not to advertise personal projects but
https://peersm.com/wallet might be of some interest, this is the web
interface for https://github.com/Ayms/bitcoin-transactions since
apparently quasi nobody succeeds to use it

As far as I know (and surprisingly) this is the only online tool that
converts bech32 addresses (Sipa's one does not output something
understandable by everybody, the tool is using his code), the only one
that converts from any address to any address, maybe the only one that
decodes simply redeem scripts and probably the only one that allows to
create transactions by its own (the advanced mode is not implemented for
now but will be soon)

Ideally it should be an offline tool if there is some incentive to do
so, so of course it is not advised to use his private keys for now

Maybe they are mistaken but some users are reporting invalid bech32
addresses from their Electrum wallet, after segwit, bech32 confusion
seems to be the topic of the moment

Regards

Aymeric
