Which is why I find the "SignedReceipt" somewhat superfluous. If you implement a payment system, like bit-pay/wallet you are likely to double that through some sort of e-mail receipt anyway.

Further, the inclusion of x509 is not really needed in the spec - you don't need to sign the invoice with an x509, you can use the payment key. The proof would still be equally binding, and valid also for non holders of x509 (server) certificates (like normal people).
Finally, host certificates does not normally keep in their "purpose" S/MIME Signing. So you are bending the intended use of the x509 certificate anyway.
