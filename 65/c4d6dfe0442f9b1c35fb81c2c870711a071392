There's no reason to require the full blockchain download before being up and 
running. Bitcoin-Qt 0.9 will (probably) have Pieter's work in this area to be 
usable very quickly, and download/verify the history in the background 
(there's no way to be completely trust-free without this).

Not sure what you mean here. Addresses and wallets are two completely 
different things. Addresses are single-use destinations that point to a wallet 
(which is itself private and unknown to the network).
