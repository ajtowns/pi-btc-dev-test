I'm one of the people experimenting in this area.  I've long argued
that a zero-output transaction should be permitted -- 100% miner fee
-- as an elegant proof of sacrifice.  Unfortunately that requires a
hard fork.  Also, for most people, it seems likely that a change
transaction would be generated.  That, then, would generate an
already-standard transaction, where inputs > outputs.
