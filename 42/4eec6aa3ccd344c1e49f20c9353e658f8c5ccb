FWIW the "coining" I am referring to is here:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7972.msg116285#msg116285

OK, with that, here goes. Firstly some terminology. I'm going to call these
things SPV clients for "simplified payment verification". Headers-only is
kind of a mouthful and "lightweight client" is too vague, as there are
several other designs that could be described as lightweight like RPC
frontend and Stefans WebCoin API approach

At that time nobody used the term "SPV wallet" to refer to what apps like
BreadWallet or libraries like bitcoinj do. Satoshi used the term "client
only mode", Jeff was calling them "headers only client" etc. So I said, I'm
going to call them SPV wallets after the section of the whitepaper that
most precisely describes their operation.
