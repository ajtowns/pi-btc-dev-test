It's not a reasonable path forward right now given the lack of testing done with 8MB+ blocks, among many other problems. A way to help make that appear more reasonable would be to setup a 8MB testnet as I suggested, with two years or so of 8MB blocks in history as well as a large UTXO set to test performance characteristics.

Of course, that'll be a 840GB download - if that's unreasonable you might want to ask why 8MB blocks are reasonable...
