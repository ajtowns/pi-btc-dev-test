seems a bit overkill for how simple the format is, and pulling in a
large dependency just for this is a bit silly. Although making it
protobuf-compatible is an interesting idea, but I fear would be more
work than is worth? I haven't looked closed enough at the protobuf
encoding to be sure.

as a data point, I was able to build a simple serializer[1] in about an
afternoon. I would much prefer to use this lib in say, clightning (my
original goal), without having to have the larger protobuf dependency.
