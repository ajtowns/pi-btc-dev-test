Thank you for your input Ignacio. Looking at your proposal, I see that
its main feature is that it makes one of the shares privileged in the
sense that it must always take part in the reconstruction of the master
secret, while the remaining shares follow the K-of-M scheme. This is an
interesting idea.

To answer your questions:

We intend standardize the encoding format, splitting of the pre-master
secret into shares and the derivation of the master secret from the
pre-master secret in a single document. However, note that only one of
the four proposed master secret derivation functions will be selected
for the final version.

Three of the four proposed master secret derivation functions are
symmetric, which means that they allow users to migrate any existing
master secret (including a BIP-0039 mnemonic) to the new scheme.

Thanks,
