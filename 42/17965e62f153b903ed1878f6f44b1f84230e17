Minor detail: OP_RETURN doesn't work like that. You'd need OP_DROP.

Inputs don't have addresses, and addresses should only ever be used once.
You might be able to fix this by increasing the value of the change, though.
It would require a new signature-check opcode at the very least.

I don't see a purpose to this proposal. Miners always mine as if it's their 
*only* chance to get the fee, because if they don't, another miner will. Ie, 
after 1 block, the fee effectively drops to 0 already.

The standard problem with these is that miners are incentivised to publish 
their own "out of band fee" address so they get all the fee directly.
