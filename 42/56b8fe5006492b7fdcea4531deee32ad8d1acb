When the peer adds both parent and child to the memory pool, it should
forward both of them.

CPFP inherently requires that nodes keep transactions that they have
rejected due to low fees.

If peers requested parents, then it would be possible to forward them
onwards.

If a node receives a high-fee transaction and doesn't have the parent, it
could request the parent.

Spam protection could be handled by banning nodes which send lots of
"children" and then never having the parent to the transaction.

The rule would be that forwarding a transaction means that you have all its
parents back to transactions contained in blocks.
