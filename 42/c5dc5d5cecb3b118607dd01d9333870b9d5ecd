For person-to-person transactions of course any fee at all is confusing because you intuitively expect that if you send 1 mBTC, then 1 mBTC will arrive the other end. I wonder if we'll end up in a world where buying things from shops involves paying fees, and (more occasional?) person-to-person transactions tend to be free and people just understand that the money isn't going to be spendable for a while.

Indeed.

Transparency on fees is going to be good from a marketing point of view
as well: fact is, Bitcoin transations have fees involved, and if we're
up-front and honest about those fees and what they are and why, we
demystify the system and give people the confidence to tell others about
the cost-advantages of Bitcoin, and at the same time, combat fud about
fees with accurate and honest information.
