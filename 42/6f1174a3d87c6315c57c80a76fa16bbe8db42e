Your point is well made.

If everyone published their easy blocks at the 20 minute mark,
divergence would be a problem (though with 6/7 blocks being normal, the
network would probably recover).  I was proposing to relay them as
normal, they're just not accepted until 20 minutes.

(Though with the suggested variant of accepting the most-compatible
rather than first-seen block, this isn't so critical).

I hadn't thought about it that way, but I assumed GHOST mitigate this
down to some lower limit.  Or?

Agreed, that would be foolish.  Note that in my proposal, block
timestamps wouldn't reflect the delay (removing incentive to push
timestamps forward, but making judging historical blockchain's validity
harder).

Nice idea.  Publishing WIP blocks like this could provide evidence, but
you'd have to incentivize miners to publish them.  Can you think of a
way to do that (which beats simply reducing the block time)?

Thanks for your time,
Rusty.
