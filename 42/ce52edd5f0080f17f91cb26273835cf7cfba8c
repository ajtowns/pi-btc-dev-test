I would also suggest that the 520 byte push limitation be removed for v1 scripts as well. MERKLEBRANCHVERIFY in particular could benefit from larger proof sizes. To do so safely would require reworking script internals to use indirect pointers and reference counting for items on stack, but this is worth doing generally, and introducing a per-input hashing limit equal to a small multiple of the witness size (or retaining the opcount limit).
