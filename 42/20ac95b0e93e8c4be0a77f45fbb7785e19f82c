As stated above by Wuille this seems to not be a concern for typical P2SH
uses, but my argument here is simply that in many cases, not all
stakeholders in a transaction will hold one of the private keys required to
sign. And such stakeholders would want a guarantee that the original script
is followed as promised.

I agree that such flags typically wouldn't have a meaningful effect for
funds from non-P2SH addresses, since the entire transaction / script could
be replaced by the very same keyholders.

I'm not concerned by the ability to move funds to an address with the new
rules that you'd otherwise graftroot in, only that you can provide a
transparent guarantee that you ALSO follow the original script as promised.
What happens *after* you have followed the original script is unrelated,
IMHO.
