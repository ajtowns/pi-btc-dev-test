It doesn't look too good. I've tried Chrome, the AOSP browser and
Firefox. All insist on handling the link with their download manager,
which would involve an additional click. In the case of Chrome and AOSP,
that download manager a separate component that is not updatable with
the browser (rather its tied to the OS version afaik).

If you click on the file in the download manager of Chrome and AOSP it
opens as expected. On Firefox, it just ignores the click.

I registered the correct mime type and also set the mime type of the
href just in case. In case you want to have a look at the href, its on
http://wallet.schildbach.de and links to Gavins generator.

I didn't try suffixes, but I'd assume it behaves similar.

Any ideas what else to try?
