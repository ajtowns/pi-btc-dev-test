No, devices on this video are not on the same network, and even if they
would - I cannot control what ??remote hosts my phone would connect to, so
transaction may anyway travel around the globe before coming to the POS
even if they would be on one LAN.
As for transaction times - I'd say it varies. ?From my extensive testing
most of transactions usually come through within 2-5 seconds, but roughly
one in ten transactions may take more time, sometimes much more time.

?Yes, ?I'm certain about that we need to switch to BIP70 asap. As I said
earlier - support among the wallets is the biggest problem here really.
Only Andreas' Wallet supports it right now AFAIK, and even in there it's
only as "LABS feature", so will be turned off for most of users.

Yes, I've seen this demonstration, I think it was on reddit about two
month?? ago. Looks interesting, but by that time most of my client software
was already done, so I couldn't really use this.

?NFC
?as ?
back channel
?definitely ?
will not work
?. Mike proposed something ?like a threshold to define minimal amount
available for spending without confirmation, but I don't see this thing
becoming widely used any time soon, and before that we will need to have
"confirm" button tap.

Yes, this is a problem, I think bluetooth is offline on many devices, and
keeping it on all the time will harm security (if not real security, then
at least perceived by users) and also harm battery life, which will be seen
as huge problem by the users.
?Would be great to be ?able to control BT state automatically from within
the wallet app with user permission given once on installation time, but
not sure if it's possible in Android.
