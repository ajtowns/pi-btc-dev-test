That's not what this is about.

BIP70 isn't just payment, it is about communication the terms of the sale.

Let's say you're visiting an international webshop. But they don't ship to
your country. Wouldn't you want to know that before your start filling the
cart? With this, your wallet / browser extension could tell you right away
that you can't shop there. No time wasted!

That's just one requirement of many where you would benefit from being told
right away if it is acceptable for both parties or not.
