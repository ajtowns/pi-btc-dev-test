Gavin,
They are not analogous.

Increasing performance and making other changes that will help allow
scaling can be done while at small scale or large scale.
Dealing with full blocks and the resultant feedback effects is something
that can only be done when blocks are full.  It's just too complicated a
problem to solve without seeing the effects first hand, and unlike the
block size/scaling concerns, its binary, you're either in the situation
where demands outgrows supply or you aren't.

Fee estimation is one example, I tried very hard to make fee estimation
work well when blocks started filling up but it was impossible to truly
test and in the small sample of full blocks we've gotten since the code
went live, many improvements made themselves obvious.  Expanding mempools
is another issue that doesn't exist at all if supply > demand.   Turns out
to also be a difficult problem to solve.

Nevertheless, I mostly agree that these arguments shouldn't be the reason
not to expand block size, I think they are more just an example of how
immature all of this technology is, and we should be concentrating on
improving it before we're trying to scale it to world acceptance levels.
The saddest thing about this whole debate is how fundamental improvements
to the science of cryptocurrencies (things like segregated witness and
confidential transactions) are just getting lost in the circus debate
around trying to cram a few more users into the existing system sooner
rather than later.
