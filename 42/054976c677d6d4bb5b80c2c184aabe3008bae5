Who would be performing a Sybil attack against themselves? We're talking about a LAN here. All the nodes would be under the control of the same entity. In that case, you actually want them all connecting solely to a central hub node on the LAN, and the hub node should connect to "diverse and unpredictable" other nodes on the Bitcoin network.
