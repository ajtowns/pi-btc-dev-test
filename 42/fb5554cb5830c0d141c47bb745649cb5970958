Oh, hmm, well then, what is the difference or usage
between these two repositories in regards to the project?

Which one are the formal releases tagged (tbz's cut) in?

Which one has the branches with the commits that will
make it into the next formal release? ie: tracking along
0.5.x, 0.6.x, HEAD/master (to be branched for 0.7.x).

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin
https://git.gitorious.org/bitcoin/bitcoind-stable

I seem to be seeing more tags in the former, and
more maintained branches in the latter?
