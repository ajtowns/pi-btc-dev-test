It is not a bug that you are unable to selectively choose these features
with higher version numbers. The version selection is in there at all
because there is a possibility that there exists already signed
transactions which would violate these new rules. We wouldn't want these
transactions to become unspendable. However moving forward there is no
reason to selectively pick and choose which of these new consensus rules
you want to apply your transaction.
