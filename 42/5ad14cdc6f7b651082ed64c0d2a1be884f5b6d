Hmm, on second thought you're probably right for the standard case where
it's really P2P. On the other hand it kinda limits us in the future if
seeds have high-bandwidth nodes they can just point clients too, but
maybe just assuming the DNS seed might need high bandwidth as well is
acceptable.

I dunno, given how badly behaved a lot of ISP dns servers are re:
caching, maybe we're better off keeping it simple.
