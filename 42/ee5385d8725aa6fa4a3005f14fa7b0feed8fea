In IETF documents there is a required security considerations section,
see http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp72

In many of our documents the whole thing is a security consideration
but for ones like these we should probably always document the
weaknesses as set out from the rest of the document.  See how BIP32
enumerates the one-private-key-breaks the chain.

On this point the getutxos document is doing well.  Perhaps breaking
some things out of the auth section into a security /
security-limitations section.  In particular, can this document
specifically call out that a local network attacker can MITM all the
peers.

(If Mike would prefer, I can send a diff with proposed changes)
