Not sure if the comparison to XML and HTML holds: the lack of closing
tags makes the meaning of individual tokens ambiguous, like I pointed
out before. The use of segments gives at most two levels of nesting,
so any relationship among tokens in the same segment has to rely on
their relative position, which could result in ambiguities, like
whether a tag refers to a single input or the transaction as a whole.

Cheers,
