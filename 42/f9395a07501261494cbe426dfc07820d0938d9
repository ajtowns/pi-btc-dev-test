Just keep in mind it will be a little awkward that 54.3 uBTC is the
smallest unit that can be transferred [easily] and the standard fees are
500 uBTC.    It's not a deal breaker, it's just something that needs to
be taken into consideration when it comes to user perception (which is
one of the reasons we would make such a change in the first place). 

"Holy crap these fees are huge!  I thought Bitcoin didn't have fees!"

perfectly with Satoshi's being the decimal units.  Something that costs
$10USD would be 25000uBTC.  This isn't a problem for a place like South
Korea, where 10USD is about 10,000 Won, so we aren't even off on a scale
of usable currencies in major economies.

feel like they are getting in on the ground floor still (I own 100,000
uBTC!), and reduce the perception the Bitcoins are not divisible (I have
heard several people worry that 21 million is not enough units).
