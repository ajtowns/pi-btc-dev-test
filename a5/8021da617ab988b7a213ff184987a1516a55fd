Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Some more lightning-related git repos
Message-ID: <CABaSBaxA-Vcz92Eq8ogpDDdKJZ6MX9W+grdyUthzN9hkxmdSHw@mail.gmail.com>

I saw these two repositories through the -wizards IRC channel earlier
today. I have not reviewed any of the source code for quality, security or
functionality, so I don't have word to offer regarding status of these.

https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd
https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lightning-onion

Also other git repositories with related work:
https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning
https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork
