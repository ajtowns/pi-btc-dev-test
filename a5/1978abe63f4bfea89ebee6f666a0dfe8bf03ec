Also users don't have infinite unspent txouts in their wallets - if they
need to make two payments in a row and run out their wallet software is
(currently) going to spend the change txout and either be forced to
broadcast both transactions anyway, or the second payment-protocol-using
recipient will do so on their behalf. (in the future they might also do
a replacement tx replacing the first with a single tx paying both to
save on fees, again with the same problem)

Anyway what you want is payment atomicity: the customer losing control
of the funds must be atomic with respect to the payment going through.
>From that point of view it's unfortunate that Payment message contains
refund_to, memo, etc. That information should have been provided to the
merchant prior to them providing the list of addresses to pay.
