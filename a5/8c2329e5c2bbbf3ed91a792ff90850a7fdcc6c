I think a compromise - that is similar to signing tags but would still
work with the github process, and leaves a trail after merge - would
be: if you submit a stack of commits, only sign the most recent one.

As each commit contains the cryptographic hash of the previous commit,
which in turns contains the hash of that before it up to the root
commit, signing every commit if you have multiple in a row is
redundant.

I'll update the document and put it in the repository.
