Yes.

I think this is something we can explore over the coming years. I
favor having people commonly pass transactions around outside the
broadcast network with the transactions and their dependencies being
broadcast only when there's a lack of trust between recipient and
sender. The block chain is an optional service after all.

Yes, though it's worth remembering that the original Bitcoin design
did have participants communicate directly. When I talked with Satoshi
in 2009 he saw the pay-to-IP-address mode imagined as the normal way
to make payments, with pay-to-address being used as a kind of backup
for when the recipient was offline.

In the end that's not how things evolved, but it the pendulum could
easily swing back the other way.
