If Bitcoin continues to grow we probably will be at some as-yet-unknown

Yes, but equally all estimates are imperfect, and you can trade-off risk
that your transaction will not go through initially for lower fees.

Estimates can be made sufficiently conservative that they are rarely
wrong - this is basically the strategy of the current system. Given that
demand for blockchain space isn't "saturated" it works reasonably well
for now. But without a good mechanism to recover from an initial bad
estimate you have to be more conservative than is efficient.

To a first approximation there's not much reason for miners to take
anything other than fee-per-KB into account when determining what
transactions to mine; you want to stuff your 1MB block full of high
paying transactions. That a child tx may make a parent more profitable
to mine complicates things - Gavin's current fee estimator also makes
too-low-estimates in that case - and not all algorithms to do so will
come to the same conclusion. (doing it perfectly is something like
O(n^2), and imperfectly is O(1) but doesn't handle multiple children
well)

There are some second-order effects, a block is less likely to be
orphaned if all transactions in it have propagated sufficiently, thus a
miner should penalize very recently broadcast transactions. In addition
because miners never orphan themselves large miners have a significant
advantage regarding orphan-inducing effects. However those effects all
tend to be miner specific, and/or only temporary.

FWIW the logic behind orphans is currently rather frightening: a
rational miner will, the moment they learn that a block exists via the
quickly propagating block header, start working to extend that block
with one that either doesn't contain any transactions, or only contains
transactions they can be reasonably sure another miner didn't mine.
(e.g. via exclusive tx mining contracts) This boosts their profit
because they aren't wasting their effort while the rest of the block
propagates, removes much of the incentive have any limit on block size,
and incentivizes miners to extend chains they haven't actually validated
yet. (relying on the other miners incentive not to produce an invalid
block)

With a size-limited blocks inclusion is more a matter of supply and
demand than policy.
