Thanks for the credit, although I think the security properties of what you're
proposing are very different - and much weaker - than what I proposed in
Zookeyv.

As you state in [2] "if miners never validate sidechains at all, whoever bids
the most for the chain (on a continuous basis), can spam a 3-month long stream
of invalid headers, and then withdraw all of the coins deposited to the
sidechain." and "Since the mining is blind, and the sidechain-withdrawal
security-level is SPV, miners who remain blind forever have no way of telling
who ?should? really get the funds."

Finally, you suggest that in this event, miners *do* have to upgrade to a full
node, an expensive and time-consuming operation (and one that may be impossible
for some miners if necessary data isn't available).

It's unclear to me what the incentive is for miners to do any of this. Could
you explain in more detail what that incentive is?
