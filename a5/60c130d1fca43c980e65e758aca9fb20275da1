I'm not sure postponed is the right word. It wasn't in v1, but many useful

I don't think I proposed this exactly? It's the other way around - a
merchant issues an extension cert to allow the PP to act on their behalf.

I'm not sure I understand. Your proposal also has two signatures. Indeed it
must because delegation of authority requires a signature, but old clients
won't understand it.
