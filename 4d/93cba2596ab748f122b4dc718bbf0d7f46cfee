Telling the merchant who my security provider is not that different from
a privacy point of view from using their wifi.  In both cases they would
see us connect to the provider.  The connection / payload would be
encrypted of course.

In the mean time, we can un-multisig some of the coins for daily use, up
to a defined velocity limit.  (credit to Mike Hearn's for this idea)

Let's bring it closer.  p2sh.info shows an exponential increase,
currently at 8%.  At this rate, the majority of the coins will be
multisig near the end of the year.
