To mitigate against this, two chaintips could be tracked.  The miner tip
and the client tip.

Miners would build on the miner tip.  When performing client services, like
wallets, they would use the client tip.

The client would act exactly the same as any node, the only change would be
that it gives miner work based on the mining tip.

If the two tips end up significantly forking, there would be a warning to
the miner and perhaps eventually refuse to give out new work.

That would happen when there was a miner level hard-fork.

To launch that attack, you need to produce fake blocks.  That is
expensive.

Stephen Cale's suggestion to wait more than one block before counting a
transaction as confirmed would also help mitigate.
