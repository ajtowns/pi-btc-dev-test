Signed by the key pair referenced in the private output.

I misread your example.  If it was Bob, then the troll couldn't
generate the correct spend proof because he didn't see the private
output C.  The troll could try to replay the spend proof in the
Alice's transaction as soon as he sees it in the mempool, but then the
spend proof would be signed by the wrong user.

Only the recipients of the private outputs can see the previous owners
of the coins they receive (including amounts).  What everybody else
sees, is just meaningless hashes that hide both the recipient of the
coin and the amount.
