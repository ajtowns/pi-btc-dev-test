Tell you what, eloquent guy...

Give me 15 minutes in a public open mic session with you and i'll
remove you from your high horse and close your voice in Bitcoin, for
good.

Guaranteed. You're too stupid for me to let you run loose with client
funds and this great innovation.

Anytime, anywhere. I'm ready to dismantle your intellectual bankruptcy
in front of the world.

I'll go for your psychological throat first.

Sincerely,
Venzen Khaosan.
