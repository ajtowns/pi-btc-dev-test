The integrity of Bitcoin is more important than you and your personal
preferences.


You don't have the right to decide which valid scripts in the
blockchain will be disregarded, and neither does anyone else.


If you don't like what's in the blockchain, you and everybody else can
work within the protocol to orphan the offending block.


But if you fail, then what's written in the blockchain is final and
the sole purpose of the network is to enforce it - deal with it.


PS: We don't even know who runs BitUndo. They seem to have lots of
money to spend on web design - I wonder where it came from?
