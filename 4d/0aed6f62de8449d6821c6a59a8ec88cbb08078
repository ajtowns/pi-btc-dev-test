The reference to bandwidth increases makes no sense, the bandwidth in most of 
the world is already far exceeding the 8Mb limit. Not everyone lives where you 
live :)

In Germany you buy a 150Mbit connection for a flatrate and a cheap monthly 
rate, for instance.  Not saying that Germany is where all the miners are, but 
since 150Mbit allows one to comfortably have 16 megabyte blocks, it is a good 
example of how far off Luke's calculations are from real-world.

I don't belief your argument to push forward holds.
