Apparently we will not get an understanding and we will probably be told
soon that this is going off topic, so short answer

Eh --> No, maybe you would like to quote Mozilla or the W3C too, all of
those organizations are financed by the big companies and are promoting
their interests (specs, DRM, etc), then would you really trust them?

A full node does not have to validate all tx and blocks, I am not aware
of any P2P system organized with peers and intermediate nodes (with no
incentive) that did survive (diaspora for example), and the most famous
one (who btw is handling much more traffic than what you describe) is
doing well because there is an intrinsic incentive for the users, see my
comment here
https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/final-report-next-generation-internet-consultation,
surprising to see that nobody raised those issues during the consultation

Paradoxally crypto currencies allow now to reward/sustain other systems,
then probably they should concentrate first on how to reward/sustain
themselves, different ideas have surfaced to reward the full nodes but
still seem very far to materialize

Coming back again to the subject, does anyone have any idea of who are
behind the existing full nodes and how to rank them according to their
participation to the network? Up to now there has been quasi no
discussion about what are the plans for the full nodes which tends to
suggest that this is obvious
