To be quite frank, I'm a little disappointed we've fallen back on arguing over numbers pulled out of a hat rather than discussing far more fundamental issues such as the dev process generally, consensus building, and our basic understanding of what Bitcoin really is, its strengths and weaknesses, where it shows most promise, and communicating a more unified vision to the industry and the public.
