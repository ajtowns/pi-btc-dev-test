I gather that actual code changes to bitcoin-core and naturally all the other 
clients are already done in another place. Which is likely the reason for your 
impression.

I agree with your stance that more discussion in public is always good.

Lets allow people that work on bitcoin java, or completely other bitcoin based 
stuff to have a simple way to filter out the topics they are interested in.
Mailinglist handling is pretty trivial in practically all email software, 
people can equally trivially subscribe to multiple lists as their interests 
go.

As a long time open source developer, my experience is that more lists has 
never really caused fragmentation in the way that you fear.
