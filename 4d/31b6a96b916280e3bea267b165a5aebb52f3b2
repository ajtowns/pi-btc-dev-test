Good Morning Dan,

No.

Let us suppose that IsStandard is applied to outputs, but we support P2SH. Then we could encode those scripts in P2SH. The softfork could require the script preimageto be put elsewhere, such as an OP_RETURN in the same tx, to determine the script that is anyone can spend.

We could ban P2SH or restrict P2SH to be IsStandard also, but you are now unable to support HTLC (no atomic swap) or LN, unless you specifically add those scripts to IsStandard. And if a better layer 2 comes along or LN is updated to use better scripts, you have to hardfork those in.

Even then, you can still be softforked. Remember that if we pay to a P2PKH, then publish the private key, every output paying to that address is now practically anyone can spend. Then a softfork can implement desired rules in an extensiom block, where money in UTXOs paying to the special publicized "private" key are controlled, post softfork, by data in a block that is not published to pre softfork nodes, like witness data is treated in SegWit.
