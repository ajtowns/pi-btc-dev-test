Planning for a hard forks which change the consensus rules (including
the blocksize limit) is something we can all agree is worthy of time and
effort.

However there is clearly not consensus sufficient today to deploy a hard
fork that changs the blocksize without there being serious and
potentially experiment ending consequences.

For a proposed hard fork to reach a level of consensus necessary to be
safe requires that there be a clear and self evident course of action.

That simply does not exist on the blocksize limit question.
