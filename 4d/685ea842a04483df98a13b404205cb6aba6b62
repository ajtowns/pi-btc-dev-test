I think I asked the wrong way, sorry: My question was not really meant at 
whether it is bug-free (testing that is the purpose of a release candidate, so 
we of course don't know yet), but rather whether it is at least feature 
complete now.

Remember, the previous v0.11.0 release notes said:

So I'm interested whether this limitation has been lifted, and the whole 
feature is considered as finished.

If yes, I would highly recommend advertising it in the new release notes - as 
said, the disk space reduction is a big deal.


Thank you!
