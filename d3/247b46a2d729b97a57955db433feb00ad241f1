No it's not. The cost is only incurred in the transactions actually get
mined, and unlike before the drop appears to be well under the
break-even orphan cost of transactions; we've got no reason to think the
clearance rate of these low-fee transactions will be significant.


But anyway, mostly I'm writing this to register my strong opposition
knowing full well that I don't expect it to change your minds.
