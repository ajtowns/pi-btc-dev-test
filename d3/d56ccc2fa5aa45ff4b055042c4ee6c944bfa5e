Thomas,

I like your idea about expanding Bitcoin URI's to include signatures. For
BIP75 store and forward servers we are already thinking the DNS record
would have the user's public key as well as the URL of their store and
forward endpoint, so as soon as that becomes a standard you could use it
just for the public key part. Expanding the Bitcoin URI should be done as
well, for people who want to go the simpler route and not rely on servers.

Erik, Andy, everyone else,

I don't understand why subscriptions would need to be built into the
protocol. With BIP75 the merchant could automatically issue a
PaymentRequest message every X amount of time, and the customer's wallet
would either display the request like normal or be set to pre-authorize
requests from the merchant. If the merchant goes out of business, the
requests would stop coming. This sounds like a UI issue and not a
protocol-level requirement.

If you think I'm wrong, please explain why :)
