Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Sudden temporary drop in reachable nodes?
Message-ID: <CANEZrP2HuZc_5E0o5T6DUOvmFr8qmYrhPC9S-VAhJWmA=CbtDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Addy,

I am seeing a big drop in reachable nodes on
http://getaddr.bitnodes.io/dashboard/ starting from about March 25th 7:20pm
and coming back 9:35pm. Is this a glitch in the monitoring system or did
some real network event happen then?
