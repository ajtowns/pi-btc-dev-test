Contrasts
-My protocol works, your's doesn't. It's not enough to have a mix, the
mix needs to be verifiable to avoid
one of the mixers inserting their own key and removing a key that
should be in there. That doesn't mean you can't make your protocol
work with some more magic, but magic is required.
-You need a lot of online computation: the recipients need to be
involved with validating the mix. By contrast in mine you need to wait for
enough people to get their bitcoins to avoid partitioning. But this
might be a strength,
not a weakness.
-You avoid the problem of de-anonymizing through having the protocol
run incompletely: if the permutation is correctly computed the
transaction goes through.
-You also avoid all the problems with modifications to the bitcoin
clients and miners.

It's definitely a good alternative, once you fix the problem in 1.

On a related note, private keys and signatures have better proofs of
knowledge then hashes. Has this been considered in the P2SH
conversation? There might be ways to use this to make even better
methods for enhancing anonymity.
Sincerely,
Watson Ladd
