Hi!

        CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY [...] allows payment channel
        setup to be risk free [...] something that was
        not the case before, when the refund Bitcoin transaction
        depended on another, unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction. Building
        on unconfirmed transactions is currently not safe in Bitcoin

With Segregated Witness, this is now safe.  With that expected soon, I'd
encourage you to take advantage of it.

Cheers,
Rusty.
