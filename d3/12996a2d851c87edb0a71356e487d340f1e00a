And this attitude is why bitcoin-core is going to get dropped and,
hopefully, instead of just one code to rule them all, we will have
good specifications and multiple competing implementations.

One of the significant adverse impacts of Segwit is the following:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L2861

When viewed on Github, less than one third of the consensus-critical
code is visible on-screen.

This is a maintenance and readability nightmare, in my opinion. There
are many good reasons why giving *users* the ability to firewall off
that code, maybe even with #ifdefs, as ugly as they are, would provide
some much better confidence that one is indeed, not running segwit.

I suspect it would help the community a great deal in comfort level
if this code were easier to read and used some type of coding standard
in which the default github view on the average browser shows all the
code without having a "hidden feature" that requires scrolling that
has no obvious UI indication you even need to scroll.
