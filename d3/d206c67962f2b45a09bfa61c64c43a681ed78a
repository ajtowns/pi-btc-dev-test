We'll see how it will go, maybe I will get to implement this somewhere soon.

Yes, I'm thinking exactly about radio MitM attacks possible with bluetooth.
I'll also look into using PKI inside the PoS for the merchant. It would be
great user experience if we would be able to provide a signed payment
request with human recognizable merchant identity name in the way you
described much earlier in Bitcoin 0.9 FAQ. ?
