All versions of Bitcoin Core since 0.13.1 signal segwit, 0.14.1+ even
when downstream mining software doesn't support it.

I think it would be useful for there to exist a useful and trivial
patch against current (0.14.2) software to engage in the BIP91-like
orphaning, like people have provided for BIP148-- but right now I
don't see any specification of the behavior so it's unclear to me
_exactly_ what it would need to implement to be consistent.
