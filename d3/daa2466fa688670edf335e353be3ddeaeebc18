We are aware of the distintion between hardness (expected work) and
likelihood of successful attack -- much of Appendix B talks about this,
in the context of producing compact SPV proofs which are (a) hard to
forge, and (b) very unlikely to be forgeries.

We did spend some time formalizing this but due to space constraints
(and it being somewhat beside the point of the whitepaper beyond "we
believe it is possible to do"), we did not explore this in as great
depth as we'd have liked.

Well, even in the absense of a reorganization, the attacker's false proof
will just be invalidated by a proof of longer work on the real chain.
And there is still a real cost to producing the false proof.
