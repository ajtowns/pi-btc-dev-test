Well that's the thing: the cost to find all stealth-address-using
payments to you isn't O(n) transaction volume, it's O(n) anonymity set
size. I think we can make a pretty good argument that the anonymity set
people need is mostly fixed in size and has nothing to do with overall
tx volume, so really we've got O(1) scaling.

There is a catch however: if you need the prefix to be against
H(scriptPubKey) rather than scriptPubKey directly the sender needs to
grind the OP_RETURN output at 2^len(prefix) cost. Fortunately that
grinding can be done with hash operations rather than ECC - even if we
needed 32-bit prefixes eventually computing 32-bit hash collisions is
plausible, and more reasonable 8-bit is quite doable now.
