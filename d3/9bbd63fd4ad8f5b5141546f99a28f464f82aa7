This is unrelated to Slush's question.

The complexity of IsConfirmed/Ismine is exponential and starts taking
tens of seconds at a chain of a dozen unconfirmed transactions (and
growing from there)

There are some patches that change this, but since the whole network
will only average about 7tx per second, you're probably doing
something wrong if you're building great big chains of unconfirmed
transaction.  Are you aware of sendmany?
