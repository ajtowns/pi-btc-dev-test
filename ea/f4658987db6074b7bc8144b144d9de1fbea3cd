This gives the same total difficulty but miners are throwing away otherwise
valid blocks.

This means that it is technically a soft fork.  All new blocks are valid
according to the old rule.

In practice, it is kind of a hard fork.  If Y is 10, then all upgraded
miners are throwing away 90% of the blocks that are valid under the old
rules.

This means that someone with 15% of the network power has a majority of the
effective hashing power, since 15% is greater than 8.5% (85% * 0.1).

The slow roll-out helps mitigate this though.  It gives non-upgraded
clients time to react.  If there is only a 5% difference initially, then
the attacker doesn't get much benefit.

The main differences are that there's a public key identifier the miners

I don't think public keys are strictly required.  Registering them with
DNSSEC is way over the top.  They can just publish the key on their website
and then use that for their identity.
