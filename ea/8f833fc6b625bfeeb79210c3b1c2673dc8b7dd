this is an excellent "painting the bikeshed" question, so i cannot
resist participation :)

imo, anyone who has any business looking at the beps (which would
generally be technically-minded people), will be smart enough to
google for "bitcoin bep003" to find what he's looking for. so i don't
see an issue, whatever acronym we end up using.
