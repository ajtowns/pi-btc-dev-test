I'm thinking about a use case I hope will become common next year -
pastebin style hosting sites for payment requests. Like, if I as a regular
end user wish to use the payment protocol, I could just upload a (possibly
signed) payment request to:

payr.com/a62gahZ

or whatever, and then payr.com can take care of incrementing the iteration
count on each download of my file. That's why it's useful for it to be
unsigned.

Absolutely. The two use cases can both be supported. You could give
iteration ranges, for instance, if you want to specify expiry in terms of
number of payments rather than time.
