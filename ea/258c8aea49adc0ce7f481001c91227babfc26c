There has been no transactions violating the requirement being added to the chain since at least August 2015. In addition, every non-compliant signature can trivially be converted into a compliant one, so there is no loss of functionality by this requirement.

This should say "for all scriptPubKey types in actual use, non-compliant
signatures can trivially be converted into compliant ones"

You can of course create a scriptPubKey where that's not possible, but
fortunately no-one appears to do that.


Also, as original author of NULLDUMMY, thanks for finally making it into a
soft-fork!
