Why does it matter what the "total work" of the network is? Anyone who is
participating as a node on the network only cares about the resources
required to run their own node, not the resources everyone else needs to
run their nodes.

Also, no assumption needed, it is quite clear that the number of nodes is
not scaling along with the number of users. If anything it appears to be
inversely proportional.
