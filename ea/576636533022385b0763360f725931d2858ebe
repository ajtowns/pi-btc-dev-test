Hi Mike,

It seems to me there is some confusion about this. Taylor's talking about a standard way to pass around data; the end user would never be exposed to something like a "vCard". That vCard's existence itself would in fact be very temporary.

I'm not totally convinced vCard support is the best idea relative to social network integration - I can't recall the last time I saw someone use a vCard. However, that should not hold you back from experimenting or prototyping. All an extension requires is some tag numbers and we're not in danger of running out of numbers any time soon.
