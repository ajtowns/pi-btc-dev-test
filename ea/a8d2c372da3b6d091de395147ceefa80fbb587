Hmm, the flags are identical in 0.13 and 0.14 clients.

Either way, this is rather trivial to solve. If bugs in older clients mean 
they can?t operate properly when SW is activated (via bit 4) but they don?t 
know its activated (since they only look at bit1), then just ban them when 
they misbehave.
And tell people to upgrade to a version where SegWit is less buggy.

Heh, well, this is rather simple to solve by not having all those activation 
codepaths and just picking **one**.

You can safely replace the bit1 activation code with a bit4 activation 
logic, which is based on 80% and has no end-date.
We both know that the bip9 (bit1) based activation will not trigger before 
the expiration date anyway.

These worries are rather trivial to solve if you do a little bit of proper 
architecture of the solution.  This honestly can?t be a reason for saying NO 
to the majority of the mining hash power giving you a break and offering a 
better SegWit activation.
