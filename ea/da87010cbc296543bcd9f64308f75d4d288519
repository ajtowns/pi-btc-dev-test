bitcoinj-0.10 release notes:

   - We now require Bloom-capable (0.8+) peers by default and will
   disconnect from older nodes. This avoids accidental bandwidth saturation on
   mobile devices.

Given the user-security concern that Peter brings up, reconsideration of
this new default behavior in SPV clients may be warranted.
