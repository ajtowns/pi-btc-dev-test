Sounds great.
Does it support merged mining?
Also, I'm a bit skeptic about it being chain agnostic. I want to
implement a chain with demurrage and I think I'll need to also change
coinWallet and not only create an implementation of the interface
Chain.
Anyway, this will make the task much easier. Thank you.
Until I have the time to code it, there's a little bounty (7.3 btc)
for this in case you're interested.
