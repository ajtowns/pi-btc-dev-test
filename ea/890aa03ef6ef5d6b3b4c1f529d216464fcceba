Indeed, pull requests don't have a "status".
It would be possible to (ab)use labels for this.

The drawback of labels is that only the repository team can set these,
there is no way to delegate. But I suppose it'd be possible to build
something on top of the github API that handles this.

Well - the only way to avoid that is to set a reasonable deadline,
after which there is a default decision. You'd hope this would
motivate people to get involved in time.
