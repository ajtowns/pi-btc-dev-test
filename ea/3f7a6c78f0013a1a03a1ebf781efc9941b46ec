Thanks, I hadn't seen this before!  That's also the first time I've seen
SIGHASH_NONE used.

Yes, I read this as proposed, it is clever.  Not sure we'd be
introducing it if OP_CODESEPARATOR didn't already exist, but at least
it's a simplfication.

But since the wallet is not aware of the actual content of the script, it has to guess the meaning of such committed positions, like ?with the HD key path m/x/y/z, I assume the script template is blah blah blah because I never use this path for another script template, and the meaning of signing the 3rd CODESEPARATOR is blah blah blah?. It still works if the assumptions hold, but sounds quite unreliable to me.

My question is more fundamental.  If NOINPUT doesn't commit to the input
at all, no script, no code separator, nothing.  I'm struggling to
understand your original comment was "without signing the script or
masked script, OP_CODESEPARATOR becomes unusable or insecure with
NOINPUT."

I mean, non-useful, sure.  Its purpose is to alter signature behavior,
and from the script POV there's no signature with this form of NOINPUT.
But other than the already-established "I reused keys for multiple
outputs" oops, I don't see any new dangers?

Thanks,
Rusty.
