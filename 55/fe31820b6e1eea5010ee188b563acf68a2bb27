So it seems to me that all I need to do is figure out who the current leader is,
and DDoS him off the network to shut Bitcoin-NG down.

This is a significant advantage to bitcoin's ex-post-facto blocks: no one knows
where the next one will come from.  The only way to shut the network down is to
shut all nodes down.
