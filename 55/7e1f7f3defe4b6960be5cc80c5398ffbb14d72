I've lately been updating the BIP text without updating the code in
the repository; I've synced them now. The sigsize=0 case was actually
already handled elsewhere already, so I removed the code and added a
comment about it now in the BIP text.

You didn't miss anything; that's correct. In fact, Peter Todd already
pointed out the possibility of making non-empty invalid signatures
illegal. The reason for not doing it yet is that I'd like this BIP to
be minimal and uncontroversial - it's a real problem we want to fix as
fast as is reasonable. It wouldn't be hard to make this a standardness
rule though, and perhaps later softfork it in as consensus rule if
there was sufficient agreement about it.

A significiant part of DERSIG behaviour (which didn't change, only the
cases in which it is enforced) was already tested, in fact. Some
branches remained untested however; I've added extra test cases in the
repository. They give 100% coverage for IsValidSignatureEncoding (the
new name for IsDERSignature) now (tested with gcov).

I agree, but that requires very significant changes to the codebase,
as we currently have no way to mine blocks with non-acceptable
transactions. Ideally, the RPC tests gain some means of
building/mining blocks from without the Python test framework. Things
like that would make the code changes also hard to backport, which we
definitely will need to do to roll this out quickly.

Fixed.

Thanks!
