Oh, and I don't want to give the wrong impression: there's no need to
rush to get this problem fixed. Even if someone wanted to launch an
attack right now, with a fair amount of resources, there's a lot of
counter-measures based on human intervention that can definitely stop
the attack in the short-term; what's needed is at worst moderate-term,
and much more likely a long-term approach. In addition, keep in mind
that this attack is very easy to detect, so if one is actually launched
we will know immediately and can start taking direct counter-measures at
that time.

That Gregory Maxwell so quickly identified a flaw in this proposed
solution suggests we should proceed carefully.

It'd be good to do a test of this attack, as well as possible solutions,
on testnet to better explore it and possible counter-measures.
