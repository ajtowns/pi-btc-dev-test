I think that's the concern: we don't - and *can't* - know. Pending patents are 
not publicly visible, as far as I am aware, and the BIP process does not 
(presently) require any patent disclosure.

Of course, it is entirely possible to voluntarily provide a disclosure of 
patents in the BIP (and ideally a free license to such patents, at least those 
for the BIP). This is an alternative possibility to resolve patent concerns if 
Rootstock is not prepared to adopt a defensive patent strategy in general 
(yet?).

I don't know if it's possible to implement decentralised sidechains without 
"breaking" this rule. But I would argue that in this scenario, the only way it 
would become invalid is the equivalent of a double-spend... and therefore it 
may be acceptable in relation to this argument.
