Ah, well that's simple. Because any decentralized system is going to have
high transaction costs and scarcity anyway. So far the only mechanism we
know for how to do this is something like bitcoin. As a centralized system,
bitcoin is already strongly outcompeted by many, many other designs, so
that shouldn't be very surprising I think.
