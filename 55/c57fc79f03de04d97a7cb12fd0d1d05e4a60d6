I think if we wanted to burn lost/stale coins a better approach would be
returning them to miner's as a fee - there will always be lost coins and
miners will be able to get that additional revenue stream as the mining
reward halves. I also don't think we need to worry about doing a gradual
value loss neither, we should just put a limit on UTXO age in block
count (actually I would round it up to 210k blocks as explained below...).


So lets say for example we decide to keep 5 210k blocks "generations"
(that's over 15 years), then on the first block of the 6th generation
all UTXO's from the 1st generation are invalidated and returned into a
"pool".

Given these (values in satoshis):

Pool "P" (invalided UTXO minus total value reclaimed since last halving)
Leftover blocks "B" (210,000 minus blocks mined since last halving)

Then every mined block can reclaim FLOOR(P/B) satoshi in addition to
miner's reward and tx fees.

If the last block of a generation does not get the remainder of the pool
(FLOOR(P/1) == P) it should get carried over.


This would ensure we can clear old blocks after a few generations and
that burnt/lost coins eventually get back in circulation. Also it would
reduce the reliance of miners on actual TX fees.


To avoid excessive miner reward initially, for the first few iterations
the value of B could be increased (I haven't calculated the UTXO size of
the first 210k blocks but it could be excessively high...) or the value
each block can reclaim could be caped (so we would reclaim at an
artificial capacity until the pool depletes...).
