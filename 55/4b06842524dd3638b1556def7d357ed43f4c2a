This is demonstrably impossible: anything that can be done with software
can be done with hardware. This is computer science 101.
And specialized hardware can always be more efficient, at least
energy-wise.

On the other hand, BIP99 explicitly contemplates "anti-miner hardforks"
(obviously not for so called "ASIC-resistance" [an absurd term coined to
promote some altcoins], but just for restarting the ASIC and mining market
in case mining becomes too centralized).
