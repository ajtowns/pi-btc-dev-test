IIRC you were previously informed by moderators (on the same reddit thread
to which you refer) that it would seem you had canceled your email from the
moderation queue, contrary to your retelling above. This is now reaching

bitcoin-discuss at lists.linuxfoundation.org or
bitcoin-dev-owners at lists.linuxfoundation.org instead of the bitcoin-dev
mailing list.
