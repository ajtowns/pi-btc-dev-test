Yes, you're right. I didn't consider that case. But the problem is that
this is not automatic. Currently there is a clear division between
miners how will not take the kickback (irrrational) and miners who will
(rational).
If somebody modifies the bitcoind to make this choice automatic, then
DECOR+ is the only solution I know about to avoid people doing anonymous
double-spends (with chained kickbacks, as you mention).
The  "locktime on normal transactions" you proposed does not solve the
problem, just diminishes it in a constant value (which currently is very
low)
