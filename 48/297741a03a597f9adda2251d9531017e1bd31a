Are we going to move ahead with this?

If so, I'm volunteering to create the repository and import the current
BIPs from the wiki there (and convert from wiki markup to markdown where
necessary).

Personally I think it is useful to have a number as soon as a BIP can be
implemented, even if still in draft status; it gives something to refer to
when mentioning a certain improvement proposal (in commit messages and such
it could be called BIP xxx Draft).
I don't think we are at risk of running out of numbers to assign any time
soon.
