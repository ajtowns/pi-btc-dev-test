What of this prior effort, proposing B-with-horizontal-bar (?)?
http://bitcoinsymbol.org/

They argue that B-with-2-vertical-bars is easily confused with the Thai
Bhat currency symbol, which is a B with a single vertical bar.

I'm not terribly fond of the B-with-horizontal-bar as a symbol, but it does
have the advantage that it is already in the Unicode glyph set, already
available on most Unicode enabled devices.
