<TD> petertodd: yeah somebody put a file upload tool into the chain
and then tried to upload the entire amibios source code to it. stupid.
<TD> someone thinks it's a lot more important than it really is
<petertodd> TD: and 2.5MB of wikileaks data, and a whole bunch of GPG
encrypted stuff, and the hidden wiki cp/jb sections (no idea if it's
all the same person)
<petertodd> jgarzik:

iirc this is gpg symmetric key encrypted
<petertodd> jgarzik: (I wrote a tool to download the tool to download data)
<petertodd> MC1984_: just checked, surprisingly no-one has put
