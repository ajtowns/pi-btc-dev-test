This is currently not feasible due to BerkelyDB limitations. All the
databases are within one 'environment', which is necessarily one directory
(it can probably be hacked around, but obviously we're really careful).

When LevelDB for the block chain and the custom format for the wallets is
introduces, various new configurations will be possible: Multiple wallets,
wallet in block chain in separate dirs, etc.
