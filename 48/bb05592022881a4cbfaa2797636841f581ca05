I am indifferent on this issue (the bit inversion), but so far only Jorge
has spoken up. I opted for this detail during implementation in order to
preserve existing semantics, even if those semantics are not commonly used.
This was the conservative choice, driven in part because I didn't want the
proposal to be held up by the other side saying "this is confusing because
it changes how sequence numbers work! it used to count up but now it counts
down!"

I can see both sides and as I said I'm indifferent, so I went with the
conservative choice of not messing with existing semantics. However if
there is strong preferences from _multiple_ people on this matter it is not
too late to change. If anyone feels strongly about this, please speak up.
