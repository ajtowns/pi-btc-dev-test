I want to avoid the case where a transaction confirms, but the
associated payment is not delivered. If there is a reasonable chance
that this case occurs in normal operation, it means the payment
transmission cannot be relied upon.

On the other hand, if the payment gets sent, but the transaction is
not broadcasted, it can be broadcasted by the receiver (who has much
more reason to do so; he wants to spend his money).

So, yes, sending on the P2P network is fine, as long as everything is
done to get the payment delivered. Not broadcasting on P2P is just an
optimization that makes failures of not getting the transaction out
and not getting the payment delivered coincide better. I say just
optimization, as you can't rely on the fact that if the payment fails,
the transaction will also fail (the merchant may be malicious, make
the submission of the payment fail, but broadcast the transaction
anyway), so wallets must still be able to deal with this. Nonetheless,
I think it can increase the reliability of "payment being received for
otherwise confirming transactions".

That's a different issue. I'm very aware that payments over HTTP can
fail. The point is that I prefer the entire transaction to fail in
that case, instead, and focus on making the payment submission more
reliable.

I'm aware. What issues do you see?
