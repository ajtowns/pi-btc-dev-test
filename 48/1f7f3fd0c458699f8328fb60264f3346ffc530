Miner voting, while imperfect, is the least-worst of various solutions
which inject market input into the system.  It is is known quantity, field
tested, and must be sustained, in public, over a time span of months.  As
this thread shows, stakeholder and direct user voting is nigh impossible to
get right.

Choosing block size is fundamentally a central bank directive shaping the
fee market.  Whatever actor or algorithm or natural equilibrium picks the
block size, that choice will dictate the level of competition for fees, the
level of scarcity of an economically scarce resource.  Picking the block
size advantages some businesses over others, some business models over
others.  Software (and software devs) should not be the ones picking that
limit.

Checks-and-balances are also important.  BIP 100 notably includes two steps
at which user input is visibly and actively injected:   1) hard fork to
enable, and 2) a second hard fork if the system is to scale beyond 32MB.
The network users (not miners) twice approve the system.  Further, one must
remember all the basic miner incentives that do align with users, notably
that of maintaining the value of bitcoin tokens as their primary income
stream.
