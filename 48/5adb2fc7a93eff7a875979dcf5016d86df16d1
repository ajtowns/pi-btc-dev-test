Subject: Re: Freimarkets and investment

If assets were tagged you could do a very limited form of pre-signed offers:

in: 10 btc SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY
out: 1 AAA

These are composable, in that you can append the inputs and outputs of
multiple offers together and result in a valid transaction. However this
is pretty much the limit of what is possible without adding new SIGHASH
modes, and if you're going to hard-fork to add tagging, then you might
as well go the whole distance with explicit hierarchical
sub-transactions as we did with Freimarkets.

Cheers,
Mark
