If I understood correctly, OP was not talking about the process inside a
node being single threaded, but instead that the whole bitcoin distributed
system behaves as single threaded computation. OP seems to be describing a
system closer to what IOTA uses, by distributing among the miners the task
of validating the transactions. Although, without more specific details, it
is hard to judge the benefits.
