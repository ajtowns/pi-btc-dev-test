If something means "giving up on the Bitcoin experiment", then for
sure it's not one mining policy or another, but the assumption
that we should have one uniform mining policy. If we had a community
where enough miners had their own opinion about the best mining
policy, and expressed it by choosing an appropriate mining pool, then
we would have better decentralized mining based on selfish motives of
the miners, rather than based on an abstract thought of
"centralization is bad, so I will consider how much mining profit
from qualitatively interchangable mining pools I'm willing to
sacrifice in order to ease my centralization fears".

Best regards,
