Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Deanonymisation of clients in Bitcoin P2P
 network paper
Message-ID: <CABssiCpUE=3GhC+Scd3htzVb9+gmLeZ0mEO5LY-zxywvguZ--w@mail.gmail.com>

That's what I was trying to say... The researchers are deanonymizing
transactions from non-Tor connected hosts. So why are we talking about Tor
limitations in response to this? Shouldn't we be discussing how to address
the issues in Bitcoin proper?

I might be mistaken, but it seems to me this paper discusses unintended ways

core Bitcoin network.

You're mistaken. :)

If a node is used exclusively via tor it effectively doesn't have a IP address.

(short of bugs of a class that aren't discussed here)

The paper is about fingerprinting approaches that probabilistically
connect transactions to hosts that you can already identify their IPs.
