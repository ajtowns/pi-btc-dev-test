As it's unlikely to be an automated system anyway, I do not see why
people claiming the bounties would need to agree with the GitHub TOS.
Besides which, I suspect most people contributing to bitcoin already
have agreed to it.

Although, if GitHub can't support the feature, it could be an argument
for setting up a bug tracker unrelated to GitHub.
