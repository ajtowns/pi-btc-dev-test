I think that would work.

In case of Bitcoin Wallet, the depth is not null (m/0'/[0,1]) and still
we need this field. I think it should always be present if a chain is
limited to a certain script type.

There is however the case where even on one chain, script types are
mixed. In this case the field should be omitted and the wallet needs to
scan for all (known) types. Afaik Bitcoin Core is taking this path.
