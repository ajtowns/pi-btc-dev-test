Sorry for keeping this short but I'm in holiday and reading/writing on my
phone is a pain.

It's a great way for companies to secure their assets.

Since. we have the possibility o add other signature schemes to the protocol
we could add an rsa-like scheme which allows m-out-of-n signatures. It works
by distributing shares of the key which are points on a curve having the
actual key as 0-value. It does not require special length for the key so if
ecdsa allows something similar there need not be anything changed.

Would be a first step.

Just wanted to point you in that alternative direction as it would possibly
keep backward compatibility and allow multisignature.
