I don't think you answered my question.

Again, we _already have_ the equivalent of BIP151 functionality in Bitcoin
Core, shipping in production, but implemented with a Tor dependency.

BIP151 removes that dependency on Tor, enabling encrypted connections
regardless of whether or not you have Tor installed.

So any arguments against BIP151 being implemented, are equally arguments
against our existing Tor onion support. Are you against that support? Because
if you aren't, you can't have any objections to BIP151 being implemented
either.
