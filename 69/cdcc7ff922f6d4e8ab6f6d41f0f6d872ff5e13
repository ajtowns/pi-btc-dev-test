I?m thinking along the same lines, a industry wide roadmap makes very little 
sense.

Much like in Linux we have a lot of smaller groups doing their own thing, 
all working for the good of Linux as they see it, and implicitly, as they 
use it.
I think its safe to say that Linus would not want any say over the roadmap 
of Intel or Google or any other particpant in the Linux space.

I am in agreement with Gregory that we should reject a Bitcoin-wide scaling 
roadmap.

I do suggest that smalle groups publish their individual roadmaps, show what 
they are planning to work on in a place that people will find it (a website, 
not a mailinglist archive).

Those individual roadmaps then show what that group will work on, which 
helps their communication. It helps people talking about Bitcoin to the 
general public as well, and it helps people understand whom they would like 
to support financially or otherwise.
