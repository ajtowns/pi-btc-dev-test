It's also the first/next step towards decentralising the DNS seeds (for SPV
clients), as it'd allow each node to explore the network and return better
quality results in getaddr.

This is sort of what Tor is going through with their guard nodes and how
often to rotate them.

I think the attack Ivan is talking about does not require sybil attacks to
work though, just listening to lots of peers. Raising the bar to require
the attacker to receive lots of connections seems like a win.
