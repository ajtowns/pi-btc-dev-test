Let's suppose I have an alternate blockchain that specifically encourages
address *RE* use, and charges those that desire privacy higher transaction
fees to cover the network cost in computation and storage.

Does the static address privacy system still work, or does it fall apart
because 95% of the transactions re-use addresses, making them 'effectively 
static', just like my DHCP IP that has not changed as long as I've used it?
