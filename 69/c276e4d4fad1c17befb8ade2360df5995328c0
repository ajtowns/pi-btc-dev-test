Let's not confuse bootstrapping with overall peer discovery.

Peer exchange between P2P nodes is the primary and best method of
obtaining free peers.

Obviously you need to bootstrap into that, though.  DNS seed and fixed
list are those bootstrap methods (IRC code was deleted), but are only
used to limp along until you can contact a real P2P node, at which
point peer discovery truly begins.
