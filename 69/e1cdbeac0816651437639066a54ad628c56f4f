I think you may be misunderstanding what BIPs are. They do not force nodes to 
take on any given relay/mining policy (thus, BIPs should never talk about 
IsStandard at all). They define standard for interoperability between 
software. So, if you want nodes to relay these transactions, you need to 
convince them, not merely write a BIP for the transaction format. Defining a 
BIP for cross-chain trading would be one way to do that.

The malleability "issue" has been known for years.
I wouldn't expect any special effort made to fix it...

There is some ongoing discussion of a softfork to basically redo the Script 
language entirely, but it will take quite a bit of time and development before 
we'll see it in the wild.

P.S. Did the BIP editor assign these numbers? If not, best to keep them 
numberless until assigned, to avoid confusion when people Google the real BIP 
44 and 45...
