For those interested in the hash collision attack discussion, it turns out there is a faster way to scan your set to find the collision:  you?d keep a sorted list of the hashes for each TX you generate and then use binary search to check that list for a collision for each new TX you randomly generate. Performing these operations can probably be reduced to N lg N complexity, which is doable for N ~2^32.   In other words, I now agree that the attack is feasible.  

Cheers,
Peter

So I am following you up to this point.  Indeed, there is a good chance that a pair of transactions from a set of 2^32 will have a collision in the first 64 bits.
