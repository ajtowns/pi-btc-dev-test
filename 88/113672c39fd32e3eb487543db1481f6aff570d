Would be fine for me, depends on the community, and it is one of those chunks that make many stall...

The reason for building on bitcoin/bitcoin directly is that this created a history of all changes, and this way I had a working version running each day while doing the refactoring - with my wallet at stake!

However, I think perhaps the bitcoin project should be split into a library, with a prototype client and the actual clients. This library facilitates this.

Cheers,

M

See the ponzicoin example for how you define your own chain.
