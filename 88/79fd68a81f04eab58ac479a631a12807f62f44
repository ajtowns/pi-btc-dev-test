Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Recent editing for the consensus BIPs of segregated
	witness (141 and 143)
Message-ID: <000001d19d3e$785f26d0$691d7470$@xbt.hk>

In the past month, there are a number of revisions in BIP141 and 143. Except
the use of BIP9 for deployment, none of these edits was a result of a change
of consensus behavior of the reference implementation. Instead, the text
were edited for clarifications or corrections to match the reference
implementation. The consensus specification (except the use of BIP9) has not
changed since early Feb 2016, if not earlier.
