Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Electrum Server Speed Test

I have concerns about the performance of the Electrum server software as
well.  It seems to load data one block at a time (which normally makes
sense) and I think it is even single threaded on transactions inside the
block.

To try to addresses these issues, I made my own implementation of the
electrum server.  It doesn't support UTXO (yet) but happily interacts with
all the clients I've tested.  It is heavily multithreaded, uses mongodb as
a key value store and bitcoinj for block and transaction parsing.

You can hit a running instance at:
b.1209k.com:50002:s
or
b.1209k.com:50001:t

A synced node uses 347G of mongodb storage.

Here are the recent blocks imported, with number of transactions and import
time.

These times are based on having mongodb on SSD.
The CPU is 8 core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5430  @ 2.66GHz

I'd be happy to help with anything you need to evaluate it.
