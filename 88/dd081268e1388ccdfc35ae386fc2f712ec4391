I think, you just proved my point. If your goal is to shrink the attack surface as much as possible,
you are better off being a marginalized alt-coin.


>This threat represents the difference between Bitcoin and Fedcoin.

_This_ is the false dichotomy. There's a range of coins between DarkCoin and FedCoin.


>This is extremely naive. At a minimum, getting popular/successful (and regulated) is the formula for regulatory capture.

Let me give you an example.

Suppose you are a regular guy, say Peter Todd, and you are faced with 10 policemen in anti-riot gear.

You can fight them in two ways:

1. become stronger, so you could provide an adequate response, either by turning into Hulk or by getting another 30-50 Peter Todds.

2. lose some fat, learn a few parkour tricks and move around mostly by night behind dumpsters.

The worst you can fare is just being Peter Todd with a backpack and an expensive camera on his neck, wandering around the city in daylight.


Your vision of Bitcoin is the most vulnerable to government attacks.
