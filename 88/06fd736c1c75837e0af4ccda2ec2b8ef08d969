Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Linux packaging letter
Message-ID: <CANEZrP2GvgZP_1z3EoSs3p+db7tZB6JfEVAewLpGE5eRpGgR3w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Some of us have put together an open letter to the Linux packaging
community, outlining why Bitcoin is different to other programs and asking
them to not patch or modify the upstream sources.

Please consider signing it if you agree (I think the wording by now is
fine, so don't edit the contents - use the comment feature if you want to
though).

The trigger for this is the discovery that Debian bitcoind's got split out
of the consensus some time in April, for reasons that nobody yet figured
out but is presumably related to a patch (eg it uses system leveldb).
