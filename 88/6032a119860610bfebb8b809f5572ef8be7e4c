Thanks for the comments and feedback.
I have previously read those threads as suggested by some members.
In relation with transactions, I do agree with suggestions that they should
be left on their own, and assumed that people would work in the  best
interest of themselves and society. Everything is debatable, but let's
agree with it.
But for miners, I can think of no other option to stop those who are
hashing and winning blocks+transaction fees and not in safe country
list(directly or indirectly).
Some have asked for proofs, but that is tough to substantiate. I have
hints, honestly.

Would you sit idle if Haqqani network is funded by bitcoin mining?

We have created a billion dollar market by bitcoin and ,sadly, for everyone
without borders. Sick, I am saying this, but freedom is more of
responsibility than celebrations of open hugs. And those who don't care
about it are threat for you and us, equally.

Folks, suggest something, scrap my idea, but let's build something to save
this ecosystem, otherwise it is impossible to realise this dream of
decentralized currency. Other coins and protocols are there who may
implement something, and egoists always meet the ashes.

Criticize with open mind.

Best,
Prabhat Kumar Singh
