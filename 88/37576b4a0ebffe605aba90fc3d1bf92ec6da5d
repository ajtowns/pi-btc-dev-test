Anyway the stuff Mike is saying about being able to detect upgrades is
incorrect - detecting an upgrade is *easier* with a soft-fork, just look
at the block header nVersion numbers and warn the user if they increase
beyond what you know is valid. Bitcoin Core implements this IIRC, and
bitcoinj should.

Someone with more time should write all this up for the bitcoin.org
developer docs BTW... There's extensive discussions on #bitcoin-dev and
others about all of this.
