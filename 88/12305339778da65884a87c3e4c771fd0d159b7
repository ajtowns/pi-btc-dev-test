Yes, that is much better.  The mention of "only one is insufficient" and
"two are sufficient" in the bullets clarifies them well too.

BIP acceptance hinges on accessibility and discussion.  Wherever discussion
happens, someone can mention the Wiki page they created to sidestep such an
unfortunate abuse.  I have always been in favor of allowing people to do
stupid things simply because that helps them learn not to do them.  The
result is often some (at least slight) embarrassment of the bad actor and a
lesson for everyone paying attention.  The censorship of BitcoinXT
discussion had this effect and has softened the enthusiasm many had for...
let's call it: guarding against their own cognitive dissonance through
censorship and intimidation.

In fact this last item is probably what raised a flag for me when thinking
about the specification that they should "link to a Bitcoin Wiki page with
a summary tone of the comments." I have too often seen great discussions of
controversy lose a lot of valuable input because they lived in an
environment controlled by someone who let bias infect their moderation
decisions.  I know that even I might do that, so encouraging others to have
access to my competitors feels right.
