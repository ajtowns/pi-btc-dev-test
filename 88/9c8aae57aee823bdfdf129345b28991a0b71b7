I agree the date can be brought forward. FWIW, I originally set the date far out enough that people wouldn't immediately fixate on the date and rather look at the meat of the proposal instead.

Given that we saw around 70% of nodes upgrade to BIP141 in around 5/6 months, I dont see any reason why we cant reduce the date to being 6 months or less from Nov. Given people are starving for segwit to the point of running BIP148, there is good evidence the community will upgrade in record time to BIP149.

Based on how fast we saw segwit adoption, why is the BIP149 timeout so
far in the future?

It seems to me that it could be six months after release and hit the
kind of density required to make a stable transition.

(If it were a different proposal and not segwit where we already have
seen what network penetration looks like-- that would be another
matter.)
