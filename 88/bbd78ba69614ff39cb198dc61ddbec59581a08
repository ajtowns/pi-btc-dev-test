Okay.

Generalization of the store interface may be more challenging than you
anticipate, but the objective makes sense.

We would not offer libbitcoinconsensus integration if it required us to
incorporate the store. These are distinct logical components, as are p2p
networking and client-server networking (e.g. RPC), for example. I would
not think of these as multiple versions of libbitcoinconsensus but
instead as distinct components of a bitcoin node. It doesn't make sense
to me that you would ship this as two consensus variants. I would work
toward shipping independent component libraries (i.e. consensus and store).
