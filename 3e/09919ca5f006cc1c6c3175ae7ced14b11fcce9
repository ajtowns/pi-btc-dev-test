While there is a lot that I would like to comment on, for the moment I will just mention that you should consider using the 17 bit relative time format used in CSV as an offset from the birthdate of the address, a field all addresses should also have.

This would also mean that addresses cannot last more than a year without user override, which might actually be a plus, but you could also extend the field by a few bits too if that was deemed not acceptable. An address should not be considered valid longer than anticipated lifetime of the underlying cryptosystem in any case, so every address should have an expiry.
