No, because of the way the weight is calculated, it is impossible to
create a block that old nodes would perceive as bigger than 1 mb
without also violating the weight limit.
After segwit activation, nodes supporting segwit don't need to
validate the 1 mb size limit anymore as long as they validate the
weight limit.

Huh, that's odd. It really does still count raw blockchain data blocksize.

It just uses a ratio between how many units each byte is worth for block
data vs signature data, plus a cap to define the maximum. So the current
max is 4 MB, with 1 MB of non-witness blockchain data being weighted to 4x
= 4 MB. That just means you replaced the two limits with one limit and a
ratio.

A hardfork increasing the size would likely have the ratio modified too.
With exactly the same effect as if it was two limits...

Either way, there's still going to be non-segwit nodes for ages.
