I can't speak for Peter, but *I* am currently of the opinion that non-merged
mined altchains using memory-hard proof-of-work are a far better option than
sha-256 merged-mined altchains. This is not a popular position on this list,
and I would like to respectfully disagree, but still collaborate on all the
other things where bitcoin-core *is* the best-in-class code available.

A truly 'distributed' system must support multiple alchains, and multiple 
proof-of-work hash algorithms, and probably support proof-of-stake as well.

If sha-256 is the only game in town the only advantage over the federal
reserve is I can at least audit the code that controls the money supply,
but it's not in any way distributed if the hash power is concentrated
among 5-10 major pools and 5-10 sha-256 asic vendors.

I find it very irresponsible for Bitcoiners to on one hand extol the virtues
of distributed systems and then in the same message claim any discussion
about alternate chains as 'off-topic'.

If bitcoin-core is for *distributed systems*, then all the different altcoins
with different hash algorithms should be viable topics for discussion.
