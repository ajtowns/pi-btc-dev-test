This is a simple post.

Who's got visualizations of votes?

One I've seen that I liked was

http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/

This just covered how developers feel about the various BIPs though.

A visualization I would like to see would include:

pie graph(s) of what % are voting for (BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, BIP sipa
etc) based on what's published in blocks.

Has anyone hacked up such a thing which would describe miner voting,
etc. visually in real time?
