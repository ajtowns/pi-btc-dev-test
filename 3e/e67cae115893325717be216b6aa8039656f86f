If we do decide to make Pops invalid as transactions, there are a lot
of ways to do that. I guess the main question is if we should make
Pops invalid as transactions or not. So far I prefer to keep them
valid for the above reason.

I would feel comfortable doing it. It's just a matter of trusting your
wallet, which you already do with your ordinary transactions.

No, I meant that it's ok to call it Proof of Payment even though
people may use it for other stuff.
