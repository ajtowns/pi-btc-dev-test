Script evaluation performance was what I was primarily concerned with.  I'm
fooling around with adding some new instruction types.
The tricky part is that to test how that effects performance, you need to
be able to intersperse transactions with the new instructions with existing
ones.  For accuracy, you'd like your simulated traffic to at least
approximate the real world traffic.


Also, is there any bench-marking / instrumentation in bitcoind ?
