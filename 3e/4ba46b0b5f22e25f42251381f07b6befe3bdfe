Subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.8.4 release candidate 2 : please help test
Message-ID: <CABsx9T0xz+fhb1UmG=T-5PMMRWGN84RK40FsTR=1XuWcuXO6=Q@mail.gmail.com>

0.8.4 release candidate 2 is available at:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.8.4/test/

This is a maintenance release to fix a critical bug and fix three minor
security issues; it contains very few changes from the 0.8.3 release.

The two changes that need testing:

1) OSX FD_FULLSYNC leveldb corruption fix. If you have had trouble with
database corruption on OSX, please try this release and let us know if it
seems to help. Also let us know if you experience any performance problems
with this release.

2) Bloom filter optimization. If you have code that uses the bloom-filtered
block (merkleblock) protocol, please try it against this release and let us
know if you run into any issues.


PS: a critical last-minute bug was found in release candidate 1; it was
never released.
