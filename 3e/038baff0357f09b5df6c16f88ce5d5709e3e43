But miners dont want to run full nodes, its better to develop some SPV like
that connects to some nodes.

Also I believe that stratum mining protocol improves some performance
things that GBT lacks.

If a new protocol that requires blocks created by miners is developed and
named in a cool way, miners could ask for protocol support to his favourite
pool.
