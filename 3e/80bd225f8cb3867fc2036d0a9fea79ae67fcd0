HAHAHA.   Have you consider doing comedy full time?

Actual BDB files are absolutely not deterministic. Nor is the raw
blockchain itself currently, because blocks aren't always added in the
same order (plus they get orphans in them)

But the serious inter-version compatibility problems as well as poor
space efficiency make BDB a poor candidate for read only pruned
indexes.

The binaries distributed by bitcoin.org are all already compiled
deterministically and validated by multiple independent parties.  In
the future there will be a downloader tool (e.g. for updates) which
will automatically check for N approvals before accepting an update,
even for technically unsophisticated users.

This will produce a full chain of custody which tracks the actual
binaries people fetch to specific source code which can be audited, so
substitution attacks will at least in theory always be detectable. Of
course, you're left with Ken Thompson's compiler attack but even that
can be substantially closed.
