Oh, now I got the 'soft-fork' alternative. If that means that *senders* to
Trezor need to be nice guys and use some special outputs, then it's,

I understand political aspect around hard-fork. Anyway, are there any other
pending projects waiting for hard-fork? Maybe we should join our effort in
some way.
