Electrum uses two large indexes:

     address -> utxo

(patricia tree, aka "ultimate blockchain compression", see thread 
started by Alan Reiner in the bitcointalk forum)

     address -> spent history

The first index is not going to grow larger than what bitcoind already 
needs to store, because bitcoind will always need to store utxos.

The second index threatens to become large. However, Electrum servers do 
not keep the full histories, they prune older entries. Without adapting 
Electrum clients, it would even be possible to keep only one bit per 
address (to know whether that address has been used or not), and that 
information is only used to restore wallets from seed, not during normal 
operations.

If the first index (patricia tree) was implemented in bitcoind, that 
would obviously be a big relief for electrum servers.
