Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP103 to 30MB
Message-ID: <CAJowKgLwAjR9VqzvmR3wsy_p6-F4Mp1X6PUibgpnHUXVA9uUhQ@mail.gmail.com>

If you use this formula, with a decaying percentage, it takes about 100
years to get to 30MB, but never goes past that.

Since it never passes 32, we don't have to worry about going past that
ever... unless another hard fork is done.   A schedule like this could
allow block size to scale with tech growth asymptotically.   Might be nice
to include with other things

P=17%, Pn = P*0.95 X = 1, Xn = X * (1+P)
