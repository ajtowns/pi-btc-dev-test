Anyway, as I've said repeatedly my problem with fee estimation is that
it needs to be combined with some form of transaction replacement to
give users a way to recover from bad estimates, not that I think the
idea shouldn't be implemented at all. After all, we alrady have fee
estimation: wallet authors and users manully estimate fees!

This particular case is a nasty one re: recovering from a bad estimate,
and it's exactly why the payment protocol is designed for the sender to
give the receiver a copy of every transaction they make so the receiver
can be held responsible for getting them mined, eg. with
child-pays-for-parent, out-of-band fee payment, or maybe even by adding
inputs to the transaction. (SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY)
