If you are going to mask bits, would you consider to mask all bits 
except the 4th bit? So other fork proposals may use other bits for 
voting concurrently.

And as I understand, the masking is applied only during the voting 
stage? After the softfork is fully enforced with 95% support, the 
nVersion will be simply >=8, without any masking?
