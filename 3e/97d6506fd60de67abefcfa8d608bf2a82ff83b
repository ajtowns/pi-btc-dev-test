That magic number is something I find very unfortunate and superflous in
BIP-32 design. Its only purpose is to distinguish BIP-32 trees for
various altcoins, but it doesn't make sense at all once you start
storing various altcoins in the same tree using the proposed
/m/cointype/reserved'/account'/change/n scheme.

I would love to see that removed from BIP-32 and use always
0x0488B21E/0x0488ADE4 (xpub/xpriv), but that is for different discussion
I guess.
