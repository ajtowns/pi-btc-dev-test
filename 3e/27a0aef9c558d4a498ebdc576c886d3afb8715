I don't think this is a realistic concern. The incentive compatibility _already_ exists (just in reverse: miners are refusing transactions that would increase their total fees in the next block), and as the mempool is already generally competitive enough it's actually worse the way it is.

But I don't think it makes sense to take a zealous approach on "incentive compatibility". Bitcoin is already built on a whole bunch of incentive incompatible behaviors, even things as simple as "change outputs" (you'd be better off privately giving your transaction to trusted miners without change, who deduct the min fee they would've needed and refund the rest OOB). Not to mention, we expect miners to avoid reorgs and stuff even if it's in their short-term interest.

At least personally, I think DoS risks are the real concern.
