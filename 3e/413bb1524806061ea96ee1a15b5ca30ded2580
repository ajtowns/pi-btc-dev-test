Personally, I'd like to see fewer implicit ties to X509.  With X509 as one 
option.  For example, I'd much prefer to see a doorway to the future left open 
like this:

    message Invoice {
        repeated bytes issuerIdentityType;
        repeated bytes issuerIdentityBytes;

or similar, instead of "x509chain".

In particular two additional identification types:

 - GnuPG (obviously)
 - Hash based

The hash-based system would be there as a method of leveraging an existing 
trusted connection, without needing to get into the nitty-gritty of 
certificates.  For example, I am paying for something on a web site; I 
presumably already have a secure connection that I trust to that site.  That 
site can issue me an invoice (which is to be sent to the bitcoin client) _and_ 
a hash of the certificate on the same page.

I trust that hash because I received it over a secure connection from a 
trusted source.  When my bitcoin client pops up with the received invoice, it 
shows me the hash of the invoice, and I can be sure that it is from the web 
site I thought it was from.

Imagine I'm a (very) small business, I have two or three customers.  I want to 
email one of my customers an invoice.  I don't want to have to get an X509 
certificate, and I don't necessarily know how.  However, I can ring my 
customer up and say "I've generated an invoice with my bitcoin client, it is 
hashed A7DE-521X-9977.  Write that down and confirm it when you get my 
invoice".  Alternatively, I might attach a file called
invoice-A7DE-521X-9977.bitinv to a signed GnuPG email.  The receipient can 
easily confirm I sent it because the filename must match the contents and 
GnuPG protects against tampering.
