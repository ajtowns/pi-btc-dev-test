Reserving my judgement until I've though about it more (design by committee
scares me, and this voting sounds expensive), I think the SPV-verifiable
moving median can be done by binning the space of block size limits, and
for each node in the UTXO tree, a value for each bin is stored which is the
sum of the corresponding bins of each of the children.  The childless nodes
- which correspond to the individual UTXOs - increment the appropriate bin
of their parents according to the rules you mentioned.  The bin values in
the root node of the UTXO tree would then be added to those, weighted
appropriately, of the previous N blocks.

The hash of a node would be that of the bin values, concatenated with the
child nodes' hashes.  In this way, any step of the calculation of the
median would produce a localized error in the UTXO tree that's easily
verified.

The number of bins would have to be kept relatively small in order to keep
this from adding too much data to the UTXO tree branches though.
