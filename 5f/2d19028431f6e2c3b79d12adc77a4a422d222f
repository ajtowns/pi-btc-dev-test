Well yes, but that is true for each of the rules and is already covered by
the previous specification in BIP62. Making it mandatory even for old
transaction does not really protect much against malleability as there are
several other sources of malleability that cannot be made mandatory in old
transactions left.

The reason for including #4 is just "allowing this does not benefit anyone".
