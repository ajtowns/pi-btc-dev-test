A new BIP, as part of the SW softfork, is pending BIP number assignment:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/270

This proposal defines a new transaction digest algorithm for signature 
verification in version 0 and version 1 witness program, in order to 
minimize redundant data hashing in verification (solving the O(n^2) 
issue), and to cover the input value by the signature (a frequently 
requested feature for cold wallet).
