Currently bip99 recommends 95% miner upgrade confirmation with version bits
(bip9) for uncontroversial hardforks just like it does for uncontroversial
softforks. It is true that in the case of hardforks miners don't decide and
it's the whole economy who has to upgrade before activation, but "the whole
economy" and "all users" includes miners, so why not use the only upgrade
confirmation mechanism that we have available?

The way I see it, uncontroversial softforks are also expected to be
upgraded to by everyone eventually. The advantage of softforks is that
non-miners don't need to do it before activation like with hardforks.
That's the only important difference I see between uncontroversial
softforks and hardforks (unilateral softforks and schism hardforks are
another thing though).

Please let's discuss this generally within the context of bip99 instead of
discussing different deployment details with every proposal. There's a
couple of threads in the ml, a couple of now merged bip99 prs in
bitcoin/bips...
