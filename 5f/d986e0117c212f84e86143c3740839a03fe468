A fair point. I'll add some prefixes for testnet.

How does that make sense? Decomposing a key/seed into 1 share is functionally equivalent to dispensing with the secret sharing scheme entirely.

I'll welcome forks of my draft BIP. I don't really have the inclination to research GF(2^8) secret sharing schemes and write an implementation at the present time, but if someone wants to take my BIP in that direction, then okay.
