I've sent out a new pull request
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/102/files) that:
* Changes the order of the rules.
* Adds more reference documentation about minimal pushes and number encodings.
* Clarified that extra consensus rules cannot prevent someone from
creating outputs whose spending transactions will be malleable.

I haven't changed which rules are mandatory in v3, so this is a pure
clarification & reorganization of the text.

Any comments?
