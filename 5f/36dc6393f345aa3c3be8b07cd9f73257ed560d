Why would a new API be needed? (beside maybe some functionality that would
make it easier to integrate)

P2P should be enough for SPV clients such as BitcoinJ to get access to
(filtered) blocks and transations, and RPC can be used to manage/query the
bitcoind instance. I'm not sure what stratum would add.
