The REST API has nothing to do with SPV clients; it's similar to the RPC
interface and won't be exposed to the network as a whole.

Increasing the resource usage by SPV clients on full nodes is undesirable; we
have a lot of work to do regarding DoS attacks. John Dillon's comments here on
using micro-transactions to compensate full-nodes for maintaining expensive
blockchain indexes are worth reading:

In any case UTXO data currently requires you to have full trust in
whomever is providing you with it, and that situation will continue
until UTXO commitments are implemented - if they are implemented.
