This seems like a good place to add in an idea I had about
partially-connected nodes that are able to throttle bandwidth demands.
While we will be having partial-blockchain nodes with a spectrum of
storage options the requirement to be connected is somewhat binary, I
think many users manually throttle by turning nodes on/off already with
a minimum to just keep the chain up to date. A throttling option would
leverage on bitcoin's asychronous design to reduce bandwidth demands for
weaker nodes.

So throttling to allow for a spectrum of bandwidth connectivity:

1) an option for the user -throttle=XXX that would allow the user to
specify a desirable total bandwidth XXX in Gbytes/day the bitcoin client
can use.

2) the client reduces the number of continuous connections, transaction
or block relaying to achieve the desired throttling rate

3) it could do this by being partially connected throughout the duty
cycle or cycling the node on/off for a percentage of a 24(?) hr period

4) have an auto setting where some smart traffic management 'just takes
care of it' and manual settings that can be user configured

5) reduces minimum requirement for any 24(?) hr period it has received a
full copy of all blocks to remain fully-validating

Not sure if anyone has bought such an idea forward or if there are
obvious holes, so pre-emptive apologies for time-wasting if so.
