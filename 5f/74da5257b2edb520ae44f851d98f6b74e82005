It is as impossible to upload a 10 million terabyte block as it is to
download it. But even on a more realistic scale, of say a 2GB block, there
are other factors that prevent a rogue miner from being able to flood the
network using large blocks -- such as the ability to get that block
propagated before it can be orphaned. A simple solution to these large
blocks is for relays to set configurable limits on the size of blocks that
they will relay. If the rogue miner can't get his megablock propagated
before it is orphaned, his attack will not succeed. It doesn't make the
block invalid, just useless as a DoS tool. And over time, relays can raise
the limits they set on block sizes they will propagate according to what
they can handle. As more and more relays accept larger and larger blocks,
the true maximum block size can grow naturally and not require a hard fork.

Yet another issue that can be addressed by allowing relays to restrict
propagation. Relays are just as impacted by large blocks filled with
nonsense as small miners. If a relay downloads a block and sees that it's
full of junk or comes from a miner notorious for producing bad blocks, he
can refuse to relay it. If a bad block doesn't propagate, it can't hurt
anyone. Large miners also typically have to use static IPs. Anonymizing
networks like TOR aren't geared towards handling that type of traffic. They
can't afford to have the reputation of the IPs they release blocks with
tarnished, so why would they risk getting blacklisted by relays?

This same attack could be achieved simply by sending lots of spam
transactions and bloating the UTXO database or the mempool. In fact, given
that block storage is substantially cheaper than UTXO/mempool storage, I'd
be far more concerned with that type of attack. And this particular attack
vector has already been largely mitigated by pruning and could be further
mitigated by allowing relays to decide which blocks they propagate.
