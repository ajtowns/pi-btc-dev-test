Security shouldn't depend on perfect use.  There are many things that
result in multiple key use: Bitcoin address authentication (something
which the pool you created uses!), someone spamming you with multiple
payments to a common address which you didn't solicit (what, are you
just going to ignore the extra coins?), ... or just practical
considerations? I note the mining pool you founded continually pays a
single address for 'fall back' payments when it can't pay in the
coinbase transact, I know you consider that a bug, but its the reality
today.

Most security issues aren't the result of one problem but several
problems combined, so it's important to make each layer strong even if
the strength shouldn't be important due to proper use in other layers.

Fortunately, libsecp256k1 has a nearly constant time/constant memory
access multiply for signing which should reduce exposure substantially
(and is generally built in a way that reduces vulnerabilities).
