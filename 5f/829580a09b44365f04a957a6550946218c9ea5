Mike,

You can not consider the outcome resulting by replace-by-fee fraudulent, as it could be the world as observed by some.

Some other?s might have seen the replaced transaction, but that only indicates for sure that the signer is fraudulent.

What should a node do that really cares of good reputation? Ignore both to be on the safe side?
