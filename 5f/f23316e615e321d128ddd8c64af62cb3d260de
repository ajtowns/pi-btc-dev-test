Agree.

So, my understanding is that atm we have no working DNS seeds at the
testnet3, right? There are two DNS seeds known, of which one is unreachable
atm, and another one is giving just one IP address, which is also a dead
node.

If I'll start a DNS seed of my own and make sure it works well, will this
help?
I've found this DNS seeder daemon <https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder>,
and it seems to be exactly what I need to run a DNS seeder myself.
So if my understanding is correct, I'll setup a DNS seeds for mainnet and
for testnet at bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me and testnet-seed.alexykot.me, and
also a well connected nodes for mainnet and testnet on the same server.
Is this a good plan? Will this all help?


Best regards,
Alex Kotenko
