That's not really realistic. In practice some receivers do big sweeps and include unconfirmed inputs. Replacing the transaction means you need to pay the cost of the sweep, which you probably don't want to do (can be in the order of $100s of dollars).

This applies to pretty much all non-standard transactions.
