Nodes running through networks like cjdns, onion, and i2p can
effectively communicate with no knowledge of the counterparty
whatsoever. Bitcoin does make an assumption that you are connected to
at least one non-partitioned peer, and that there is a cost in having
a large number of sybil nodes in many different ranges. Nothing
says you have to do your communication exclusively on one network or
another, so long as you have *some* source of information which is not
partitioned.
