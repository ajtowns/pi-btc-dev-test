I suspect you may be confusing full nodes with mining nodes. The two are
not directly synonymous. When running a full node in non-mining mode,
the CPU load is fairly light and the GPU is not touched at all. There is
a decent amount of RAM / disk used, but I've found that running a full
node on my low-power NAS box to be a nice way to use the extra idle CPU
time in a somewhat useful way (again, not mining). I've also run a full
node on a netbook without any trouble.

Bitcoin is extremely tolerant of nodes entering and leaving the network
at will. Even part time nodes help to improve the quality of the network
purely by following the rules when passing on blocks / transactions
(i.e. preventing the propogation of erroneous or invalid data and
checking the proof of work of all present chains)

They will need to upgrade, so yes it will affect every node.

This has been thoroughly discussed in other threads. Hard forks are not
done on a whim.
