Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Weekly development meetings on IRC
Message-ID: <20150918010709.GB5251@amethyst.visucore.com>

Hello,

At Monday's code sprint we had a good idea to schedule a regular developer meeting in #bitcoin-dev.

Attendance is of course voluntary, but it may be good to have a time that many people are expected to be present and current issues can be discussed.

Any preference for days/times?

What about e.g. every week 15:00-16:00 UTC on Thursday?

Wladimir
