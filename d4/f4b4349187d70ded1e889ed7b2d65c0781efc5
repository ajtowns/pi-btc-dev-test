Not with this PULL-- I think wallet security and backup is a critical
feature, so that is what this is for.

groffer pointed out that might cause problems when transaction volume
ramps up, because each CHECKMULTISIG counts as 20 sigops, and there is
a limit to the number of sigops you can put into a block. And since it
isn't needed for wallet security and backup I dropped it.

Accepting this does not preclude adding more 'standard' transaction
types in the future.
