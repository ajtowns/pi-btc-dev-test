The plan is to provide the consensus functionality as a library, the
essential parts that make bitcoin bitcoin.
0.10 will have a basic transaction/script verifier available.
In the version after that, I expect this will be extended to further
utxo set management, but no API has been worked out for that yet.
There are also plans to add a library for transaction signing.

However there is no goal to expose *everything* as a library.
Certainly not wallet- or user interface related functionality.
Specialized utility libraries would fill this purpose better.
See for example https://github.com/bitcoin/libbase58 for base58 processing.
