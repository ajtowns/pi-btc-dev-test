Bitcoin is a consensus system. You can't run clients with different rules on 
the same blockchain/network - it just won't work! Maybe we're now talking 
about mere client default policies? In which case, you should be able to 
configure previous behaviour...

If you want just bug fixes and rule changes, without policy default changes, 
new features, etc, you can use the 0.4.x - 0.7.x backports. But be advised 
these are short-term solutions and won't be maintained forever - so you really 
should try to get the behaviour you want from the current release. If you 
can't for some reason, please do report a bug explaining what it is the older 
version was capable of that the new one isn't!
