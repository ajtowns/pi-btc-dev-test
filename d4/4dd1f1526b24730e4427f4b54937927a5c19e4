Oh please.  Checking that a node does relay something is not much 
different than banning it for relaying garbage.

It just happens to require that you have two nodes and coordinate them

properties, and certainly didn't mean to imply that nodes passing a test 
could be trusted (as you suggest with your "accountable parties").
