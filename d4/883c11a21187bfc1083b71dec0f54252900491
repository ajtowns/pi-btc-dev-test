You can prove that it wasn't updated correctly.

For each transaction, the UTXO tree root before and after is committed.

You show the root before, and the root after and show that the after root
is wrong.  You also need to include some merkle paths to prove the
transform.

Yes, you can mostly get short proofs for each step, but you have to make
sure your proofs are also provable.

It means going through everything that needs to be proved for a block to be
valid.
