Sorry, that's to be expected, I shouldn't have asked.

Good point.

I usually test compile / report current and stable of things I use.


So I get that github/master is the obvious top of things.
But in looking at where the tags are between repositories,
it's still not clear to me what the workflow is.

Example...

There are these release tarballs on sourceforge, which all have
tags in github, yet no tags in gitorious. There are no 'x' branches
on github, yet there is one release applicable branch on gitorious.

I guess I'd expect to see, that if as hinted by Luke that gitorious
has the stable trees, that there would be release tags there, laid
down at some comfy point in time on the 'x' stable branches there.
(The stable branches inheriting new code from master). But there
are no such tags.

And the releases/tags seem to magically appear from nowhere on
github :) Again, I'm trying to extricate myself from CVS here.
