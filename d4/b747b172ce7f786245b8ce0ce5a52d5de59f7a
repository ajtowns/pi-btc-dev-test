Good Morning Matt,

It seems to me that double signing can be punished by requiring that R be a trivial function on the blockheight of the block being signed on the sidechain network. Then a validator who signs multiple versions of history at a particular blockheight reveals their privkey. Since the privkey also protects their Bitcoin stake UTXO, they risk loss of their Bitcoin stake. A similar idea is used by Discrete Log Contracts to ensure Oracles do not sign multiple values at a particular time.

Regards,

It's possible there may be an issue with the fact that the Bitcoin is not slashable (although their voting power is), meaning a validator who double-signs cannot have their Bitcoin removed from them. However their UTXO can be blacklisted which does make their attack costly since they lose out on the time-value of their stake.
