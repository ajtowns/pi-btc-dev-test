Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Towards Massive On-Chain Scaling: Presenting Our
	Block Propagation Results With Xthin
Message-ID: <6C8764CD-81D4-4F05-A3B0-008A267EEE23@gmx.com>

Dear all,

For the past two months, Andrew Clifford, Andrew Stone, @sickpig, Peter Tschipper and I have been collecting empirical data regarding block propagation with Xthin???both across the normal P2P network and over the Great Firewall of China. We have six Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) nodes running, including one located in Shenzhen and another in Shanghai, and we have collected data on the transmission and reception for over nine thousand blocks.

Here is a link to Part 1(Methodology) of our 5 part article series on the testing we performed for this exciting new block relay technology:

We thank Jihan Wu from AntPool for the block source within Mainland China and @cypherdoc for the funding.  

Best regards,
Peter
