Thanks for investigating this. I guess it's my fault for not checking
the diff before the final merge. I guess the simultaneous switch to a
git-subtree'd leveldb made it harder to review.

In any case, the changes seem harmless, but I think we should revert
to a codebase as close as possible to upstream LevelDB 1.12. The diff
you have between bitcoin head and bitcoin-up shows a few reverted
patches that we included during 0.9's merge window, a patch by ripple
to add a compaction delay (which they seem to have reverted now too)
and one weird ripple-specific commit (which just seems to remove
issue178_test.cc).

I've put a cleaned-up history of the LevelDB subtree in the
http://github.com/bitcoin/leveldb repository (branch bitcoin-fork),
and then used git-subtree to create a pull request (#2907) which
switches our src/leveldb directory to this tree. It correctly lists
the reverted (and sometimes re-applied) changes in the squashed commit
(please review!). The actual diff corresponds to the diff you
produced, with the reverted changes in our repository re-applied.
