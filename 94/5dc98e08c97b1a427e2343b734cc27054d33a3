Oh I see, you expect the sign of the dE/dx to change depending on
whether fees exceed the subsidy. This is possible, but instead of the
linear identity, you have to increase the block size twice as fast as
the difficulty. In that case we would get (using the notations of my
previous email):

D' = D(1+x)
F' = F(1+2x)

and thus:

E' - E = x/(1+x)P(F-S)

The presence of the (F-S) factor means that the sign reversal occurs
when fees exceed subsidy.
