Subject: [bitcoin-dev] New lower policy limits for unconfirmed transaction
	chains or packages
Message-ID: <CAPWm=eXjDDYcOLgZREn6b6rnfWcYGfv5pG--VyRmCMDaL_ge-g@mail.gmail.com>

I just wanted to let everyone know that after much considered review, new
lower policy limits on the number and size of related unconfirmed
transactions that will be accepted in to the mempool and relayed have been
merged into the master branch of Bitcoin Core for 0.12 release.

The actual limits were merged in PR 6771
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6771> and discussion of these
limits can be found in this previous email
<https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010221.html>
to the dev list and discussion of the new lower limits here
<https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-October/011401.html>
.

The new limits are:
25 unconfirmed ancestors
25 unconfirmed descendants
101kb total size with unconfirmed ancestors
101kb total size with unconfirmed descendants.

These limits are just policy and do not affect consensus.
They can be modified by command line arguments.


Thanks,
Alex
