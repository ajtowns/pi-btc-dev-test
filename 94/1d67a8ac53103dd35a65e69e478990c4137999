Unicode guarantees that null-terminated strings still work.  U+0000
terminates a unicode (or C) string.  strlen() gets the string byte
count.  mbstowcs() gets the character count.

Whitespace can be problematic, but should be allowed.  Control
characters should be filtered.  Emoticons probably cannot be filtered
without substandard approaches such as character blacklists, a road
you do not want to travel.

(all this is simply standard practice)
