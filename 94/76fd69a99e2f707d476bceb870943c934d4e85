Hi Justus,

I read your proposal for a bitcoin darknet (friend-to-friend), but I?m
not on that list, so it would be nice if you could relay my message.

This argumentation does not apply to the friend-to-friend connections
in Freenet, though, because in Retroshare you need friends to be
connected at all, while in Freenet adding Friends is optional. They
were made optional in direct response to seeing people exchange
friend-references with strangers.

An important aspect of friend-to-friend connections is that they have
to provide additional value for the communication with real-life
friends. I had few darknet contacts in Freenet until I started using
messages to friends for confidential communication (in which freenet
traffic provides a cover for the direct communication with friends).

For details on confidential messaging as additional value see ?Let us
talk over Freenet, so I can speak freely again?:

And for a description of capabilities freenet builds on top of the
friend-to-friend connections, see ?Freenet: The forgotten cryptopunk
paradise?:

Best wishes,
Arne
