One use case should be enough.  The atomic cross chain proposal has been
discussed for a while.  It feels like bitcoin works on an "ask permission
first" basis.

It always stalls at the fact that non-standard transactions are hard to get
confirmed on other coins.  It is hard to find pools on other coins which
have weaker isStandard() checks.  The timeouts have to be set so that they
are long enough to guarantee that transactions are accepted before they
expire.

A testnet to testnet transfer is the best that would be possible at the
moment.

I don't think the cross chain system needs a BIP (except to justify this
one).

If cross chain transfer become popular, then it would be useful to ensure
that clients are interoperable, but first things first.  If the
transactions aren't accepted in any chains, then everything stalls.

Secure transfers require that the malleability issue is fixed, but that is
a separate issue.  I am assuming that will be fixed at some point in the
future, since micro-payment channels also requires that it is fixed.

It could be restricted to only P2SH, I don't think there would be a loss in
doing that.

Personally, I would make it so that P2SH is mandatory after a certain
time.  It makes distributed verification of the block chain easier.
Everything needed to verify a script is present in the transaction (except
that the output actually exists).

A soft fork that expands P2SH functionality would be even better, but I
would rather not let the best be the enemy of the good.
