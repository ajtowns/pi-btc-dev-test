Ehm, I though those discussions about "ASICs are bad, because X" ended
years ago by starting "ASIC unfriendly" altcoins. ASIC industry is twisted
even without AsicBoost. I don't see any particular reason why to change
rules just because of 10% edge.

This is opening Pandora box and it is potentially extremely dangerous for
the health of the network. You cannot know in advance what you'll break by
changing the rules.

Disclaimer: I don't have any stake in any ASIC company/facility.
