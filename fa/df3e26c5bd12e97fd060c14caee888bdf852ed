So lets rephrase that and say instead more correctly it is the job of
miners (collectively) to be well connected globally - and indeed there
are incentivised to be or they tend to receive blocks at higher
latency and so are at increased risk of orphans.  And miner groups
with good block latency in-group and high hashrate are definitionally
the well connected, so the cost of getting good connectivity to high
hashrate groups is naturally borne by people outside of those groups.
Or thats the incentive anyway.
