On the specific issue I raised, the BIP only says "Querying multiple
nodes and combining their answers can be a partial solution to this"
which is not very helpful advice.  That's a partial answer to my
question #2 with zero response for question #3.

This sort of thing really needs a warning label like "use only if you
don't have a trusted solution" and discussion of that choice is
completely absent (question #1).
