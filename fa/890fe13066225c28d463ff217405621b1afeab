It already happens with 8 peers that if you have lousy peers, the
transaction doesn't reach the network on the first broadcasting. When
sending to only one random peer it will likely be even worse.

I guess the wallet could send out the transaction 'staggered' over
time. It could pick a random new node, broadcast the transaction, wait
a bit, pick a new node, broadcast the transaction until it is comes
back through one of the other peers.

Separating the transaction broadcasting (of the wallet) from, for
example, the nodes used to request blocks from could make sense. Maybe
doubly so if bloom filters are involved.
