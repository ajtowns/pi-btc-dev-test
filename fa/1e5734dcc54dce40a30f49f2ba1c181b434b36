Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Revocability with known trusted escrow
 services?

The two most basic ways would be simply:

(1) You create your transactions having a locktime of X days and has
sequence numbers such that it can be replaced exactly once.  The
replacement, can be executed within 30 days.

(2) You simply send money to 1-of-2 transactions:  me-or-you.  If the
person who is receiving it wants it, they have to sign for it by sending
it to one of their own single-sig addresses.  Otherwise, you can return
it to yourself at some point in the future.

I don't totally understand the goal, and how/if these solutions actually
achieve such goal.  But it does add a way for transactions to exist a
non-final state for some amount of time.  But in both cases,
accessibility is still binary:  you have complete access to it, until
you don't.   Which might be seen as the point of irrevocable transfer.
