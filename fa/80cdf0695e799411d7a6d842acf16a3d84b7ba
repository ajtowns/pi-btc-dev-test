Obviously those who claim that you or "committers" or "developers" are
in control of the consensus rules are far from understanding this
life-threatening part. If you, Gavin or anyone becomes "the president
of bitcoin" he will likely get killed, or kidnapped, or get his family
kidnapped, or tortured...

I fully agree with what you've said but there's an argument I
sympathize with: "hardforks must be possible". Otherwise it seems that
the system is "eventually obsolete by design".
Provided they're also uncontroversial, they don't need to be that
different (in terms of deployment) from softforks. Since they risks
are bigger you just need to give more time for users and alternative
software to upgrade.
I would really like deploying an uncontroversial hardfork to prove
nobody wants them to be impossible, as explained in:
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/008936.html

I hear people claiming that "hardforks must be possible" here and
there, see this example:
