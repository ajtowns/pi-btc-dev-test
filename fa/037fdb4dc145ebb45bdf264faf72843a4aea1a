This circles back to Problem #1:   Avoidance of a choice is a still a
choice - failing to ACK a MAX_BLOCK_SIZE increase still creates very real
Economic Change Event risk.

And #3:  If the likely predicted course is that Bitcoin Core will not
accept a protocol change changing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE via hard fork in the short
term, the core dev team should communicate that position clearly to users
and media.

Hitting a Fee Event is market changing, potentially reshuffling economic
actors to a notable degree.  Maintaining a short term economic policy of
fixed 1M supply in the face of rising transaction volume carries risks that
should be analyzed and communicated.
