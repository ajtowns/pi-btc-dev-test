This isn't about "everyone's coffee".  This is about an absolute minimum
amount of participation by people who wish to use the network.   If our
goal is really for bitcoin to really be a global, open transaction
network that makes money fluid, then 7tps is already a failure.  If even
5% of the world (350M people) was using the network for 1 tx per month
(perhaps to open payment channels, or shift money between side chains),
we'll be above 100 tps.  And that doesn't include all the
non-individuals (organizations) that want to use it.

The goals of "a global transaction network" and "everyone must be able
to run a full node with their $200 dell laptop" are not compatible.  We
need to accept that a global transaction system cannot be
fully/constantly audited by everyone and their mother.  The important
feature of the network is that it is open and anyone *can* get the
history and verify it.  But not everyone is required to.   Trying to
promote a system where the history can be forever handled by a low-end
PC is already falling out of reach, even with our miniscule 7 tps. 
Clinging to that goal needlessly limits the capability for the network
to scale to be a useful global payments system
