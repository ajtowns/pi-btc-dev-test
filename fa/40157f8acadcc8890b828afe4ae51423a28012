I am not following you here, can you explain what you're thinking?

Because this would make it impossible for nodes to prune the vaules.
They'd all forever have to keep a set of all the coinbase hashes in
order to perform the test. The height-in-coinbase BIP will make
duplicates effectively impossible to create, which is a much more
clean behavior.
