It's been known so long ago that I incorrectly thought the attack was ok to
discuss in public; I had apparently incorrectly remembered a conversation I had
with Greg Maxwell over a year ago where I thought he said it was fine to
discuss because it was well known.

My apologies to anyone who thinks my post was jumping the gun by discussing
this in public; cats out of the bag now anyway.

My post is arguing that we *don't* need to fix the attack, because we can make
pruned nodes invulerable to it while retaining the ability to verify merkle
path tx inclusion proofs.

As for SPV, there is no attack to fix: they can be attacked at much lower cost
by simply generating fake blocks.
