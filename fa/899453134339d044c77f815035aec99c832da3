I live in Argentina. Here, 1BTC is around half of a monthly average
wage (net), so, as you
can imagine, the value of 1 BTC is *very* inconvenient  for everyday
transactions.

 Also it presents an important entry barrier for new adopters: It would be
easier to accept buying thousands of "bits" than buying a tiny fraction
of a Bitcoin, for the same amount of pesos.

Changing to 1e-6 "bits" will solve both problems. Changing to 1e-6
"microbitcoins" will
solve the first one, but not sure about the second one. Buying (or
earning) mili or micro
something  isn't that sexy either.

Finally, against "micro" and in favor of "bits", micro is noted "?",
which is also
 inconvenient (I had to copy and paste it from an other site). Many
different notations will be used like:  ?BTC, uBTC,  "microBTC" and
even "mBTC".
Please prevent that.

These arguments also applies to many places in the  world (Argentina
is 40 out of 72 listed countries in
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage).
