I'm very confused.

Let's say, out of the 12,000 blocks in a voting period:
? 1000 blocks express no preference,
? 2000 blocks vote to halve the limit,
? 3500 blocks vote to double the limit, and
? 5500 blocks vote to keep the limit the same.

 The plurality vote is to keep the limit the same. The median vote is? well, I'm not sure, since there are four choices, and an average of the two "middle" choices doesn't seem to make sense.
