I remember the wordlist choice getting bikeshedded to death a month ago.

I would just include the wordlist as part of the standard (as a
recommendation) so that fully compliant implementations can correct a
user's typos regardless of the original generator.

Those who don't like it will have to deal with the compatibility
concerns themselves, or get an alternate wordlist approved as a BIP.
Odds are no one will go that route.
