The MultiBit HD view is that this is a locale-sensitive presentation issue.
As a result we offer a simple configuration panel giving pretty much every
possible combination: icon, m+icon,  ?+icon, BTC, mBTC,  ?BTC, XBT,
mXBT,  ?XBT, sat along
with settings for leading/trailing symbol, commas, spaces and points. This
allows anyone to customise to meet their own needs beyond the offered
default.

We apply the NIST guidelines for representation of SI unit symbols (i.e no
conversion to native language, no RTL giving icon+m etc).

Right now MultiBit HD is configured to use m+icon taken from the Font
Awesome icon set. However reading earlier posts it seems that ?+icon is
more sensible.

Let us know what you'd like.
