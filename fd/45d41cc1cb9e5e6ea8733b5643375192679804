Maybe we should define "the bitcoin economy" is first. In my
definition, miners are definitely part of the economy (and also users
of the system).

Miners accept bitcoins as payment for a real service (with real costs
like electricity) to the network: extending the longest valid chain
with their proof of work.
In the context of BIP99, there's no concept of "an economic majority"
deciding hardforks. Hardforks are either uncontroversial, in which
case BIP99 recommends 95% miner upgrade confirmation in addition to a
time threshold, or are schism hardforks (for example, an anti-miner
hardfork), in which case BIP99 recommends using a time threshold
alone. But no majority can force the dissenting users to use one
validation rule set or the other: users will always be free to run
whatever free software they like.

That alone seems like a very good reason in favor to confirm that
miners have upgraded in addition to a minimal activation block median
time, not a reason against it

I'm not sure I understand this. The trigger mechanism must be uniform
for each rule change, it cannot be optionally different or consensus
can fail.
How are miners supposed to "perceive" adoption?
The time threshold must be set enough in the future to give users time
to upgrade. But we can perceive miners' adoption, so if the system
knows they haven't upgraded, it should wait for them to upgrade (it
would be nice to have an equivalent mechanism to wait for the rest of
the users, but unfortunately there's none).
Please, remember that this is in the context of uncontroversial
hardforks for which all users (including all miners) are expected to
upgrade to.
To reiterate, schism hardforks are treated differently and the miner
upgrade confirmation becomes completely irrelevant.
