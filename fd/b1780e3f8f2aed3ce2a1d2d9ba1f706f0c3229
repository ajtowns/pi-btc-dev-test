Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed new P2P command and response:
	getcmds, cmdlist
Message-ID: <CA+8xBpdD31koaVBh1RuDZKH1sygr8z10K=bPz8DepqYOa8i6yg@mail.gmail.com>

Outside of major features advertised network-wide in nService bits,
P2P protocol lacks a good method of enumerating minor features or
extensions.  The version number increment is coarse-grained, and is
not self-documenting.  A simple extension which lists supported
commands is added, as demonstrated in this pull request:

     https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1471

Another option is for verack to return this information at login,
eliminating the need for a separate command/response.
