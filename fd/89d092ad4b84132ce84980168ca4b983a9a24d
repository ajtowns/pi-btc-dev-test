You're missing something really critical about what F2Pool/AntPool were
(are?) doing: They're finding out about new blocks not by getting block
headers from just anywhere, but by connecting to other pools' via
stratum anonymously and determining what block hash they're telling the
hashers at the pool to work on. (e.g. what prevblockhash is in the block
header of shares being generated)

If other pools try to fake this information they're immediately and
directly losing money, because they're telling their own hashers to make
invalid blocks. This of course has a high chance of being detected, and
can easily be FUDed into "STOP MINING AT FOO POOL!" reardless of what
the ivory tower game theory might say. The only hope the pools have is
to somehow identify which connections correspond to other pools with
high reliability and target just those connections - good luck on that.


Anyway, all this concern about SPV mining is misguided: relying purely
on SPV w/ low #'s of confirmations just isn't very smart. What SPV can
do - at least while the inflation subsidy is still high - is give
reasonable protection against your third-party-run trusted full nodes
from lying to you, simply because doing so has well-defined costs in
terms of energy to create fake blocks. Targetting enough people at once
to make a fake block a worthwhile investment is difficult, particularly
when you take into account how timing works in the defenders favor - the
attacker probably only has a small % of hashing power, so they're going
to wait a long time to find their fake block. Between that and a trusted
third party-run full node you're probably reasonably safe, for now.
