So, seems to me that RCLTV opens up a whole rats nest of design
decisions and compromises that CLTV doesn't. Yet CLTV itself is a big
step forward, it's been implemented on Viacoin for the past few months
with no issues found, and has an extremely simple and easy to audit
implementation.

I think I'm going to argue we implement it as-is in a soft-fork. Pieter
Wuille's been working on a new way to handle soft-fork upgrades in the
block nVersion field, so this would be a good opportunity to add
something simple and well tested, and also make sure the new nVersion
soft-fork mechanism works. Equally, doing both at the same time ensures
we don't burn yet another version bit.
