For the reasons listed
here(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0091.mediawiki#Motivation)
you should have it so that the HF can not lock in unless the existing
BIP141 segwit deployment is activated.

The biggest issue is that a safe HF is very unlikely to be able to be
coded and tested within 6 months.
