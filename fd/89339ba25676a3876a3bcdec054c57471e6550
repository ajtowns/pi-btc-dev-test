I would like to add for the record, I also warned Gavin of this in his
PR to Bitcoin Core, and also suggested a timeout which if
activation/enforcement did not occur within, hard fork deployment
would be cancelled. His response was to delete these from the PR
claiming thresholds were not relevant conversation in his PR and
belonged elsewhere (even though they had already been discussed
elsewhere).
