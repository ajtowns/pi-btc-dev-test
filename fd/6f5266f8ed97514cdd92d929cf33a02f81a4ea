   1. Data centers are not some uniform group of businesses with identical
   policies nor firms with identical laws applied. The ability to get a search
   warrant at a Swedish hosting provider will be dramatically different than a
   Singaporean business. Similar to the decentralized nature of bitcoin, these
   businesses are independent and varied - it would be difficult for
   authorities to conduct a widescale attack on nodes worldwide, especially
   given current laws. It would also be ineffective since any hacked/seized
   host can be replaced quickly with a competitor service in a different
   jurisdiction.
   2. Personal residences and non-data center businesses are not immune to
   theft, blackmail, seizure, hacking, etc. Depending upon the adversary and
   method of attack, many users would be no worse off with their nodes not
   located on premise. As alluded to above, it's a lot easier and less costly
   to spin up a new 3rd party host than it is to replace a stolen laptop.

There is nothing inherently wrong with data centers/hosting providers
playing a significant (but not central) role in decentralized services.
Users who choose to use a VPS are not contributing to bitcoin in some sort
of inferior capacity. I'll posit that 3rd party providers are not an ideal
place to hold private keys, but that is off topic.
