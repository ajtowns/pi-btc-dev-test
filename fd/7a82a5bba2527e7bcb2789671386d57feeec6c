It's just as easy to steal emails via a BGP or DNS redirect anyway.. 
you could even take over the actual domain at the registry level by 
stealing a password reset via BGP or DNS redirect and actually many 
registries will hand over control of a domain by faxing them a forged 
driving license in the owner's name anyway so it doesn't even really 
need to be a particularly sophisticated attacker. Once you have registry 
control of the domain it's easy enough to get an SSL cert too, probably 
even an 'extended validation' one.

When Afghanistan was taken over the entire .af TLD was probably 
transferred using a forged fax to ICANN

but I guess that's a little different :p
