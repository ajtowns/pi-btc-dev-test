This is in fact useful. The centralized registries themselves are fine
provided that we don't rely on having only one of them or in them
having the same values for the same chains.
Trezor can maintain its own too.
Future versions of Trezor could support full chain IDs instead of
these integers (or keep using these integers forever, whatever they
chose to do).

Can you read my reasoning here?
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-September/010861.html
What I propose is retro-compatible, even for carelessly designed
chains (that allowed pre-mining) like FTC.
And provides securely unique IDs that don't require a centralized registry.

Maybe I should start a Chain IDs BIP...
