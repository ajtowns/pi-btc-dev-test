The median is used here because that is the consensus rule -- a block
cannot have a timestamp older than the median time of the last 11 blocks.
By linking the changeover to this rule we avoid perverse incentives about
miners lying in their timestamps, or the threshold being crossed, then
reverted, then crossed again, etc.

Maybe a different percentile would have been a better choice, but that ship
sailed in 2009. The rule is what it is right now, and we benefit the most
from using the same rule as consensus for the threshold.
