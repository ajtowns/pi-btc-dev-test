I expected you to know this, but ok, I'll explain.

A policy rule is not a protocol rule, a mining node is certainly not 
guarenteet to have it, and those that do typically make it configurable.

If you depend on one implementation and user configuration for the avoidance 
of chain forks, you are going to have a hard time.

Thanks for your thoughtful reply, though.
