If github were to be abandoned for anything, it'd make sense to move code
review and bug tracking elsewhere. GitHub does a reasonably good job of
hosting git repositories. It kind of sucks at code review and the issue
tracker is rudimentary at best. These days you can do "log in with my
github account" so if done well, it'd not have to be very painful.

JetBrains make great stuff and they have a code review and repository
exploration tool called Upsource in development, which should come out
soon. I think it's proprietary but that would be no different to github,
and it's designed for self hosting.
