Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Non-confirming block signalling
Message-ID: <1493983489.1448140.966773912.17FBAAC0@webmail.messagingengine.com>

I propose a method to mark blocks to indicate that they were generated
without verifying the previous block. This can be done by using a bit of
the version field.

This would counter the reduction of security caused by what is known as
"SPV-mining".

The BIP is here:
