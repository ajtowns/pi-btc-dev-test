There are many people interested in starting new services and who are 
interested in hiring developers or at least partnering with them.  This 
is an important part of the ecosystem.  I have noticed both here and on 
Reddit that when someone proposes an idea it goes one of two ways: 
either there is a large amount of interest if the person is well known 
or liked or; the person is accused of being a spammer or made fun of if 
they are not well known or liked.  All this does is make the developers 
look like a small fickle group who actively promote Bitcoin as a an 
insiders' club (much like the Fed).  There should probably be a list 
where people can actively discuss proposed or ongoing projects and look 
for developers to hire.
