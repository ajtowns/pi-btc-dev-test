Yeah, something like HTTP would work well.

I'm really looking forward to this. Currently bitcoinj gets a small but
steady stream of bug reports of the form "my transaction did not
propagate". It's flaky because the library picks one peer to send the
transaction to, and then watches it propagate across the network. But if
that selected peer refuses the tx for whatever reason, that propagation
never comes, and there's currently no timeout to make it retry with a
different node. The transactions as created usually look fine, so it's not
clear to me why some nodes would accept it others wouldn't given the
absence of double spends, and there's no way to debug and find out :(
