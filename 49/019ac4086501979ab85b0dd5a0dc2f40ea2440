I don't think it would be entirely unfair to describe one of the
possible ways a secondary coin becoming unbacked can play out as
inflation? after all, people have described altcoins as inflation. In
the worst case its no _worse_ inflation, I think, than an altcoin is?
however.

I think that chain geometries which improve the scale/decentralization
trade-off are complementary. If PT's ideas here do amount to something
that gives better scaling without ugly compromise I believe it would
still be useful no matter how well the 2-way peg stuff works simply
because scaling and decenteralization are both good things which we
would pretty much always want more of...
