Hi, and thanks for the detailed issue report.

This was a known issue in test code that is only compiled when
debugging. It will be fixed in the upcoming 0.16.2 and 0.17.0
releases.

If you see any further issues, note that we track technical issues
related to the Bitcoin Core code base on our issue tracker:
