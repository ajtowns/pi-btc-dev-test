This isn't really that clear.

Arguably as long as the effort to find a block is proportional to the block
difficulty parameter, then it isn't an exploit.  It is just an optimisation.

A quantum computer, for example, could find a block with effort
proportional to the square root of the difficulty parameter, so that would
count as an attack.  Though in that case, the fix would likely be to tweak
the difficulty parameter update calculation.

A better definition would be something like "when performing work, each
hash should be independent".

ASICBOOST does multiple checks in parallel, so would violate that.
