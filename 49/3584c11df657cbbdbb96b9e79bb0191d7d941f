Subject: [Bitcoin-development] floating fees statistics

Hi

I've looked into this new floating fees algorithm. What I've started
is an ipython notebook to gather data and look into some statistics.
Right now it's probably not so exciting because the rules aren't
active, but maybe someone is interested in this or wants to extend it
a bit.

notebook:

The probably most interesting graph is the one attached. It's the time
series of the estimated fees per confirmation level over the course of
4 hours. The vertical green lines indicate where new blocks have been
found.
