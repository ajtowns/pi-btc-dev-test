Just replying to this one comment: yes, some interaction is always
necessary, but not necessarily directly with the entity hosting the wallet.
There are some EC crypto tricks to do this (often mentioned under
"deterministic wallets" before):

The wallet-hosting entity has a private key x, with public key X.
The address-generating entity knows X, and generates a fresh private
key y for each transaction. For each, it calculates Z=y*X, and asks
the client to pay to hash160(Z). Afterwards, it can send a bunch of
y's to the wallet hosting service, which can reconstruct z=y*x for
each. Alternatively, the y's can be generated according to a predefined
scheme instead.
