Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Looking for GREAT C++ developer for
 exciting opportunity in bitcoin space
Message-ID: <CAJqsvLC8KX04ZFLzntOecnWtN_mFeH6iTPQJp4_hv4StrVVh2w@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

I doubt this list is for this kind of thing. I am following
bitcoin-development since a long time but never participated because I
believe discussions should be well-focused and I never had anything
relevant to say.
Evan, I am pretty sure that emails such as yours will cause the true
discussions between core-dev (or those closely graviting around) to
move elsewhere on a less public channel, where people like me won't be
able to follow them anymore. Thus my request: please post this kind of
things elsewhere, because you are hijacking a list just to target his
audience, but not to contribute relevant content. (A definition
usually describing spam).

Cheers,

Jeremie
