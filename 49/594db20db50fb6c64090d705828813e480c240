>>if the community wishes to adopt (by unanimous consensus) a 2 MB block
size hardfork, this is probably the best way to do it right now... Legacy
Bitcoin transactions are given the witness discount, and a block size limit
of 2 MB is imposed.<<


The above decision may quickly become very controversial. I don't think it's
what most users had/have in mind when they discuss a "2MB+SegWit" solution.

With the current 1MB+SegWit, testing has shown us that normal usage results
in ~2 or 2.1MB blocks.

I think most users will expect a linear increase when Base Size is
increased to 2000000 bytes and Total Weight is increased to 8000000 bytes.
With normal usage, the expected results would then be ~4 or 4.2MB blocks.

Am I missing something here, or does Luke's suggested 2MB cap completely
nullify that expected linear increase? If so, why? What's the logic behind
this decision?

I'd love to be armed with a good answer should my colleagues ask me the
same obvious question, so thank you ahead of time!

Respectfully,
