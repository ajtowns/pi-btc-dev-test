Bitcoin is an irreversible payment system.  When you pay someone using its
main selling point, which is removing the need for physical presence, you
are trusting that person.  Bitcoin doesn't obviate trust.  It obviates
authority.  Centralization of trust is what creates the authority that we
all recognize as bad for our species.  It does this by making the
authority's use of coercion acceptable.

Bitcoin removes the need for authority, not trust.  It replaces trust in a
single body with trust in a majority.  We want that majority to be healthy
and varied (as opposed to largely co-opted by some authority). The
replacement has two effects.  1) It is very difficult for any single body
to become the (coercive) authority that everyone has to trust (like central
banks). 2) It is very easy for a person to find a different single body to
trust if they don't like the one they are trusting now - or even stop
trusting one body and trust the majority instead, relying on #1 for
protection, and taking on the responsibility of running a full node.

The philosophical foundation of a thing is ultimately the basis of its
value, so I thought it useful to point out the distinction between
authority and trust in the bitcoin ecosystem.  I welcome disagreements with
my philosophical position, as that is how I learn.

Dave.
