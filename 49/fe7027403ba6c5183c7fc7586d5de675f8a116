I agree, but if we don't quantify "demand" then we are practically blind. What is the plan? To wait until SPV clients start lagging / timing out because their requests cannot be handled by the nodes?

For all I know, the network would run just fine on 100 nodes. But not knowing really irks me as an engineer.
