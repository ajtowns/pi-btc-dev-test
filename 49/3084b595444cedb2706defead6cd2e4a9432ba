You wouldn't need to pipeline the requests, just place more than one inventory vector in get data, right? Well my messages would save the space of those inventory vectors. Instead of needing 36 byte inventory vectors for each transaction and a var int, you would need two var ints only. And then the transaction responses only need one header, so you save 24 bytes for each transaction after the first. You could say that is a small benefit.

Well it depends on wether you seriously think bitcoin blocks should be limited at a million bytes or not.

Look at bittorrent. With bittorrent you don't download files from a single peer all at once.

Why wouldn't requesting minimum fees in the software work as is done currently?

So what you essentially suggest is having bitcoin banks that maintain trust through Open Transaction contracts which contains proof of agreement, providing some legal protection? One wonders why have bitcoin at all then? Why not have an elaborate e-money system between several banks using Open Transactions? Bitcoin doesn't just contain proof of if something was done right or not, it contains actual certainty that it will be done right. And how does Open Transactions prevent fractional reserve fraud?

I suppose when people consider bitcoin banks, they will consider bitcoin being useless.

Set the change to occur at some block in the future leaving time for people to upgrade. Send out alert messages to notify users to upgrade. Issue is, some people might not like the change for whatever reasons.

As far as I see it, if bitcoin won't scale, then it's worth looking at something different to bitcoin that will scale.
