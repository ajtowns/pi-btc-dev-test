Note that one of the reasons why this is insecure is because EC point
addition is invertible.  EC-scalar multiplication is not, thus why EC
Diffie-Hellman is secure even when this asymmetry exists.

A good cryptosystem doesn't have strange restrictions, like "your public
key can only be public sometimes, but needs to protected like your
private key other times."  If you have to worry about things like that,
you're doing it wrong :)
