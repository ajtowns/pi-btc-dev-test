The less centralized decision making there is, the better. All confirmed
votes will be added to each BIP, so everyone can make their own decision as
to whether or not they want to count it. Remember, this is about gauging
community support.

Rogue employees?: The company in question would have to deal with that.

Mountains out of mole hills here?if the domain name is registered after
voting is called, that would be a pretty clear indicator it's a fake
company.

After further consideration, and as the goal of this is to determine what
the community will support, developers won't have a confirmed vote. They
would get a standard vote though, just like everyone else.
