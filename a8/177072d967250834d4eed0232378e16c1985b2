Hi Tim,

Just read through your post, thanks for the heads up - I only just joined
this mailing list.

In a post-quantum world, your second "d" type transaction is completely
forgeable, which means it is vulnerable to front-running. An adversary
capable of breaking ECDSA needs only listen for these transactions, obtain
"classic_sk" and then use a higher fee (or relationship with a miner) to
effectively turn your original "d" transaction into a double-spend, with
the forged transaction sending all your funds to the adversary.

I'm pretty confident that a PQ DSA is required to prevent front-running,
and that no "commit-reveal" scheme will be secure without one.

The other issue with your approach is that if it is rolled out today, it
will effectively double transaction volumes - this is what I tried to solve
in solutions 2 and 3 in my article by instead modifying the address
generation process.

Regards,

Tristan
