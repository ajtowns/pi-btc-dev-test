I've created a simulation framework called simbit to simulate the selfish
mining attack, though it is general enough to simulate any p2p network. I
even put together a rough simulation of MinCen. The goal is to be fun/easy
to rapidly prototype protocols and strategies, and visualize them. It's
written in javascript, so it can be demoed in the web browser or run on
Node.

It's still in early alpha and a lot of things are missing.
