Is it? Surely the trezor can bruteforce, say, 8 bits == 0. How many
SHA256/sec can the trezor hardware do? Generating your seed is a
one-time thing after all - that taking 10-30s doesn't seem like a big
deal to me.

Even a 1/256th "checksum" will really cut down on the number of mistakes
made and money lost.
