I don't think the nodes that you are connecting to that have this
behavior are actually forked from Bitcoin Core. It seems more like fake
nodes - nodes that don't actually do any verification or follow the
protocol. Such fake nodes can set whatever user agent they want, common
ones being Bitcoin Core's user agents.

IMO your best solution would be to drop peers for protocol noncompliance.
