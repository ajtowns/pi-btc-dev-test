I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this. I plan on using the method
described on this page http://doc.qt.digia.com/3.1/i18n.html under "Use
QString::arg() for Simple Arguments" and then just putting a %1 and %2 in
the translation strings and substituting for value and unit, respectively.
Haven't tested it yet, but that's what I plan to do.

Where do you want the constant defined? In main.h alongside MIN_TX_FEE
and MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE?
