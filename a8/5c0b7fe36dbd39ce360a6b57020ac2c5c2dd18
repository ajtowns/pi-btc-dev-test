 clearly define what you need done to increase block size to a static 8MB,

Michael, I snipped some of your comparison example to comment. I agree
with your sentiment to lobby for testing the change and your offer to
provide resources, yet it presents some (surmountable) challenges:

Peter Todd, on 23/06/15, proposed a combined back-test and ongoing
forward test as follows:

"... the creation (via reorg) of a realistic full-load blockchain on
testnet to fully test the real-world behavior of the entire
infrastructure ecosystem, including questions like the scalability of
block explorers, SPV wallets, feasibility of initial syncronization,
scalability of the UTXO set, etc. While this is of course inconvenient
- - 2 years of 8MB blocks is 840GB worth of data..."

So, with a working dataset of that size, jumping to 8MB is excluding a
lot of participants and contributors to the testing - someone like
myself for example.

And this then leads back to the core issue: if an 8MB blocksize
excludes many on this list from testnet, then the proposed 8MB blocks
will exclude a lot of mainnet participants (miners) and degrade the
quality of diversity and decentralization.

How about testing at double the capacity: 2MB?
