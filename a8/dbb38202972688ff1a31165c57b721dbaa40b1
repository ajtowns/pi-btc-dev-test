Then of course I tried to do this with BIP 10 
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0010.mediawiki> when
Armory implemented offline-transactions two years ago.  I got some
positive feedback, but no one wanted to help improve it, etc.  I guess
nobody else was doing it and/or cared at the time.  So I continue to use
BIP 10 even though it's pretty crappy.  I wanted it to be useful for
multisig, too, but it has some deficiencies there (it was done when
Armory was extremely young and OP_EVAL was still on the table).

However, with all this activity, we should start thinking about that and
discussing it.  Otherwise, I'll just do my own thing again and probably
end up with something that fits my own needs, but not anyone else's. 
Really though, multisig shouldn't require all the same app to work.
