As you're Mac specific you could just use a modified Sparkle or something
like that. Even if you want to use a stock Sparkle, I have some code that
does threshold RSA. My intention was to use it for the Android wallet but I
never found the time. I can send you a copy if you want. But it's easier
and more robust to modify the update framework. Threshold RSA would only be
interesting if you wanted to use the Mac app store, for example.
