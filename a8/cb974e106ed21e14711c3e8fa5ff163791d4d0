Hi Simon

The poll is intended for regular Bitcoin Core contributors, who meet
once a week to discuss what they're working on. It is a mundane
software meeting, unrelated to the research and discussion of Bitcoin
itself. The meetings are open to all, but it makes sense to constrain
scheduling decisions to the current active contributors. If you'd like
to attend but are unable, meeting transcripts are always made
available online afterwards.

Please see the Contributing doc [0] if you're interested in becoming a
regular contributor to Bitcoin Core :)

Regards,
Cory
