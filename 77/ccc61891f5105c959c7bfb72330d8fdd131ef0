FWIW, Gavin's IRC response more or less amounts to being unwilling to merge 
this even though it was ready, tested, and even fulfilled his original request 
for community support for the new JSON-RPC call, all long before he announced 
the feature freeze on 0.5... hopefully it'll get merged to 0.6 git before it 
needs a rebase. :/
