Most of the problem with block propagation lies in implementation, not 
protocol... Distributing missing transaction on an as-needed basis is a 
possible improvement at the protocol level, but there hasn't (AFAIK) been any 
research into whether the little benefit outweighs the cost yet. In any case, 
I don't see why 6 new messages are needed instead of simply adding a single 
new type to getinv?
