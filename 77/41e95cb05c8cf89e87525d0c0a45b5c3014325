Shadow uses virtual time, entirely decoupled from real time. So while it
may slow down your machine, this would not affect the stats collected

(although it does make shadow somewhat unpleasant to run, unless you have a
fast machine,  compared to abstract simulators that avoid running the
actual Bitcoin code).
Hi Byron,

I've been using shadow a bit-- I think these simulators are important for
testing, but Shadow, at least, certainly seems to have limitations, in some
crucial respects.  Running shadow w Tor (which is only logical, because
many BCT transactions transpire over Tor) is not as 'light' as presented
and slows my own box down quite a bit, so the stats can't possibly be
accurate... I don't know if this answers any questions or if you've had
this experience at all -- perhaps it is negligible on a more powerful
machine than my own-- or perhaps there is an adjustment still unaccounted?

Regards,
Nina K

Hi all, is anyone using simulators like Shadow (https://shadow.github.io),
BTCSim (https://github.com/btcsuite/btcsim), etc. to test proposed changes
to Bitcoin?  I have a few questions about their capabilities and
limitations.
