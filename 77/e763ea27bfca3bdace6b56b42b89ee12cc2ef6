Not sure to get how you are answering the question

>  If the original blockchain hard-forks to re-adjust the difficulty,
then it will just represent an alt-coin having 5% of Bitcoin community,
and it can't affect Bitcoin (the segwit2mb fork).

destroys the whole thing

Because if the nodes don't upgrade and just implement the patch to
adjust the difficulty, what happens? You get a 95% mining power chain
with "no" nodes and a 5% one with "all" the nodes

I really don't get in all those discussions why the nodes are always
disconsidered compared to the miners, ie why they seem to be of zero
importance and are supposed to obey whatever you ask them

And apparently the trend is not going to revert if we look at the
priority features sent in the asicboost thread where motivating and
scaling full nodes is still something you need very powerful glasses to
see coming
