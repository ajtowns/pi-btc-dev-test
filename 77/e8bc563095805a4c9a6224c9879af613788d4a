I'm sorry, I really don't want to sound like a jerk, but not a single word
of that mattered. Yes we all want Bitcoin to scale such that every person
in the world can use it without difficulty. However if that were all that
we cared about then I would be remiss if I did not point out that there are
plenty of better, faster, and cheaper solutions to finding global consensus
over a payment ledger than Bitcoin. Architectures which are algorithmically
superior in their scaling properties. Indeed they are already implemented
and you can use them today:

https://www.stellar.org/
http://opentransactions.org/

So why do I work on Bitcoin, and why do I care about the outcome of this
debate? Because Bitcoin offers one thing, and one thing only which
alternative architectures fundamentally lack: policy neutrality. It can't
be censored, it can't be shut down, and the rules cannot change from
underneath you. *That* is what Bitcoin offers that can't be replicated at
higher scale with a SQL database and an audit log.

It follows then, that if we make a decision now which destroys that
property, which makes it possible to censor bitcoin, to deny service, or to
pressure miners into changing rules contrary to user interests, then
Bitcoin is no longer interesting. We might as well get rid of mining at
that point and make Bitcoin look like Stellar or Open-Transactions because
at least then we'd scale even better and not be pumping millions of tons of
CO2 into the atmosphere from running all those ASICs.

Neither one of those assertions is clear. Keep in mind the goal is to have
Bitcoin survive active censorship. Presumably that means being able to run
a node even in the face of a hostile ISP or government. Furthermore, it
means being location independent and being able to move around. In many
places the higher the bandwidth requirements the fewer the number of ISPs
that are available to service you, and the more visible you are.

It may also be necessary to be able to run over Tor. And not just today's
Tor which is developed, serviced, and supported by the US government, but a
Tor or I2P that future governments have turned hostile towards and actively
censor or repress. Or existing authoritative governments, for that matter.
How much bandwidth would be available through those connections?

It may hopefully never be necessary to operate under such constraints,
except by freedom seeking individuals within existing totalitarian regimes.
However the credible threat of doing so may be what keeps Bitcoin from
being repressed in the first place. Lose the capability to go underground,
and it will be pressured into regulation, eventually.

To the second point, it has been previously pointed out that large miners
stand to gain from larger blocks, for the same basic underlying reasons as
selfish mining. The incentive is to increase blocks, and miners are able to
do so at will and without cost. I would not be so certain that we wouldn't
see large blocks sooner than that.

This is basically already deployed thanks to Matt's relay network. Further
improvements are not going to have dramatic effects.

No, it doesn't. And 8GB/block is ludicrously large -- it would absolutely,
without any doubt destroy the very nature of Bitcoin, turning it into a
fundamentally uninteresting reincarnation of the existing financial system.
And still be unable to compete with VISA/Mastercard.

So why then the pressure to go down a route that WILL lead to failure by
your own metrics?

I humbly suggest that maybe we should play the strengths of Bitcoin instead
-- it's trustlessness via policy neutrality.

Either that, or go work on Stellar. Because that's where it's headed
otherwise.
