The ones that *could* pay non-mining full nodes are miners/pools, by
outsourcing transaction selection using a different PoW.  By doing so
they could buy proof-of-uncensored-selection and proof-of-goodwill for a
small fee.
We would allow full nodes to generate and broadcast a template
block which:
* Does not contain a valid header yet
* Contains the transaction selection
* Contains a  coinbase output with a predetermined part of the block
  reward (say 0.5%) to themselves* Contains a nonce for PoW of a predetermined currently ASIC resistant
  hash function behind a OP_RETURN.
The template with the highest PoW since the last block would be leading.
A miner/pool can then choose to use this instead of their own, adding
the rest of the reward and the SHA nonce themselves. That way they would
set up a competition among full nodes.
This would of course be voluntary but provable, so maybe in a pool's
interest to do this via naming and shaming.
