In some (most?) countries, it is illegal to offer telecoms services without
wiretap facilities. Does that mean Tor builds into its software "open source"
"open standards" wiretapping functionality? No. And interestingly, people
trying to add support for that stuff is actually a thing that keeps happening
in the Tor community...

In any case, I'd strongly argue that we remove BIP75 from the bips repository,
and boycott wallets that implement it. It's bad strategy for Bitcoin developers
to willingly participate in AML/KYC, just the same way as it's bad for Tor to
add wiretapping functionality, and W3C to support DRM tech. The minor tactical
wins you'll get our of this aren't worth it.
