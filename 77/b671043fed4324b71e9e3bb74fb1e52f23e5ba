You are assuming here that you can identify which transactions are spam, and 
which are not, and then segregate the spam into a separate channels of 
transactions for inclusion on a 50/50 basis alongside other transactions. 
There is no guarantee you will be able to identify those transactions. 
Sure, if you can do that, then the easy fix is just to put them into a lower 
class channel of transactions that guarantee no pressure on the non-spam 
transactions.  But it's just not possible to do this in any meaningful way. 
If you wanted to try, it would certainly add quite a bit of cost and 
complexity on the miner's side, and you aren't going to get anything other 
than the simple spam that comes from the same set of addresses.

You need to account for the transactions coming from real users.  Every real 
transaction is approximately one less spam transaction you need to fill the 
blocks.

Real hardware does not have an infinite amount of RAM.  Memory pool sizes 
cannot grow unbounded.  Some transactions with insufficient fees do get 
dropped today after many hours.

limit

Please correct me if I'm wrong (hopefully understood it). I don't think 
normal users would need to pay a higher fee - as miners can just ignore the 
spam (since they will all be linked).

If I were to spam a lot of transactions to fill the memory pool it would 
cost $120 every 10 minutes (assuming 4,000 tx can fit inside a block and 3 
cents per transaction), anything exceeding that may be considered "spam" - 
although I don't know if it would be "free" as the miner will eventually 
claim all the fees, delayed payment is probably a better way to describe it. 
IIRC, there is no memory pool cap currently. To spam 1 million transactions 
would cost $30k which would take up approx 250 blocks (around 250mb) which 
is around 42 hours to process. I think the memory pool can handle this data 
today (someone more knowledgeable can check this for me) - so the attack is 
v.expensive to carry out.

A good way to prevent this spamming the memory pool is to only accept up to 
a 'x' length of 0-confirmed transactions to make it more difficult to pull 
off (not impossible).

If I were a miner under this attack, I would just use the spam to fill up 
blocks alongside normal transactions maximising my profit.
