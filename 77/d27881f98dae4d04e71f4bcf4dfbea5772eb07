Alan's UTxO meta-chain proposal becomes vastly easier to do now that
ultraprune is merged. That would allow the Satoshi client to know it's
wallet balance and operate with a >=SPV level of security during the
initial block download, and keep them on the path of becoming a full node.
If users can see their balances, send and receive transactions, and
otherwise go about their business (except for mining) during the initial
block download, would that not address your concerns?

IMHO the only time bitcoin.org should recommend a SPV-only client is when
it is dynamically when it is being accessed from a mobile device, but
that's a separate issue.
