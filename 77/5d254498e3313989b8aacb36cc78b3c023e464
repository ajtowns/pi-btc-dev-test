I am in support of having multiple PoW forks to choose from, but it is
indeed problematic to have one chain running a rotation of algorithms.

The reason I support multiple algos is because we don't want an attacker
secretly making asics ahead of time in the event of an emergency PoW fork.
We want them to be uncertain which of a large selection of algorithms are
going to be used, making pre-emptive asic manufacturing more difficult.

But once an algorithm is chosen that should be the end of the story, just
one algo without rotation.
