Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Introducing BitcoinKit.framework
Message-ID: <B87F1213-5BD8-43F5-9744-F69947561ED5@grabhive.com>

Hi devs,

Just wanted to cross-post this here since it seems very relevant.

We're launching BitcoinKit.framework, a Cocoa framework that allows developers to write Bitcoin wallet apps for Mac OS X. BitcoinKit uses bitcoind, and serves a small and tidy API for developer use. Support for other Bitcoin implementations (libcbitcoin, etc) is soon to follow.

BitcoinKit's first application is as the backbone of a new Mac wallet app called Hive, which will be released soon at www.grabhive.com.

Grab the source here:
https://github.com/grabhive/BitcoinKit

Support is available via GitHub issues and this Bitcointalk thread:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=256583.msg2733523

A sample GUI app is also included:

Cheers everyone!
