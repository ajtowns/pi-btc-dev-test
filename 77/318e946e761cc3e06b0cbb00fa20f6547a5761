Hi there,
   For users who don?t wish a service provider to be able to see their
information, even ephemerally, and they would like to exchange information
via BIP75, they can use a software wallet, such as a breadwallet or others,
and that data will only exist on their phone, and the phone of their
counterparty (assuming the counterparty also chose to exchange info, and
was running on a software wallet).

In this way, we allow users to exchange data as they choose, without having
the risk that a service provider be asked for that data.

If a user chooses to use a hosted platform, and also to store their
identity data there, I do agree it could be subject to a subpoena, the same
as when they host their email, and other services.

Finally, they could choose not to use BIP75 at all, and no one would know
whether they did or didn?t (other than their counterparts) as we don?t
leave any residue on the blockchain, or anywhere else in the public eye.

We believe that this solution, due in part to its narrow data aperture, is
the best solution available to the problem we are solving.  We are eager to
engage in any discussions about how to improve the proposed solution, with
an eye to fungibility, privacy, and usability.

That said, there is a real need for people to know who they are transacting
with for usability reasons, for fraud reduction, and also of regulatory
reasons for some players.  To NOT solve it with a carefully crafted
standard means that it is more likely to be solved with back room, quick
and dirty solutions that are not available for community review and
feedback.

Thanks!

Justin
