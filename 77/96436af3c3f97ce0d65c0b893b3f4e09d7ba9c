In one sense it already is decided? there is a protocol rule
implementing a hard maximum, and soft rules for lower targets.  If
it's to be changed it would only be by it being obvious to almost
everyone that it should _and_ must be.  Since, in the long run,
Bitcoin can't meet its security and decenteralization promises without
blockspace scarcity to drive non-trivial fees and without scaling
limits to keep it decenteralized? it's not a change that could be made
more lightly than changing the supply of coin.

I hope that should it become necessary to do so that correct path will
be obvious to everyone, otherwise there is a grave risk of undermining
the justification for the confidence in the immutability of any of the
rules of the system.
