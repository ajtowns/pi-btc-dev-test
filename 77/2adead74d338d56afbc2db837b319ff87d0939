Please at least get Coinbaser merged for 0.5. It has had a lot of testing on 
Eligius for months, a landslide of support for the new JSON-RPC method (as 
requested), and I have even gone to the effort to document it. As I will no 
longer be using bitcoind for Eligius soon, I have little incentive to 
maintain/rebase coinbaser across a 0.6 development period.
