>>>Take a quick look at the COOP proposal...it gets us to 4mb blocks in 4
years....gradually, no massive fee swings.<<<

How is that captured in the COOP BIP? I can see Luke's 2MB cap referenced
in the BIP, but I don't see anything in the text that would indicate a
gradual increase of any sort.

As someone who has previously written a BIP draft to accomplish a gradual
increase with SegWit, I'd be very interested in seeing what approach
they've chosen.
