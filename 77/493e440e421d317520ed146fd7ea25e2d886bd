Wladimir noted that 'The original presented intention of block size
increase was a one-time "scaling" to grant time for more decentralizing
solutions to develop'

Comments?

In particular, if bandwidth scaling doesn't go according to your plan,
e.g. the exponential exponent is too large, perhaps due to technological
growth not keeping pace, or the political realities of actual bandwidth
deployment making theoretical technological growth irrelevant, what
mechanism will prevent centralization? (if any)
