Yes! Good point, network should be encoded. Not sure I like this format yet, but what if it was part of the authority, like block:testnet. Like http uses port 80 by default, you could have block by default refer to block:mainnet.

Eg.
blockchain://tx:testnet3/3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a

I will read the RFC over more thoroughly tomorrow to get an idea of what types of things make more or less sense.

>> Specification
>> =============
>> The URI follow this simple form:

>> blockchain: <hash/string>
>> 
>> Examples:
>> 
>> blockchain:00000000000000001003e880d500968d51157f210c632e08a652af3576600198
