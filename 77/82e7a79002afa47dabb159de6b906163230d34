I've tried to cover all that I've heard about in my blog posts about why I
think the risks of 20MB blocks are outweighed by the benefits, am I missing
something?
  (blog posts are linked from
http://gavinandresen.ninja/time-to-roll-out-bigger-blocks )

There is the "a sudden jump to a 20MB max might have unforseen
consequences" risk that I don't address, but a dynamic increase would fix
that.
