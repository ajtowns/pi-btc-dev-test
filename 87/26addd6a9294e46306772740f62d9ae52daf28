There's hardly any cases where "thousands of confirmations" change anything.

Anyway, SPV is a discredited concept and we shouldn't be concerning ourselves
with it.

Indeed it does: between the number of txouts, scriptSig length, scriptPubKey
length, and the upper bits of nValue we have ~32 known bits that we can use to
distinguish between inner nodes and transactions. That's a false positive rate
of under one in a billion, so no issues there.
