I tend to agree with slush here - counting the IPs in addr broadcasts often
gives a number like 100,000 vs just 10,000 for actually reachable nodes (or
less). It seems like optimising the NAT tunneling code would help. Starting
by adding more diagnostic stuff to the GUI. STUN support may also help.

The main constraint with home devices is not IMHO their actual power but
rather that a lot of people no longer keep computers switched on all the
time. If you don't do that then spv with bundled Core can't help your
security because the spv wallet would always be syncing from the p2p
network for performance reasons.
