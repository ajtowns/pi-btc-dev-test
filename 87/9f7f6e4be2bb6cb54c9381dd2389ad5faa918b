Re-reading this, I think what you mean is it should be possible to
create a proof for (a) specific UTXO(s), hence "inputs". That sounds
pretty useful, yeah!

So you could provide a mix of addresses and inputs (as txid:vout) and
it would generate a proof that signs the message for each input
(taking scriptPubKey from address or from the UTXO data directly on
the blockchain).
