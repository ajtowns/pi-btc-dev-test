If the order of the tokens is fixed, the tokens themselves are redundant
information when tokens are required; when tokens may be omitted, a simple
"Some/None" flag to mark whether or not the optional data has been omitted is
appropriate.


Also, if you're going to break compatibility with all existing software, it
makes sense to use a format that extends the merkle tree down into the
transaction inputs and outputs.
