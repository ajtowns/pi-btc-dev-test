Please don't assume poor intentions or sneaky motives.  I get a lot of
emails from a lot of people about a lot of things.  Nine months ago was
an eternity in this world, and it can't be ruled out that I simply forgot.

I have no problem giving credit where it is due, and I mentioned in my
first email that I wasn't sure if my stuff was original.  Please
recap/link it here so that it can be part of this discussion.
