Because namcoin tries to solve a different problem, DNS, whereas I want
to establish an identity for a payment protocol. Your incoming payments
will land on addresses that are derived (regardless which way) from this
idenity. This makes your identity as important (securitywise) as
anything else involved in the bitcoin protocol. Therefore I would not
want to have payment-ids rely on anything _less_ than bitcoin's own
blockchain. In particular not on PKI with centralized root CAs. But also
not on namecoin or any other (weaker) alt-chains.

You can argue that alt-chains _can_ be as strong as bitcoin, but they
don't _have to_ be. There is no guarantee how many people will
cross-mine. The alt-chain could even disappear at some point. If at some
point your alt-chain is no longer being worked on, then how do you prove
that some old bitcoin transaction went to an address for which there was
a valid id/certificate at the time of sending? If the certificate is
based inside bitcoin's blockchain then you will have a proof for the
correct destinations of all your old transactions as long as bitcoin
exists.

Besides all this, as you mentioned namecoin specifically, that is
overkill if you just want to link two hashes together. A single 2-of-2
multisig output would suffice for that.

You are probably right that storing this in the _spent outputs_ would be
better. There doesn't seem to be any type of client out there that would
benefit from having to search UTXO only.
