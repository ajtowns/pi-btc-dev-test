Can anyone opposed to this proposal articulate in plain english the worst
case scenario(s) if it goes ahead?

Some people in the conversation appear to be uncomfortable, perturbed,
defensive etc about the proposal ?. But I am not seeing specifics on why it
is not a feasible plan.

I have explained why I believe there is some urgency, whereby "some urgency"
I mean, assuming it takes months to implement, merge, test, release and for
people to upgrade.

But if it makes you happy, imagine that this discussion happens all over
again next year and I ask the same question.
