Hard-forks aren't hard for directly political issues, they're politically hard because they're risky by requiring everyone yo upgrade at once. In the case of signature validation, that touches a *lot* of third party code that people rely on to avoid being defrauded.

FWIW I've actually got a half-finished writeup for how to use OP_CODESEPARATOR and a CHECKSIG2 soft-fork to have signatures sign fees and so forth.
