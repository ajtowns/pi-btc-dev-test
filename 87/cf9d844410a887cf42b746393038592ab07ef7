RE "doesn't buy you anything"   Today, when unlocked, plaintext
private keys reside in the same address space as the blockchain engine
(BCE).  Process separation increases the difficulty of accessing key
data from the BCE, even presuming a normal, no-chroot, same-uid,
parent-child process relationship.  The attack surface is clearly
changed from "one buffer overflow can touch this data."

Regardless, the split makes sense given existing modularity and coding
directions.  I wouldn't micro-focus on the "sandbox" word.
