I don't think all BIPs lend themselves to this pattern. Can you think of another example? I also suspect each ignored flag requires carefully defined behavior, so it's probably better to spell that out in the BIP.

I also wouldn't be surprised if this BIP will get superseded in its entirety in the not too distant future; I believe there's some earlier discussion on this list about variations on BIP-71. So I don't think there will be many additional params in the future that warrant abstraction.

Most wallets consider bech32 addresses to be invalid. This would allow merchants to display a backwards compatible P2SH address and allow modern wallets to use bech32. In fact, this should be encouraged because it's slightly cheaper for the recipient to spend these funds (but not worth even a tiny increase in shopping cart abandonment).

Once the new format has sufficient adoption, merchants can simply drop support for old wallets and not use this parameter.
