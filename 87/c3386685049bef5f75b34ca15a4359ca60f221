This is maybe the best idea. I added it:
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0015#IP_Transactions

Things I like about this:
- IP transactions are useful, but have a security flaw. This mitigates their security problems.
- The code for IP transactions is already in Satoshi client. If other clients want to add IP transactions, then it can be done with minimal fuss/bloat.
I feel that for any protocol extension, less is more. The less code 
needed, the better the extension. Not always but generally we want to 
avoid bitcoin protocol bloat which *will* happen far in the future. The 
only way to mitigate how spaghettified the standard will be in the 
future, is by careful cautious planning now.

- We can have a proxy node running 24/7 for us, serving our public keys in lieu of us.

Bitcoin already has code and a protocol for transactions to IP
addresses. Why not reuse that for dynamic address lookup? Just a few
changes are necessary to enable complete user at server.com handling:
- Extend the protocol so that "reply" messages can be signed by a fixed
? public key
- Extend "checkorder" messages so they can specify an account to
? send BTC to. Or standardize on how to put the account into the
? message field.
- Enable DNS lookups for IP transactions. The DNS-only proposals could
? also be used here to avoid having to use the IP transaction protocol
? sometimes. The public key for signing "reply" messages can be gotten
? from TXT records. This will be safe with DNSSEC and Namecoin. With
? plain DNS Bitcoin could take a SSH-like approach and ask the user to
? verify the public key the first time it is used, remembering it later.

DoS attacks are already handled by the IP transactions code: the same IP
address is always given the same bitcoin address until it pays to that
bitcoin address.
