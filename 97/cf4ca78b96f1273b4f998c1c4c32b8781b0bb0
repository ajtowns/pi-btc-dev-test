Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Idea: More decimal places for lower minimum fee
Message-ID: <f3683e4eb1b51d75476564a5b4f51651@posteo.de>

Currently, the minimum fee of 1 satoshi per byte corresponds to about 
0.09 USD per kB, which is no longer insignificant. Maybe the time has 
come now to introduce more decimal places and make the minimum fee 1 of 
the new smallest unit. This way, everyday payments would again be 
possible with virtually no fee without flooding the mempool with free 
spam transactions.
