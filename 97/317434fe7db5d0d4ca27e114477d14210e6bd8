Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Multisig with hashes instead of pubkeys
Message-ID: <CAL8tG=n6NnTaeV71-sWi3Bvk_8E8F20_69f90k-Shrc4XXUQog@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Is there a worked out scriptPubKey for doing multisig with just hashes
of the participants? I think it is doable and it is more secure to a
compromised ECDSA. I'm thinking something like this for the
scriptPubKey:
 2 OP_SWAP OP_SWAP OP_SWAP OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash1>
OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash2> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_DUP
OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash3> OP_EQUALVERIFY 3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG

and <sigs><pubkeys> for the scriptSig

Can anyone confirm or send me a link to the worked out script?

Thanks
