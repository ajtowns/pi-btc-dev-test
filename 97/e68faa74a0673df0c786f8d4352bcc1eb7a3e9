Script versions makes this no longer a hard-fork to do. The script version would implicitly encode which jets are optimized, and what their optimized cost is.

AFAIU, other similar systems are left doing hard-forks to reduce the sigops/weight/fee-cost of transactions every time they want to add useful optimized drop-ins. For obvious reasons, this seems rather impractical and a potentially critical barrier to adoption of such optimized drop-ins, which I imagine would be required to do any new cryptographic algorithms due to the significant fee cost of interpreting such things.

I've used Simplicity's formal semantics to prove correct an implementation of the SHA-256 compression function written in Simplicity.  I have also implemented a variant of ECDSA signature verification in Simplicity, and plan to formally validate its correctness along with the associated elliptic curve operations.

This is important for both node operators, so that the costs are knows before evaluation, and for designing Simplicity programs, so that smart-contract participants can know the costs of their contract before committing to it.

I anticipate developing a broad set of useful jets covering arithmetic operations, elliptic curve operations, and cryptographic operations including hashing and digital signature validation.

Only after extensive vetting would it be suitable to consider Simplicity for inclusion in Bitcoin.
