Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP39 (mnemonic seeds) Unicode normalization
	compatibility issue
Message-ID: <CABWuLVf6zUhyTSDkXv26WqUE43q7PHqtOtfm5SNs_LkbmGt9dQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on a replacement for BIP39 and noticed that the password
section mandates a Unicode normalization pass but does not prohibit
unassigned character points.

I believe that this is problematic as newer drafts of Unicode alter the
output of normalization passes.  So if a user assigned a password using a
wallet that linked to Unicode 9 but input a code point reserved in Unicode
10, updating the wallet to Unicode 10 could incorrectly remap that code
point [0].

Thank you,
-Zach Lym

P.S. The relevant RFC on this subject specifies a different normalization
procedure [1]
