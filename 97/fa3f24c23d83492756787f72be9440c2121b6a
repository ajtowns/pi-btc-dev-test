I covered the security considerations unique to hard-forks on my blog:

How do we know any of this testing is actually being performed? I don't
currently know of any concrete testing actually done.

Are you unaware of Not Bitcoin XT?

See above.

Also, as the two coins are separate currencies and can easily trade
against each other in a 75%/25% split, it would be easy for the price to
diverge and hashing power to move.

In fact, I've been asked multiple times now by exchanges and other
players in this ecosystem for technical advice on how to split coins
across the chains effectively (easily done with nLockTime). Notably, the
exchanges who have asked me this - who hold customer funds on their
behalf - have informed me that their legal advice was that the
post-hard-fork coins are legally speaking separate currencies, and
customers must be given the opportunity to transact in them separately
if they choose too.  Obviously, with a 75%/25% split, while block times
on the other chain will be slower, the chain is still quite useful and
nearly as secure as the main chain against 51% attack; why I personally
have suggested a 99% threshold:

http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-January/012309.html

(remember that the threshold can always be soft-forked down)

It's also notable that millions of dollars of Bitcoin are voting agsast
the fork on the proof-of-stake voting site Bitcoinocracy.com While
obviously not comprehensive, the fact that a relatively obscure site
like it can achieve participation like that, even without an easy to use
user friendly interface.

Please provide details on exactly how that's going to happen.
