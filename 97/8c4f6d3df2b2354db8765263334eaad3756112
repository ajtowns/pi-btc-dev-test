Hi,

I'll reply to myself here, just to mention that the issue is solved.

Dave Hook from Bouncycastle replied that in the particular signature 
mentioned, one of the ASN1 encoded Integers is actually negative (which 
is not a valid coordinate for a point on a curve I assume). Since ASN1 
integers are always signed, one has to pad "big" values with a zero byte 
to stay positive.

Workaround is easy for verification (convert to positive).

Robert.
