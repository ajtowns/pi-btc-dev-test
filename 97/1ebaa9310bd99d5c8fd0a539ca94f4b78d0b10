Indeed. That's the point of the blockchain, to take all those potential
inconsistencies and vote on a true transaction history to achieve
consensus.

Right now we don't have double-spend proof propagation, so the
"net-split" attack is actually totally trivial: just broadcast two
different, mutually incompatible, transactions at the same time. About
half the time the recipient will get the payment, the other half of the
time the payment they thought they were going to get is invalidated.

It's very, very rare for sites to have protection against that;
blockchain.info's shared-send mixer is one of the few exceptions. But
the have access to a whole network monitoring service with connections
to nodes all over the planet.

It's not ideal, but it still protects against after-the-fact blockchain
analysis.

Statistics is hard - you can't get it right all the time. Besides, what
happens when everyone adds a safety margin? Some people can afford to
wait, so for them starting at a low bid and raises it makes a lot of
sense.

Think about that problem a bit harder. :)
