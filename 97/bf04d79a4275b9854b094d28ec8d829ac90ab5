One of the things going for us here is that Bitmain has been keeping ASICBOOST
from their own customers - as far as we know they haven't been sharing it, and
thus they're the only ones you can actually use it.

So while we're pissing off Bitmain in disabling it, we wouldn't be affecting
anyone else.

Equally, mining is a zero-sum game: if no-one can use ASICBOOST, miners are in
the same position as before. ASICBOOST is only relevant to miners like Bitmain
who have access to it while other miners don't.
