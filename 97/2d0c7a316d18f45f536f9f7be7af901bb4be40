It's good that the core devs keep doing good work on these topics, thanks.

I don't hear anyone lying.

Actually, it is, and comparatively speaking, Bitcoin is better than the
most common alternatives in use by people around the world.  There are
obvious issues (dust, how to handle fee issues moving forward, one could
blather on forever about that), but again, I think core devs have done
fairly well and will probably continue to do so along with many others. 
That's just my own 0.00004 BTC though (my way of saying, at time of
posting this, "my own 2 cents").

That was not very specific.  Could you be more specific?
