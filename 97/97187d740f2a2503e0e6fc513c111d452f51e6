In most regions it's not only 'simple' but trivial - BTC is just 
'another currency' and accounted for exactly the same way - it doens't 
matter if you sell your hose for GBP, USD, EUR, BTC or sacks of Pig 
Dung, you still have a GBP tax issue ...

You want to volunteer to pay tax ? I'd suggest stronger medication ...

80% of 'donations' end up spent on 'adminsitration' and not what they 
were donated for, this is a 'greed' issue not a 'currency' issue.

Tax isn't voluntary or a donation. The 18% who think UK tax is well 
spent are the 18% of the population who get the tax money, not the 82% 
that pay it ;)

First we kill all the politicians ...

So give it to the FD - what you do with your post-tax profits are up to 
you ;)

Where does gov't come into this ? I think you're confusing 'tax' which 
you have zero control over and 'donations' which you already have 100% 
control over.
