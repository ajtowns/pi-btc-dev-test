While I fully agree with the intent (increasing full nodes so a big
miner waking up in a bad mood can't threaten the world any longer every
day as it is now) I am not sure to get the interest of this proposal,
because:

- it's probably not a good idea to encourage the home users to run full
nodes, there are many people running servers far from their capacity
that could easily run efficient full nodes

- if someone can't allocate 100 GB today to run a full node, then we
can't expect him to allocate more in the future

- the download time is a real concern

- this proposal is a kind of reinventing torrents, while limiting the
number of connections to something not efficient at all, I don't see why
something that is proven to be super efficient (torrents) would be
needed to be reinvented, I am not saying that it should be used as the
bittorrent network is doing but the concepts can be reused

- I don't get at all the concept of "archival" nodes since it's another
useless step toward centralization

I think the only way to increase full nodes it to design an incentive
for people to run them

> 256 pieces would incur a nontrivial amount of hashing (post segwit, as
> much as 100MB of extra hashing per block), and would require an
> additional ~4kb of storage per block. The hashing overhead here may be
> prohibitive.
