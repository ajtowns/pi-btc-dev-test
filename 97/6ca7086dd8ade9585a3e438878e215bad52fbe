Jeff's arguments are understood and supported by those who worked in finance.

Existing financial applications have often problems dealing with more than 2 decimals.
People who work in finance are used to two decimals.

Neither systems nor people in finance have a problem with large numbers though.

For above practical reasons I am also for moving to a unit that equals 100 satoshi.
I heard the name bit for it which I like.
