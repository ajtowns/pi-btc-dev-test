My views on censorship resistance in the face of scaling:

1) I expect if I'm not careful about preserving my privacy with the way I
use Bitcoin, then I will always run the risk of being censored by miners.
This means connecting to the network anonymously, not reusing addresses,
and perhaps even mixing my coins.  The onus is on me here to avoid
censorship, but I'm optimistic that this privacy preservation can be made
pretty automatic.

2) I expect anonymity systems to scale to accommodate Bitcoin full nodes,
not Bitcoin to stay small to avoid putting pressure on anonymity systems to
scale.

3) If 2 is too tall an order, then mining in a pool is always an option.
There should always be some countries in the world free enough to allow
mining pools to operate, and miners in countries that ban Bitcoin can
simply connect to these anonymously.  If not, then Bitcoin is toast anyway,
is it not?  If these miners are really interested in avoiding censoring
transactions, then they will do their due diligence and choose a pool that
doesn't do this.  But even if they don't, censorship can be personally
avoided by following 1.
