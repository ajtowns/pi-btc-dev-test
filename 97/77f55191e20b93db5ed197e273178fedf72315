Everyone here is excited about the potential of Bitcoin and would
aspirationally like it to reach its full potential as fast as
possible.  But the block-size is not a free variable, half those
parameters you listed are in conflict with each other.  We're trying
to improve both decentralisation and throughput short-term while
people work on algorithmic improvements mid-term.  If you are
interested you can take a look through the proposals:

http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/008603.html

Note that probably 99% of Bitcoin transactions already happen
off-chain in exchanges, tipping services, hosted wallets etc.  Maybe
you're already using them, assuming you are a bitcoin user.
They constitute an early stage layer 2, some of them even have on
chain netting and scale faster than the block-chain.

You can also read about layer 2, the lightning network paper and the
duplex micropayment channel paper:

and read the development list and look at the code:
