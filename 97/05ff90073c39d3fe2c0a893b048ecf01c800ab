Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Version bits proposal
Message-ID: <CAPg+sBg5TqQ=zjyZ7dp-d1oBGp31Krnix3zyt9suP4-AGbxW=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

here is a proposal for how to coordinate future soft-forking consensus
changes: https://gist.github.com/sipa/bf69659f43e763540550

It supports multiple parallel changes, as well as changes that get
permanently rejected without obstructing the rollout of others.

Feel free to comment. As the gist does not support notifying participants
of new comments, I would suggest using the mailing list instead.

This is joint work with Peter Todd and Greg Maxwell.
