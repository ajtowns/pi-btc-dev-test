In Drivechain, 51% of miners have total control and ownership over all of the sidechain coins. The vision of Drivechain is to have many blockchains "plugged in" to the main chain.

Today, well over 51% of miners are under the jurisdiction of a single government.

Thus the effect of Drivechain appears to be the creation of a new kind of digital border imposed onto the network where everyone hands over ownership of their Bitcoins to a /single/ mining cartel when they wish to interact with /any/ sidechain.

Drivechain would be a reasonable idea if that weren't the case, but since it is, Drivechain now introduces a very real possible future where Bitcoins can be confiscated by the Chinese government in exactly the same manner that the Chinese government today confiscates financial assets in other financial networks within China.

One argument is that the psuedo-anonymity granted by Bitcoin addresses could theoretically make this less likely to happen, and while that is true, it is also true that every day Bitcoin becomes less and less psuedo-anonymous as governments invest in blockchain analysis tech [1].

How many high-profile confiscations ? now via the Bitcoin-blockchain itself (no longer being able to blame a 3rd-party exchange) ? is Bitcoin willing to tolerate and open itself up to?

In a world before Drivechain: the worst that a 51% coalition can do is prevent you from spending your coins (censorship).

In a world with Drivechain three things become true:

1. The Bitcoin network centralizes more, because more power (both financial power and power in terms of capability/control) is granted to miners. This is likely to have secondary consequences on the main-chain network as well (in terms of its price and ability to evolve).

2. A 51% coalition ? and/or the government behind it ? is now able to financially profit by confiscating coins. No longer is it just censorship, "asset forfeiture" ? theft ? becomes a real possibility for day-to-day Bitcoin users.

3. Drivechain limits user's existing choice when it comes to who is acting as custodian of their Bitcoins, from any trustworthy exchange, down to a single mining cartel under the control of a single set of laws.

The argument given to this is that a UASF could be initiated to wrest control away from this cartel. I do not believe this addresses the concern at all.

A UASF is a very big deal and extremely difficult to pull off correctly. Even when you have users behind you, it *requires* significant support from the miners themselves [2]. Therefore, I do not believe a UASF is a realistic possibility for recovery.

I would only support Drivechain if all of these issue were addressed.

Kind regards,
Greg Slepak
