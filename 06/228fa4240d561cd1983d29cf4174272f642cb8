Mike,

To sum it up, you are saying "bitcoin will break and many of our users
will leave therefore OMG WTF so we have to do what GAVIN AND ME want
to do to hardfork to XT which is the ONLY WAY, so GTFO!"

And so, no.  We don't have to accept that attitude.

There are other proposals that actually would work here.

Cameron Garnham's dynamic block size adjustment (needing soft fork
only) mentioned here http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1smkanp

Jeff Garzik's proposals (rewritten and published as a BIP)
http://bitcoin-development.narkive.com/f5FMeA4D/comments-on-bip-100

and more.

I also disagree with the notion that everybody's just ok with what
Mike and Gavin are doing.... specifically, this statement by Mike

> The consensus you seek does exist. All wallet developers (except 
> Lawrence), all the major exchanges, all the major payment
> processors and many of the major mining pools want to see the limit
> lifted

was kind of twisting things, because it made it sound like everybody
supports Gavin's proposal to hard fork to XT, which these folks don't.

Example:

1)
http://cointelegraph.com/news/114481/chinese-exchanges-reject-gavin-andr
esens-20-mb-block-size-increase

2) https://twitter.com/GreenAddress/status/605037073725313024

This isn't to say they don't want to see a limit adjusted but not in
the way that Gavin (and you, Mike) are proposing - not through this
hard fork to XT.

So go roll out your code for whatever it is you are going to put into
XT and make a BIP, but stop saying that everyone supports it when
obviously they don't and you don't even have something yet and there
are already superior alternatives that don't involve Gavin's hard fork
and your blessed XT.
