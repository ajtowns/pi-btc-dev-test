Thank you. We hadn't seen that before.  It is an interesting discussion.

We did think about including some references to protections for private
keys while they remained in your control and you could prove as much. In
theory it should be no different to dropping money on the floor. The money
still belongs to you, even if someone else comes along and finds it. The
onus of proof is on you as the owner to demonstrate private keys are yours,
but you also need the goodwill of the person finding the money.

However, this raised a number of issues including whether finding private
keys attached to coins and moving the funds constituted theft, in which
case there are already criminal protections if you are able to track the
coins to an individual. We decided not to include anything specific in the
draft licence to keep it simple, relying instead on the generic definitions
of rights to *private transaction data* of which private keys would come
under.

Regards,

Ahmed
