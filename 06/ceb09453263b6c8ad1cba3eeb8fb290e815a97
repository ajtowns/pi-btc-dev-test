This is true -- though there is value to having a list of "things we
think people should focus on" for the motivated, and for new people
interested in tackling a project, but not sure what project to tackle.

A centrally managed development branch on bitcoin/bitcoin.git is not
the way to do it, however.  See the description of linux-next, in my
previous email, for a more distributed method which can easily be
layered on top of the existing bitcoin dev structure by any motivated
volunteer(s).

Think distributed.  :)  The community does not need Linus's help
(linux-next) or Gavin's help (bitcoin-next) to do this.  linux-next
became so widely used and useful that Linus requires almost all
changes to be first staged in linux-next.
