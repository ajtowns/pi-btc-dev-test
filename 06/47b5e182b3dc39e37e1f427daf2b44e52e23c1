1. Latency is what matters here, not bandwidth so much. And latency reduction 
is either expensive or impossible.
2. Mining pools are mostly run at a loss (with exception to only the most 
centralised pools), and have nothing to invest in increasing infrastructure.

You're overlooking at least:
1. The real network has to suffer wasted work as a result of the stale blocks, 
while an attacker does not. If 20% of blocks are stale, the attacker only 
needs 40% of the legitimate hashrate to achieve 50%-in-practice.
2. Since blocks are individually weaker, it becomes cheaper to DoS nodes with 
invalid blocks. (not sure if this is a real concern, but it ought to be 
considered and addressed)

One can probably overcome changing network conditions merely by trying to 
reach 75% and exclude the slowest 25%. Also, there is no way to identify or 
blacklist miners.

I agree this shouldn't be a real concern. SPV wallets are also more likely and 
less risky (globally) to be auto-updated.

Uh, I think you need to be using at least median speeds. As an example, I can 
only sustain (over 3G) about 40 kbps, with a peak of around 400 kbps. 3G has 
worse range/coverage than 2G. No doubt the *average* is skewed so high because 
of densely populated areas like San Francisco having 400+ Mbps cellular data. 
It's not reasonable to assume sync only at night: most payments will be during 
the day, on battery - so increased power use must also be considered.

Only in small densely populated areas of first-world countries.
