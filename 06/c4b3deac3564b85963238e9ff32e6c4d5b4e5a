Johnson,

I feel that's not as much of an issue with v0 witness programs. Segwit
isn't activated yet, and segwit-capable wallets aren't as widely
deployed for production. Not to mention, they're all going to require
further development anyway: the address serialization for witness
programs only became a BIP this week. No segwit wallets should ever be
planning to receive money to naked witness programs right now, since
addresses are for it aren't even available.

I think we have the benefit of timing here. The state of segwit wallet
development incidentally creates a window of time where this maturity
rule can be implemented.
