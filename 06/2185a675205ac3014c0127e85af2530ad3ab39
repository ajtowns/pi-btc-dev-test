Great, I'm hearing rough consensus to proceed with Pieter's plan.

RE: far from confident on malleability routes:  I'm reasonably confident
that we can squash malleability for IsStandard, SIGHASH_ALL transactions. A
proper proof of DSA signature un-malleability (or an lower bound for how
much work it would be to create a valid doppleganger signature) would be
great, but I don't think it is necessary to proceed.
