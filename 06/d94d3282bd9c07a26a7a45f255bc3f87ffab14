I have no preference for any particular project build system. If a system
* is easy enough to set up (included in standard repositories, eg.)
* allows building of the bitcoin codebase on several linux distro's
* does cross-compilation to windows
* supports osx
* is easy to maintain
* it is not too hard to adapt other GUI's to use it (bitcoin-qt,
  maybe others as well, i hear about a cocoabitcoin?)
* gets implemented and tested to support all of the above
.. i have no problem with choosing that system for future versions.
