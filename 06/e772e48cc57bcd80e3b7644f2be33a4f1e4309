Sending just the output addresses of each transaction would use about
1 kilobit/s of data. Sending the entire transactions would use
~14kbit/sec data.  These don't seem to be a unsustainable tremendous
amount of data to use while an application is running.

Doubly so for SPV wallets which are highly vulnerable to unconfirmed
transactions, and many which last I heard testing reports on became
pretty severely corrupted once given a fake transaction.

Can someone make a case why saving no more than those figures would
justify the near total loss of privacy that filtering gives?

"Because they already do it" isn't a good argument when talking about
a new protocol feature; things which already do BIP37 will presumably
continue to already do BIP37.
