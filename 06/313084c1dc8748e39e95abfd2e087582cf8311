That won't help SPV nodes, unfortunately.

We already see non-validating mining, but they do empty blocks.  This
just makes it more attractive in the future, since you can collect fees
too.

But I think it's clear we'll eventually need some UTXO commitment so
full nodes can tell SPV nodes about bad blocks.
