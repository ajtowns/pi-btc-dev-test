Or alternatively, fix the reasons why users would have negative experiences
with full blocks, chiefly:

  * Get safe forms of replace-by-fee and child-pays-for-parent finished and
in 0.12.
  * Develop cross-platform libraries for managing micropayment channels,
and get wallet authors to adopt
  * Use fidelity bonds, solvency proofs, and other tricks to minimize the
risk of already deployed off-chain solutions as an interim measure until:
  * Deploy soft-fork changes for truly scalable solutions like Lightning
Network.

Not raising the block size limit does not mean doing nothing to solve the
problem.
