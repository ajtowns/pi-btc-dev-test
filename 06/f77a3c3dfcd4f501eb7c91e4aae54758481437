Hmm. I think this is a disagreement over the term massive. I was meaning we
don't see double spending like we see carding fraud in the traditional
online payments world. We can talk about Finney attacks by linking to
specific discussions of specific events, because they are very rare, which
is why merchants generally ignore the possibility. I didn't mean the
numeric value of lost coins added up so far.
