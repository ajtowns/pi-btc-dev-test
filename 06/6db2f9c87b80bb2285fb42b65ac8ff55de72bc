The current question ? as already mentioned ? is we ACK to work together
on a signing protocol or if we NACK this before we even have started.

I'm not saying that the draft proposal I made is the way to go, I'm
happy to NACK it myself in favor of a better proposal.

I strongly recommend to work together on a standard that will have one
central winner: the end user.
