I spent some time changing the internal bitcoin code to use callback
hooks, but its far from complete (or even really usable from anything
other than the code in the satoshi client itself, it doesnt even have
any deregister methods!).  As it sits now, it is likely to get more
eyeballs and merged for 0.7.  If you need additional specific callbacks,
adding them would be cool, though I wouldn't recommend relying on the
blockstore API to remain even remotely stable for the foreseeable
future.
