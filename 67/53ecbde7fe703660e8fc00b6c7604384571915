There's no problem, but there's no benefit either. It also locks us in to a
potentially problematic guarantee - what if in future we want to have, say,
two optional new pieces of data in two different messages. We don't want to
require that if version > X then you have to implement all features up to
and including that point.

Essentially the number of fields in a message is like a little version
number, just for that message. It adds flexibility to keep it that way, and
there's no downside, seeing as that bridge was already crossed and people
with parsers that can't handle it need to fix their code anyway.

So I have a slight preference for keeping things the way they are, it keeps
things flexible for future and costs nothing.
