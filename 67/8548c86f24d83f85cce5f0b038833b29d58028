I now see how it worked with Bitcoin 0.8.6.  Lucid has qt-4.6.2.

It is more than one symbol.  It does not seem to be a wise thing to replace
functions beyond the trivial in glibc and libstdc++.

I personally think we need to decide upon a cut-off point beyond which it
makes no sense to add the risk of increased complexity.  RHEL6 had qt-4.6.2
as well and I don't think I've heard a single complaint about bitcoin-qt
being broken there given almost nobody uses it as a desktop.
