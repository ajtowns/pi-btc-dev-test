These are the types of things I have been discussing in relation to a 
process:

-A list of metrics
-A Risk analysis of the baseline system.  Bitcoin as it is now.
-Mitigation strategies for each risk.
-A set of goals.
-A Road map for each goal that lists the changes or possible avenues to 
achieve that goal.

Proposed changes would be measured against the same metrics and a risk 
analysis done so it can be compared with the baseline.

For example, the block size debate would be discussed in the context of 
a road map related to a goal of increase scaling.  One of the metrics 
would be a decentralization metric.  (A framework for a decentralization 
metric is at 
http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/stm103%20articles/Schneider_Decentralization.pdf). 
  Cost would be one aspect of the decentralization metric.
