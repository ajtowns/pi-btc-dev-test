No no no I never stated that the UI should no longer support RPC. If you
want the UI, with RPC, you can still run the UI executable with -server.
There are many usecases in which you want to access the UI bitcoin client
using RPC...

I only meant that it would also build the *headless* daemon by default, as
separate "bitcoind" executable. So you cannot run the UI exectuable as
headless server anymore. The -daemon option would go away. It would make the
setup a lot easier: The UI can connect to  X and display a splash screen
immediately without first looking at the command line arguments, whereas the
headless daemon can ignore all that stuff and get straight to work.

It's easy on windows:  just install Qt Creator (comes with the Qt SDK),
install the extra dependencies (build instructions are in README.rst), and
hit build.

On MacOSX I'm not sure.  I think it's similar, as a few people built it for
MacOSX and contributed settings for the .pro file...

It can build the GUI fine for every platform, however it can only build the
GUI, not the headless daemon or the command line client. You'd still need
old fashioned makefiles for those.

Cmake or autotools would be better, especially as those are intelligent
enough to auto-detect the name of libraries such as boost, and detect
presence of optional dependencies (miniupnp).
