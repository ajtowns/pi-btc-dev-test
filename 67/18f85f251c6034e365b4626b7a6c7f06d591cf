Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 151 MITM
Message-ID: <20160608234728.GQ32334@dosf1.alfie.wtf>

Hi folks,

Overall I think BIP 151 is a good idea. However unless I'm mistaken, what's to
prevent someone between peers to suppress the initial 'encinit' message during
negotiation, causing both to fallback to plaintext?

Peers should negotiate a secure channel from the outset or backout entirely
with no option of falling back. This can be indicated loudly by the daemon
listening on an entirely new port.
