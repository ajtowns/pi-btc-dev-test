I mean, I think in general solving this problem is probably not possible.
Basically, the fundamental problem is someone else has consumed network
bandwidth that should be paid for with fees. What you're trying to do is
replace a transaction without paying those fees, which is identical to what an
attacker is trying to do, and thus any such scheme will be as vulnerable to
attack as not having that protection in the first place.

...which does give you an out: maybe the attack isn't important enough to
matter. :)
