Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Best practices for dust remining
Message-ID: <53372243.20106@silicon>

Suppose am m-of-n multisig wallet receives a bunch of dust deposits due
to somebody advertising the Olympics, or any other reason, and the users
of the wallet don't want the few satoshis involved.

What is the best way to allow all these dust outputs to be re-mined in
order to clean up the utxo set, keeping in mind the scripts may include
large values of n?
