Clients "inspecting and modifying the transactions" is explicitly *not*
supported. There should be more than enough features for clients to get
bitcoind to generate the exact block they want already available via
Bitcoin Core. The only reason transactions are exposed over the work
protocol at all, really, is so that clients can generate weak blocks to
be sent to the pool for efficient client -> pool block relay, not sure
that's worth bothering to add a whole new endpoint for, sounds
needlessly complicated (and the spec is already more than complicated
enough, sadly).
