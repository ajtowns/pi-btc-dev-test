Glad we're on the same page with regard to what's possible in TXO commitments.

Secondly, am I correct in saying your UTXO commitments scheme requires random
access? While you describe it as a "merkle set", obviously to be merkelized
it'll have to have an ordering of some kind. What do you propose that ordering
to be?

Maybe more specifically, what exact values do you propose to be in the set?
