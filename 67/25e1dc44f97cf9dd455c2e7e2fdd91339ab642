A couple observations:

   - The consensus block limit is different than the disk space required to
   do validation.  Some participants are worried about one and some about the
   other, and sometimes they feel what amounts to an imaginary contention
   because they perceive these two different things as the same.  They are
   both addressed by scaling solutions, but to different degrees.  This is the
   most concrete I can get about my impression whenever someone writes "not
   correct."  Less concrete is my usual impression, "you're both right."

   - "Kicking the can" has value, but no one has connected the value to the
   phrase, so here it is: The more time we have to make changes, the better
   the changes will be.  Of course it's a trade-off (because we suffer through
   that extra time with the unsolved problem), but using (or thinking of)
   "kicking the can" as bad is a mistake.

   - Whether or not there is a massive campaign targeting *current
   bitcoiners* has a very strong effect on upgrade rates.

It seems that a hardfork to a 2MB limit on 5/5/16 is a tad more than one
LOC, since we want an if-then around it so it doesn't happen til the agreed
date.  But I still support it.
