Although I'd say your writing style is a bit unfriendly and hard to 
identify/unclear at the specifics of some of your complaints, I do agree 
with many of your points.

I really have no idea what format the .txt.gz files are in that are on 
the current archive. If you unzip them, they are not text tiles.

gmane was able to change the subscription of the previous list to the 
current list. So, anyone who had a newsreader setup, it should be 
working again. There is some gap in their archive at the beginning of 
the archive, as well as last week while the list was transitioned. They 
requested a link to a single mbox file archive that they can use to 
restore the list archive in it's entirety. Anyone know how we can get 
this? The reference to another mailing list below 
(https://cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/) has such a link on its 
archive page. It looks like the same interface so maybe that feature can 
just be turned on? I'm not sure if it gzips the mbox file on the fly 
whenever an http request is made or if it has some schedule and may be 
missing a few of the most recent messages?


Also, regarding the footer, if it can't be changed on a per user basis, 
I'd vote to get rid of it. Anyone with a reasonably powered brain can go 
to lists.linuxfoundation.org and find a way to get to the bitcoin-dev 
mailing list page. The information provided in the footer is also 
included in the email message headers as well. It's also included in the 
welcome e-mail when someone subscribes to the list.
