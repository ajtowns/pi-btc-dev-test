Nice, Andrew.

Just one minor point. SPV clients do not need to maintain an ever growing
list of PoW solutions. BitcoinJ uses a ring buffer with 5000 headers and
thus has O(1) disk usage. Re-orgs past the event horizon cannot be
processed but are assumed to be sufficiently rare that manual intervention
would be acceptable.
