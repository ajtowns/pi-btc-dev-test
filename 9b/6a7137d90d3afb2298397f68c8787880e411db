Sounds like a good plan.

Do you have a list (possibly incomplete) of apps that perform this kind of checking? We?re currently working with some parties in a supply chain to allow a consumer payment on a retail website to automatically pay supply chain parties, the way BIP70 allows with multiple outputs on a transaction. This behaviour would prohibit this use case.
