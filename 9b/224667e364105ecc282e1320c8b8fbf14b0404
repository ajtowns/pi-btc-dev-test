Why would you call it FUD?   All the weird hemming and hawing about it is
really strange to me.  The more I look into it and speak to professors
about i, the more it seems "so trivial nobody really talks about it".

1. Generate an M of N shared public key (done in advance of signing ....
this gets you the bitcoin address)
2. Generate signature fragments (this can be done offline, with no
communication between participants)

Detailed explanation with code snippets:
