Regarding tor-arm, here are some screenshots:
https://www.atagar.com/arm/screenshots.php

It shows, among other things:
- bandwidth up/down graphs
- CPU usage
- debug logging (in real time)
- connected peers+statistics
- currently active configuration

Would be nice to have a similar tool for bitcoind.
