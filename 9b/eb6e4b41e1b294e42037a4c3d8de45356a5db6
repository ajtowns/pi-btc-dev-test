Hi Greg,

Absolutely, I'd certainly be interested in this being the first
proof/example for the script upgrade mechanisms if it's not ideal for
this to be implemented as part of Segregated Witness itself.

Yes, I think it's necessary to include the fees as part of the
signature, which will also allow for wallets to not require downloading
the input transactions. However, it's necessary to not include the input
amount itself, as they may differ. SegWit itself is very nice in that it
prevents improperly designed wallets and services using the bitcoin RPC
from making mistakes, you can resolve malleability without compromises
-- I also think any proposed SIGHASH should ensure some measure of
safety from design error/shortcuts.

That's a good point, choosing a scary name is probably very helpful.

Thanks, I'll clarify with a specific BIP soon.
