AML/KYC is a *side-effect *of a some very important features of BIP0075.

Features that have nothing to do with public names for wallet seeds,
and moniker *consistency *should be scrapped.

BIP 75 formalises what someone could do today with a bunch of PGP emails
back and forth.

I create a public key, and I exchange it via QR code with you.   From then
on, You can initiate invoice requests with me, knowing my moniker is the
same as it was the last time.   I publish this key to a server (via DNSSEC)
so anyone can obtain it.   Sounds exactly like PGP.

Identity in BIP 75 is merely "moniker consistency".  Nothing says that
identity has to be "real"... only publicly verifiably consistent and
accessible.  This consistency and the ability to have public names for both
merchants and users are the important features of BIP 075.

Other features linking monikers to real-world identity should be surgically
removed from the standard.

- Users need to be able to send Bitcoin to an address without MITM attacks
during the address exchange.

- Merchants need to be able to supply memorable names linked to internet
services, like web servers and email addresses.

- Merchants and users both need to be able to initiate transaction
off-chain, with a workflow that allows things like rejection, subscription,
etc.
