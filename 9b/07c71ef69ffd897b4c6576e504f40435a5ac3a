Although I can only speak for my involvement with MultiBit, the idea of a
randomised client page seems wrong to me, for the reasons given by Alan
earlier.

Equally, in order to further the idea that Bitcoin is more than the
reference client, it is appropriate that other clients are acknowledged and
promoted. Bitcoin.org has by far the most traffic and by directing people
to other clients that may be more suitable to their needs the user
experience is improved considerably. After all, not everyone wants a 2.5Gb+
download before starting out on their Bitcoin adventure.

If the reference client was the best of all possible worlds then there
would be no need for the alternative clients.
