1: IP isn't guaranteed to work correctly both because you might be using a
VPN out Tor.

2: Yes, the site can display all options right away, but are you willing to
read all of them too?

3: Detailed information is not necessary, nor does it have to be
unprompted. It doesn't need to tell you more than which country you are in.
It can even prompt you with a popup that has a slider that shows exactly
how much information and of what kind you're about to share (including
none, if that's your choice).

4: It doesn't need to share raw data. Take a look at anonymous credentials:

5: It can wait for prompting until you add the first item to the cart.
