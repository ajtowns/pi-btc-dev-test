I've cleaned the commit up a bit, and created a pull request (#369) for it.

Nice, we definitely needed something like that. It wouldn't hurt to have multiple
people running such a seed, to prevent problems with occasional outages of DNS seeds,
once we move away from IRC entirely.

Given that there is no public outcry against these programs automatically
opening holes in firewalls, I assume it's safe for us to do the same.

It should be clearly explained in the release notes, though.

Yes.

So: I'm in favor of an emergency release 0.3.24 with upnp default enabled,
dnsseed default enabled, block send limit, no-connect segfault bugfix.
Anything else?
