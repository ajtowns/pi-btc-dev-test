An important part of the design of segwit is that resource constained devices
doing lite-client verification don't need to get witness data at all to verify
lite-client merkle-path proofs.

Remember that lite-clients can't verify anything useful in witnesses anyway, so
for them to have witness data is useless (unless they're doing some kind of
embedded consensus protocol with data published in witnesses, but few people
here care about that use-case).
