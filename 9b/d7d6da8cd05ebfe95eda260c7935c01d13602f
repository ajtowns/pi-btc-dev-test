RE: process:

I like author == primary control, and an "assume they will do the right
thing, revert if they don't"

RE: separate mailing list for BIP discussion:

Great idea. Jeff Garzik was looking for a better mailing list solution than
SourceForge, but assuming
there isn't a clearly better solution I think "we" should create a strictly
moderated bitcoin-bips at lists.sourceforge list.
