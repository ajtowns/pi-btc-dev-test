Hi!

Is this a valid script?

["1 0 1", "WITHIN NOT"]

The first value (1) is tested to make sure it is between the lower (0) and upper (1) value. This evaluates to true, placing on the stack a single byte of [01]. NOT then inverses this to a 0 byte false value of [].

What am I missing here?

Thanks
