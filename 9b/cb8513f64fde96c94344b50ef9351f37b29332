I've made no changes since the last time I've mentioned it here on the list (when the BIP procedures were being discussed).

The last changes are:

01-10-2013 - Expanded the salt to be prefix + date + checksum and renamed 'master seed' to 'root key'.
24-07-2013 - Added user selectable KDF + parameters, encoded in the prefix.
22-07-2013 - Added 2 byte creation date field, as a result, the prefix is expanded to 3 bytes.

The biggest difference between this proposal and BIP38 is that BIP38 allows a 3rd party to generate the encrypted private key + confirmation code from a passphrase code. Since this proposal is about encrypting a random value that's fed into HMAC-SHA512 and the presence of a partial hash of the root address, that's not possible.
