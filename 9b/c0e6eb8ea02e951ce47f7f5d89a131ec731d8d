Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 10X: Replace Transaction Fees with Data,
 Discussion Draft 0.2.9
Message-ID: <CALqxMTFixvQGTqLogDzrv0zhQFH6Z5kBdG9zwqoMuhjPvJadsg@mail.gmail.com>

Some comments:

"(i) remove any possibility of free transactions unless

associated with basic transaction data;"

I believe it is not possible to prevent free transactions for the
reason that people can pay out of band (via existing banking transfers
to miners) or make payments to addresses belonging to miners (that are
contingent on the requested user transaction being processed via input
dependency) .


I am not sure I fully understand the way you see monetisation working,
and you do indicate this is quite far future what-if stage idea, and
you do identify a conflict with fungibility - but I think this is
probably quite badly in conflict with fungibility to the point of
conflicting with many planned Bitcoin improvements?  And mid term
technical directions.

I would say the long term idealised requirements are that the
transaction itself would have cryptographic fungibility, and policy
relating to identity for authorisation, approval in regulated
transactions would take place at the payment protocol layer.  The
payment protocol is already seeing some use.

Lightning protocol sees more of the data going point to point and so
not broadcast nor visible for big data analytic monetisation.
