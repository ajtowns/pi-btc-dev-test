I don't believe anyone is arguing otherwise.  Miners with a larger fraction of the network hash rate, h/H, have a theoretical advantage, all other variables in the miner's profitability equation held constant.  

Dpinna originally claimed (unless I'm mistaken) that his paper showed that this advantage decreased as the block reward diminished or as the total fees increased.  This didn't seem unreasonable to me, although I never checked the math.  

Best regards,
Peter
