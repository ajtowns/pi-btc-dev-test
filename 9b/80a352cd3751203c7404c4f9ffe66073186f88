Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proof-of-Loss -- Errata
Message-ID: <SxMWjK2t9ewJnV8EYSUY9hIccG_MDsVduGIFHbabUmIcv__L46iNj42pWntzyLiknSr8-IZlHZAFI6ynX2zU8TwyhPBPRIs5o5Wi5vGuwUA=@deugh-ausgam-valis.com>

There was an error on page 5 of the paper, which made the block-chaining odds formula confusing. The error was in the text, not in the formula, and consisted of assuming the affected route as always being the rewarded one, which is false. The corrected version is already available at the same URL ([https://proof-of-loss.money](https://proof-of-loss.money/)). The new file's date is 02/07/2017, and downloading it will probably require clearing the browser's cache.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback, preferably directly to my email, to avoid overloading this list with something not directly related to Bitcoin.
