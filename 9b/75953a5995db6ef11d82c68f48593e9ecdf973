I don't see how the fact that my 2Mbps connection causes me to not be a
very good relay has any bearing on whether or not the network as a whole
would be negatively impacted by a 20MB block. My inability to rapidly
propagate blocks doesn't really harm the network. It's only if MOST relays
are as slow as mine that it creates an issue. I'm one node in thousands
(potentially tens or hundreds of thousands if/when Bitcoin goes
mainstream). And I'm an individual. There's no reason at all for me to run
a full node from my home, except to have my own trusted and validated copy
of the blockchain on a computer I control directly. I don't need to act as
a relay for that and as long as I can download blocks faster than they are
created I'm fine. Also, I can easily afford a VPS server or several to run
full nodes as relays if I am feeling altruistic. It's actually cheaper for
me to lease a VPS than to keep my own home PC on 24/7, which is why I have
2 of them.

And as a business, the cost of a server and bandwidth to run a full node is
a drop in the bucket. I'm involved in several projects where we have full
nodes running on leased servers with multiple 1Gbps connections. It's an
almost zero cost. Those nodes could handle 20MB blocks today without
thinking about it, and I'm sure our nodes are just a few amongst thousands
just like them. I'm not at all concerned about the network being too
centralized.

What concerns me is the fact that we are using edge cases like my home PC
as a lame excuse to debate expanding the capacity of the network.
