I realise on reflection that what I really want is not automatic
transmissions, but a means to revoke an address.

The problem is that after transfering the coins from the compromised
addresses to a new, hopefully safe address, what to do about the fact
that third parties might still try to send me coins to an old,
compromised address.  So what I think I'm suggesting is that there
should be an address revocation protocol, such that clients will give
an error if their user tries to send coins to a revoked address.

Unless we think that direct payments to addresses will become
completely obsolete once the payment protocol is in use, in which case
(maybe) this functionality belongs in the payment protocol instead -
but I remain unconvinced of that.

I'm not envisaging something as drastic as changing the rules to make
transactions to revoked addresses invalid - just an overlay protocol.
Although to be useful such a protocol would have to be pretty much
universally implemented by clients.

Thoughts?
