While I think we'd all prefer Core to make changes like this, the current
environment may make that impossible. If this change happens in XT, we will
support the necessary changes in our own implementation. The block size
limit is a problem _today_, and I'd rather we solve today's problems with
today's understanding rather than let speculation about future unknowns
stop our ability to respond to known issues.
