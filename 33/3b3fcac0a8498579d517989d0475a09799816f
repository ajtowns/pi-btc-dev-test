In fact, yes.

In the end it boils down to saying something like: "Bitcoin is a unique 
global distributed application and thus all implementations MUST support 
the version of the protocol currently in use, irrespective of whether it 
have been documented and/or published. This RFC is meant only for 
informational purposes and is a snapshot of the protocol as to Oct 22nd 
2013."

That being said, I understand the idea of not publishing the spec so 
that everyone is forced to work with live data.
