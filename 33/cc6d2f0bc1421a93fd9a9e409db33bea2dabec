OK, give me a shout on IRC. It is a lot of work though, so be prepared. Bring bags of patience :)

I also contacted the IANA about getting the bitcoin URI spec accepted on their 
index, however never heard back. If you want, please have whoever you 
discussed it with get in touch with me. Either way, please be sure whatever 
they index is compliant with the spec on the wiki as-is (especially not being 
BTC unit specific, as this is clearly non-scalable).
