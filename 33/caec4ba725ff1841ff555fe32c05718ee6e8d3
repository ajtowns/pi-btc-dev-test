I have a limit there, yes, but maybe I need to raise it. I'd rather
would like it to simply not jam up instead though. :-)

I don't remember exactly right now, but the Debian packages 'libnfc-bin'
and 'libnfc-examples' have some binaries and I think I used one of them
to present an NFC URI record and I ran into similar problems with
instability.

For their tie-in with the traditional banking system, i.e. cash-out in
fiat. Here in Germany that might currently be the only feasible way of
accepting bitcoins commercially, because of unresolved questions around
VAT - but that's another topic.
