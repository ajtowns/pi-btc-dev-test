We have been discussing something like this over here too, as well as exploring more esoteric blockchain+signature-based "SSO" implementations as discussed by John Light and others.

One of our long-term ambitions with Hive is to provide a (mostly) user-transparent, decentralized authentication service. It sounds like our infrastructure could already handle a Persona implementation, and we very much want to get behind some forward-thinking standard. So as long as the plan _IS_ to remove said 'centralized struts' at the appropriate time, I'd say we're interested in exploring this further.

They also integrate with the Google/Yahoo SSO systems as well. The intention being that they do this until Persona becomes big enough to matter, and then they can remove the centralised struts and the system becomes transparently decentralised.

But the benefit of leveraging Persona would be convenience - you can get yourself a Persona cert and use it to sign in to websites with a single click, and the user experience is smart and professional. CAs in contrast are designed for web site admins really so the experience of getting a cert for an email address is rather variable and more heavyweight.

From the users perspective, their wallet app would embed a browser and drive it as if it were signing into a website, but stop after the user is signed into Persona and a user cert has been provisioned. It can then sign payment requests automatically. For many users, it'd be just one click, which is pretty neat.
