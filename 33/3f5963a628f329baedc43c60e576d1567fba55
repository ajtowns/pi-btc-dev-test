The share (hash power) of a miner is proportional to capital investment, not the newness of that investment. The efficiency of a new mine (inclusive of pooling pressures) can certainly be sufficient to outperform other miners, resulting in the departure of the latter, thus not preventing the entry of the former.

The point you should be making here is that energy consumption is regulated by the cost of capital (in addition to reward value and the cost of energy).

Note that higher efficiency mining does not reduce energy consumption, nor does variation in the necessary cost of mining hardware. The total energy cost is the control, not the hash rate. This is of course why proof-of-memory (space) is pointless. It simply shifts most of the energy cost to hardware manufacture, shipment, etc.
