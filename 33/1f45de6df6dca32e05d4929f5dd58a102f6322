Yes.

Yes.

I don't think I agree with "pretty much everybody", because status-quo bias
is a very powerful thing. Any change that disrupts the way they've been
doing things will generate significant resistance -- there will be 10 or
20% of any population that will take a position of "too busy to think about
this, everything seems to be working great, I don't like change, NO to any
change."

For example, I think some of the resistance for bigger blocks is coming
from contributors who are worried they, personally, won't be able to keep
up with a bigger blockchain. They might not be able to run full nodes from
their home network connections (or might not be able to run a full node AND
stream Game of Thrones), on their old raspberry pi machines.

The criteria for me is "clear super-majority of the people and businesses
who are using Bitcoin the most," and I think that criteria is met.

Yes, that's the way it has mostly been working. But even before stepping
down as Lead I was starting to wonder if there are ANY successful open
source projects that didn't have either a Benevolent Dictator or some clear
voting process to resolve disputes that cannot be settled with "rough
consensus."
