Your statements contradict each other.

This is not a question of whether it is a "huge" cost, but whether there
is an problem of incentive compatibility, which there is not. Miners
incur the opportunity cost of the space that they mine that does not
include the most optimal fees, which is equal in value to those forgone
fees.

If miners exclude available higher-fee transactions, or mine empty
space, or mine their own "recovery" transactions, they are merely
purchasing block space at market rates, just like everyone else.

The only difference is that they are getting nothing in return, while
everyone else is presumably getting a useful monetary transfer. In other
words, they are losing value to do this. Therefore the incentive is to
not do so. But again, the option to do so is perfectly incentive compatible.

I'm not sure who cooked up this myth about miners gaining advantage over
those who buy block space by mining empty space, rejecting higher-fee
transactions, and/or mining "recovery" transactions, but the idea is
complete nonsense.
