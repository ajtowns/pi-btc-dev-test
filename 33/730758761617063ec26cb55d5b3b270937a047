Workflow is all new development takes place in master during release windows. 
Eventually, those windows close and master is cleaned up and bugfix'd for the 
next 0.x release. Occasionally, when 0.N.0 has some problem before the next 
release window opens, Gavin will use it to roll a 0.N.1 (and recently even a 
0.N.2 and 0.N.2.2). Once the release window for the next 0.N version opens,
I import the (last bugfix-only commit after the final 0.N.M release made in 
master) into the stable repository as the 0.N.x branch, and begin applying 
backports. When there's significant backports, I'll tag another 0.N.M from the 
branch and possibly release Windows binaries. Usually this happens around the 
same time as master becomes the next 0.N.0 release.

I guess I've been neglecting to update the stable repo with releases tagged in 
master. It should be fixed now.
