Yes, I think the checkpoints and the compressed headers streams should be
handled in chunks of 2016 headers and queried by chunk number instead of
height, falling back to current method if the chunk is not full yet.

This is cache friendly and allows to avoid bit 0 and bit 1 in the bitfield
(because they are always 1 after the first header in the chunk of 2016).
