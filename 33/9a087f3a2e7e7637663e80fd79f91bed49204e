I think you are perhaps underestimating the effect of 'mere' default
policies.

It would be nice to think that every node was a free thinking individual
that is motivated to vote with their feet, but in practice most people dont
have time.

There is research showing that 80% of users tend to accept defaults.

Rule changes and changing defaults would seem to be things worth weighing.
Bug fixes hopefully should be fairly unanimous.  Of course a grey area
exists in between.
