I don't think anything simple enough to actually be used by people in
general does. Same concept as what I proposed earlier before nanotube gave
me the context for Gavin's intent on irc.

Now that I'm understanding the use case I really think the best way to go
about this initially is like you said earlier.

Provide methods to export/import unsigned txns, provide methods to run the
GUI in a way that can track your own addresses with only pubkeys available
to the client, provide methods to sign and import/export/broadcast signed
txns.

With these tools offline wallets become feasible. Combined with wallet
crypto I think this is really the best that can be done to protect users
from themselves in a way that isn't too complicated for them to actually
use.
