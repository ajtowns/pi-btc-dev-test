This is the only reddit comment I've made using the word revert in
recent memory, so I know you couldn't be referring to another.

>> I was recently in a situation similar to what Gavin is in insofar as a design dispute that could improperly solved by a git push. I'm pretty impressed he hasn't given in and done a midnight push. It's cool to see him back channeling support.

And, I probably should have continued "and resulted with an immediate
revocation of commit rights on the assumption that his account had
been compromised."

There is nothing controversial about that.
