Exactly - knowledge of the English language isn't a binary. Equally, I don't
remember ever learning names of special characters in French class back in
elementary school, but I do recall us drilling the alphabet and especially
numbers repeatedly.

If I were trying to tell a French speaker a BTC address, I'd probably be able
to succesfully do it with bech32, but not with any encoding using special
characters.

FWIW, I also did a partial rust implementation of just the Bech32 encoding for
a prototype non-BTC use-case. Other than the version number being it's own
"chunk" I found it very straight-forward to implement and I think it'll make
for a nice replacement for what otherwise would have been hex digests.
