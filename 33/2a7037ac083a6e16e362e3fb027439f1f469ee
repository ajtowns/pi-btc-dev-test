Just to make sure nobody expects a magic bullet: this was on a hexacore Xeon
CPU, with several GB of -dbcache, libsecp256k1 for verification, and a very good
network connection. It is repeatable and from random network peers, though. The
code is here:

It's usable and seems to be stable (including reindexing, which needs support for
block files with out-of-order blocks now), but I still want to clean some
things up before pullreq'in. There are probably some heuristic tweaks
possible as well - Gregory found that performance is reduced for the first
part of the chain on high-latency networks.

I believe we do need some wider support than just Bitcoin-Qt, indeed, as
the number of people actually using the reference client as a wallet is
quite low now. Ideally, several clients and merchants start support for it
in a short timeframe...
