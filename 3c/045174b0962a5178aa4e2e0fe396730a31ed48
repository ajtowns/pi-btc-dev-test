Copying addresses to the clipboard should be discouraged, rather than
supported.

It is an inherently insecure mechanism. Regardless of the OS used, any
application can monitor the clipboard for Bitcoin addresses and replace
any address with their own, usually without any specific permission or
confirmation by the user. Effectively this steals Bitcoins if the user
doesn't compare addresses manually.

This is a real risk, as this kind of malware has already been seen.

Never copy & paste Bitcoin addresses!
