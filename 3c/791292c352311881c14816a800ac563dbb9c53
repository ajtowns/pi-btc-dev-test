Speaking of, I ported my replace-by-fee branch the recent v0.9.3
release: https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/replace-by-fee-v0.9.3

I actually ported it a few days ago; that release has been running on a
half-dozen or so nodes right now for a few days with no issues.

The v0.9.3 release's scriptSig size limit increase adds a new category
of double-spending exploit. I'm not going to get time to add that
exploit to my replace-by-fee toolkit(1) for at least another week or so
though - pull-reqs accepted.
