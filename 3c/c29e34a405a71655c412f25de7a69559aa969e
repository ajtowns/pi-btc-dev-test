You can't eliminate the complexity (yet), otherwise you wouldn't be able to
talk to old nodes. You'll have to wait until versions prior to a particular
version are hard-forked off and can be safely dropped at connect time.

That said the reason I'm being so grumpy about this is that compared to the
complexity in the rest of the system, this is such a trivial and minor
detail. It's hardly even worth thinking about. I mean, we have a scripting
language full of opcodes nobody ever figured out how to use and the
protocol uses a mixture of byte orders, so an optional field in the version
message is really not such a big deal :)
