You're both right: BIP34's addition of the height is implemented in
the coinbase generator, so for almost everyone the Bitcoind version is
not very relevant for that.  Rejection of invalid chains, however, is
in the Bitcoin daemon.  Upgrading bitcoind alone should be sufficient
to prevent the creation of forks, though if miners would like to avoid
losing income they must update _both_ so that they don't create
invalid blocks or mine on invalid forks.
