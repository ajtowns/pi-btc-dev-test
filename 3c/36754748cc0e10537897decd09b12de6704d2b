Dear Michael,

I'm very supportive of the idea that there should be thorough and adequate
testing of any proposed change in the maximum block size (e.g. to 8MB). See
Peter Todd's earlier posts on the subject.

Let's work together to establish a testing process to establish the
necessary data transparency and real-world telemetry to help remove
uncertainty as best we can.

Evan has suggested that Huobi would require in the order of 3 months of
testings, first on a test-net.

Working back from BIP101's  11 Jan 2016 date, it would appear that such
testing should begin in early-mid October. Hence my offer to host a
face-to-face meeting in Hong Kong October 14-15.

[NOTE: There is a separate, but possibly related blockchainworkshops.org
meeting being planned in HK by Primavera De Filippi and Constance Choi  for
October 12-13. The main meeting room, for 300 people, has been reserved for
this community's use on October 14,15. Cyberport is able to setup IRC,
livestream video etc. and connect with other satellite conference centers
(e.g. one in Shanghai) should that be desired.]

The purpose of such a face-to-face meeting could be discuss the results of
the testing process e.g. the first set of test(s), and engineer any
remaining ones that will be necessary to raise the level of confidence to
help 'mine consensus' for any hard fork.

If anyone is willing to contribute resources to participate in the design,
execution and analysis of such testing, then please post to this thread and
we can take it from there.

Respectfully,

p.
