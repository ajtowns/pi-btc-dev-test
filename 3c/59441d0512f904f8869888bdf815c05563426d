Hi,

What is the purpose for this field? Can I safely ignore it? Currently it isn't used and I can't imagine it being too useful.

If you want to discover your own IP address from it, then that's ripe for abuse. Maybe it could be used in conjuction with your own IP lookup mechanism kind of how the clock works.

What is the main reason for this field existing?
