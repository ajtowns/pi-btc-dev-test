Agreed, although I think waxwing put it better: Bitcoin's most
fundamental property is its neutrality. If it loses this, it is not
Bitcoin.

But I also agree with Gavin that the bitcoin-development email list is a
perfectly good place to have these types of discussions. I myself have
used it repeatedly to publish ideas specifically due to wide readership
and multiple independent archives.

Anyway that's just twitter bootstrap or something; I hear the wizards
