And how does the client discover HTTP trackers?  You're either
hardcoding -those- into the client, or adding an additional bootstrap
step to discover them.  Either way, it has the same problems as other
current methods.

The history and experience of gnutella's web caches vs. UDP host
caches seems highly relevant here.
