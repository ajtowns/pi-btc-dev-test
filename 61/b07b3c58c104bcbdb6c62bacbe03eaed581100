Below are 2 examples why a systematic risk analysis needs to be used. 
The current situation is that you have developers making hyperbolic, 
demonizing statements that users are "spammers" and engaged in Sybil 
"attacks."  Characterizing these activities as spam and Sybil attacks is 
not a systematic analysis, it is closer to the process used at the Salem 
Witch trials.

If this process of demonetization is to take its natural course then 
these statements are "developer attacks" from a developer system that 
lacks proper incentives and is rife with conflicts of interest.
