Ouch.

This sounds like something that $20 of mechanical turk time could help
out with a lot.  Put up the 2048 words and ask people to rate them for
potential offensiveness and threatening. :)

Nouns often make for fairly neutral words, though careful for place
names which have had political complications. E.g. gdansk vs danzig.
