Agreed.  I've seen some amount of use of dnsseeds which I would
consider inadvisable considering their weakness.

Also agreed, we ought to have a separate onionseed process for hosts
which can reach hidden services which would be inherently
authenticated and somewhat more anonymous. The existing introduction
method already doesn't work well for onlynet=onion hosts, so that
would be a good place to start.

I was deliberately vague here in that I'm trying to avoid foreclosing
reasonable activities like omitting nodes which are uselessly slow,
diverged from the network, or running very old software.  The test I'm
suggesting is that if "why am I doing this" is "to connect users to
functioning nodes" then it's probably okay, but if its to achieve some
other end? probably not.

Yes, this is one of the reasons we use DNS (and also one of the
reasons the document suggests a non-zero minimum ttl)... but belt and
suspenders, even though technical measures are protective here it's
good to make it clear that this isn't acceptable.

Yep. That was the intent. (well not testnet, but the notion that if
there really were a good reason to do something else a discussion
should cover it)
