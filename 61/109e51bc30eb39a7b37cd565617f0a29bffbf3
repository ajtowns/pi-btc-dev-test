This is fine, I think. I believe we shouldn't proceed with a hardfork
without having reasonable expectation that it will be deployed by everyone
in time, while we can only measure miner acceptance. Still, as a
belt-and-suspenders this won't hurt.

Given the time recent softforks have taken to deploy, I think that's too
soon.

2016-01-12 00:00 UTC is Monday evening in US and Tuesday morning in China.

That's an interesting thing to take into account.

I have considered suggesting a faster ramp-up in the beginning, but I don't
think there is indisputable evidence that we can currently deal with
significantly larger blocks. I don't think "painful" is the right criterion
either; I'm sure my equipment can "handle" 20 MB blocks too, but with a
huge impact on network propagation speed, and even more people choosing the
outsource their full nodes.

Regarding "reasonable", I have a theory. What if we would have had 8 MB
blocks from the start? My guess is that some more people would have decided
to run their high-transaction-rate use cases on chain, that we'd regularly
see 4-6 MB blocks, there would be more complaints about low full node
counts, maybe 90% instead of 60% of the hash rate would be have SPV mining
agreements with each other, we'd somehow have accepted that even worse
reality, but people would still be complaining about the measly 25
transactions per second that Bitcoin could handle on-chain, and be
demanding a faster rampup to a more "reasonable" 64 MB block size as well.

I know many technologies have had faster growth, but I believe that global
bandwidth accessibility is the bottleneck, so the growth rate in my
proposal is based on that.

I'd rather be conservative here. My primary purpose is trying to create an
uncontroversial proposal that introduces an expectation of growth with
technology.
