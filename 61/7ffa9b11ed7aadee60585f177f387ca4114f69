Fair enough, I guess. Although I think the dummy marker could actually be non-
consensus critical so long as the hashing replaces it with a 0.

There are things scriptSig can do that witness cannot today - specifically add 
additional conditions under the signature. We can always obsolete scriptSig 
later, after segwit has provided an alternative way to do this.

They already can malleate transactions and add garbage to the blocks. I don't 
see the benefit here.
