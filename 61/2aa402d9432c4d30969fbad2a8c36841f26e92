IMO JSON is too prone to gratuitous inefficiency (both at network and CPU 
level), parser bugs, etc. Even the best C implementation (jansson) has serious 
issues with Number handling.

A few years ago, I looked into binary alternatives to JSON and concluded they 
all had problems, while it seems more than reasonable to do even dynamic 
parsing of protobuf messages. So to conclude, I prefer to stick to protobuf 
unless a clearly superior protocol turns up.

X509 is entrenched, so it should remain supported. PGP might make sense for 
people already using it (it provides no real security for un-WoT-networked 
users), but unforunately, few people use it. Correct me if I'm wrong, but IIRC 
Keybase uses blockchain spam, so definitely not something to be encouraged if 
so. Namecoin seems like a more than reasonable decentralised solution, but 
will probably take some real work to implement (not that this is avoidable for 
a general-usage decentralised solution).

What do you mean by this? There's the memo field at least.

I'd discourage anything using BIP 47 due to its serious design flaws.
No reason a regular BIP 32 pub seed can't be used instead.

What do you mean by "replacement addresses" and "UI confirms" here?

Disagree with hard-coding intervals, or mandating specific policies from the 
service providers.

This is wallet policy, but maybe makes sense as a "best practices" BIP.
