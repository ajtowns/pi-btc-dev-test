It's EU law, but the Distance Selling Directive only says "at least
seven days", so the exact period probably varies by country (in the UK
it is 7 days).

But the clock only starts ticking when you receive the goods, and the
Distance Selling Directive allows the supplier 30 days "to execute the
order" (I *think* the 30 days always has to include shipping, because
for consumer contracts title doesn't pass until the goods are
delivered, so the order wouldn't be considered complete until then).

So I think latest possible deadline for returning the goods for refund
could be up to 30 days to execute the order plus "at least 7 days"
(with some countries allowing more).  Plus, conceivably, shipping
time, if some member states have chosen to interpret the 30 day
execution differently.

So I think this adds up to "a couple of months, give or take".  In
practice, though, even a couple of months is a bit on the short time.
What if the goods are delayed.  How many people have had miner orders
outstanding for the best part of a year?
