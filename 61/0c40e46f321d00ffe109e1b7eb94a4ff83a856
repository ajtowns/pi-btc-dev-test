I specifically outlined a scenario where that text isn't relevant: *all*
transaction in a block can be paying out of band.

You're making the incorrect assumption that all transactions have to be
broadcast publicly; they don't.

Otherwise this is nearly the same cost as the rebate fee, since they both involve explicit outputs claimed by the miner, but the rebate goes back to you. So why would you not want to do that instead?

It certainly does not. It simply adds another level of complexity and overhead
to the out-of-band payment situation, which is not desirable. If we can't
eliminate out of band payments entirely, we do not want to make the playing
field of them even more unbalanced than it already is.

This is a typical academic proposal that only considers first order effects
while ignoring second order effects.
