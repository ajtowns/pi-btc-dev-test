Sure, here's one:

Green address provider give a REST-ful API, that provides the
following functionality:

+ Give transaction ID and credentials, request that the transaction be
declared "green"
  (sender's wallet site/software would do this)

+ Give transaction ID, return boolean "has this transaction been
deeclared green?"



As I said, I think any design that relies on clients recognizing two
variations of a transaction is a very bad idea.
