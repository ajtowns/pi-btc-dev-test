Hi Chuck,

Both Bitcoin Core and bitcoinj are about to ship with the protocol as-is,
so any changes from this point on have to be backwards compatible.

That's all you need to prove payment, yes.

That's right (+memo). And to provide an additional hook for future
features, like recurring billing, ECDH key agreements etc.

Refund addresses as specced currently are optional. For instance bitcoinj
currently doesn't use them and won't until HD wallets support is done.

Let's get some practical experience with what we've got so far. We can
evolve PaymentRequest/Payment/PaymentACK in the right direction with
backwards compatible upgrades, I am hoping.
