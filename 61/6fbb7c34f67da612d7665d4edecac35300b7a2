Subject: [Bitcoin-development] SCRIPT_VERIFY_STRICTENC and CHECKSIG NOT
Message-ID: <20141106103820.GA17096@savin.petertodd.org>

So right now git head will accept the following invalid transaction into
the mempool:

0100000001140de229e08fda25cbc16ded2618cdacce49fcb18c0b6ccdace00040909adae4000000009000493046022100f7828d81c849c5448ba5ba4ef55df6b4d0ba3ae3f1a59cff3291880c2c8e524f022100d2f5bc9dc2f0674eded31023cb47e61a596e10f8f1ddd44cf92d290c9db577c70144410778d430274f8c5ec1321338151e9f27f4c676a008bdf8638d07c0b6be9ab35c71a1518063243acd4dfe96b66e3f2ec8013c8e072cd09b3834a19f81f659cc3455ac91ffffffff01102700000000000017a914e661a2229cc824329c9409f49d99cb5ac350c9288700000000

which spends the redeemScript:

0778d430274f8c5ec1321338151e9f27f4c676a008bdf8638d07c0b6be9ab35c71a1518063243acd4dfe96b66e3f2ec8013c8e072cd09b3834a19f81f659cc3455
CHECKSIG NOT

That pubkey is valid and accepted by OpenSSL as it's obscure "hybrid"
format. The transaction is invalid because the signature is correct,
causing CHECKSIG to return 1, which is inverted to 0 by the NOT.

However the implementation of the STRICTENC flag simply makes pubkey
formats it doesn't recognize act as through the signature was invalid,
rather than failing the transaction. Similar to the invalid due to too
many sigops DoS attack I found before, this lets you fill up the mempool
with garbage transactions that will never be mined. OTOH I don't see any
way to exploit this in a v0.9.x IsStandard() transaction, so we haven't
shipped code that actually has this vulnerability. (dunno about
alt-implementations)

I suggest we either change STRICTENC to simply fail unrecognized pubkeys
immediately - similar to how non-standard signatures are treated - or
fail the script if the pubkey is non-standard and signature verification
succeeds.

Thoughts?
