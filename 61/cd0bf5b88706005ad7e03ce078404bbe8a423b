Yes, but with a key distinction.   Today miners may collude to (or unintentionally) lower the block size limit for blocks they win.  BIP-100 introduces the possibility of lowering the block size limit for everyone over the next 12,000 blocks.

Another gap involves laziness.  What is a far more likely issue is not a conspiracy but that miners will be lazy and hard code their vote values, requiring arm twisting later to change them.  Preventing this headache introduces the need for more complexity, either by making the default a non-vote (which makes it easier to game the system with less voting power), or by making the default vote = MAX_BLOCK_SIZE * 1.09 (which makes the default similar is to Gavin's proposal).

I think with a default vote that is ~9% larger than the previous max block size and no option to lower the max block size then BIP-100 could work without added risk or defeating the intended purpose.  Still, one has to ask if the benefit is there to justify the additional moving parts.
