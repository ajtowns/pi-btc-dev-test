The question becomes there-- how should it work.

In an ideal world, we'd decide what peers to fetch headers from based
on a compact proof of the total work in their chains... but we cannot
construct such proofs in Bitcoin today.

I think that instead of that a weak heuristic is to fetch first from
the peers with the tip at the highest difficulty. Then work backwards.

See: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Gmaxwell/Reverse_header-fetching_sync

Which is the inspiration for the current headers first sync, but
without the reverse part because the protocol didn't permit it: you
can't request a linear wad of headers that come before a header. This
is the thing I was mostly thinking of when I mentioned that we may
want to change the interface.
