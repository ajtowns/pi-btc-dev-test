IsStandard() is for accepting transactions into the memory pool.
Non-standard transactions are verified just fine when they are in the block
chain.

BIP16/17 both create transactions that, when interpreted as old scripts,
are valid. The only change to the protocol is that previously-valid
transactions become invalid. As long as a supermajority of miners enforce
the new rules, everyone can happily keep using their old bitcoin client.
They won't create the new transaction type, and don't accept them as
payment, but they will accept the new block chain.

If we do a breaking change to the protocol - such as adding a new
transaction type - ALL users must upgrade. Those who don't will see a fork
of the chain from before the first new-style transaction. That is not the
case now.
