Trezor's "plausible deniability" scheme could very well result in you going to
jail for lying to border security, because it's so easy for them to simply
brute force alternate passwords based on your seeds. With that, they have proof
that you lied to customs, a serious offense.

I would strongly advise you not to use it in that situation.
