If I first remove \u0000, so the non-normalized passphrase is
"\u03D2\u0301\U00010400\U0001F4A9", and then NFC normalize it, it
becomes "\u03D3\U00010400\U0001F4A9"

UTF-8 encoded this is: 0xcf93f0909080f09f92a9 (not the same as what
you got, Andreas!)

Encoding private key: 5Jajm8eQ22H3pGWLEVCXyvND8dQZhiQhoLJNKjYXk9roUFTMSZ4
with this passphrase, I get a BIP38 key of:
6PRW5o9FMb4hAYRQPmgcvVDTyDtr6R17VMXGLmvKjKVpGkYhBJ4uYuR9wZ

I recommend rather than simply removing control characters from the
password that instead the spec require that passwords containing
control characters are invalid. We don't want people trying to be
clever and putting them in thinking they are adding to the password
entropy.

Also for UI compatibility across many platforms, I'm also in favor
disallowing any character below U+0020 (space)

I can submit a PR once we figure out why Andreas's passphrase was
different than what I got.
