@Matt
I didn't thought about firstbits scalability, but the "registering
crap" and squatting arguments don't apply to green addresses because
no one wants fancy or easy to memorize names there. Is just a way to
make the bitcoin addresses shorter in the green addresses protocol to
be able to have various of them in the same QR-code.

@Amir
I see, the point is to be able to type the alias directly into the client.

I like the DNS proposal. This would allow for both well known working
centralized technology and namecoin (not proven, but decentralized)
options to be used.
