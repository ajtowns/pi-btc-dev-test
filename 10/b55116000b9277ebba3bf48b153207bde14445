Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Synchronization: 19.5 % orphaned blocks
 at height 197'324

I had the same problem (repeatedly) which came down a hardware problem.  Bitcoin
more than other applications is very sensitive to single bit flips in memory or
during computation.  (In the end I under-clocked my CPU and RAM to fix the
problem)

Attached is a small python script which will run sha256 on random data
repeatedly and will print a message if a mismatch is found.  For me it took many
hours of running before a sha256 mismatch, but one is enough to fork the
blockchain.

"The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by
the tribe.  If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened.
But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself."
