No, not really.

The UTXO set is the state you need to validate blocks and
transactions. You can see blocks as authenticated patches to the UTXO
set (consumes some outputs, produces others). During validation, we
store "undo data", basically (non-authenticated) reverse patches to
the UTXO set, so we can walk back in case of a reorganization.
