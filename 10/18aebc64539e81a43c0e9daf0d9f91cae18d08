Some people may want it all ...

Balance at Point-In-Time summaries (say up to the penultimate 
difficulty adjustment) would be one simple way.
And make new-adopters get up and running in minutes not days, which can 
only be a good thing.

If going that route, then solutions to the 'consolidate 
addresses/wallets' question and formal 'discard' of addresses could get 
addressed.
