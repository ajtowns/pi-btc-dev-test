We? I don't feel like I have any authority to say what goes into that
repository, and neither do you. We just give technical opinion on
proposals. The fact that it's under the bitcoin organization on github
is a historical artifact.

Editorial control is inevitable to some extent, but I think that's
more a matter of process than of opinion. Things like "Was there
community discussion?", "Is it relevant?", "Is there a reference
implementation?". I don't think that you objecting for moral reasons
to an otherwise technically sound idea is a reason for removal of a
BIP. You are of course free to propose alternatives, or recommend
against its usage.
