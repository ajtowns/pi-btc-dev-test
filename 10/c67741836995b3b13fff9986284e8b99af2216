- It would be cool if any rate-limiting POW was specified as bytecode ...
so nodes can plug in as many "machine-captcha" things as they please, and
solvers can choose to solve... or just say "nope too hard".

- Alternately, it would be a lot nicer if you just required people to pay a
nanobit .... that could prevent DDOS even better, and generate a revenue
stream for nodes.
