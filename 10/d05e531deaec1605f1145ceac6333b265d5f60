Speaking of, a relatively simple thing that would help dispel these
notions would be if some wallets supported replace-by-fee-using
fee-bumping and an "attempt undo" button. Armory is an (unfortunately!)
special case because it uses a full node and has good privacy
guarantees, but most wallets could implement this by just sending the
doublespend transactions to any node advertising either the
replace-by-fee or GETUTXO's service bits.
