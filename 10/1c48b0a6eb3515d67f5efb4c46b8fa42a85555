Subject: [Bitcoin-development] FYI: pull-tester status
Message-ID: <CABsx9T1y8bg9-OXZZf8KtM7c4z5p_tqPqNe1WfQeg9eKEWwE2g@mail.gmail.com>

Since the autotools merge, the pull-tester has been misbehaving-- marking
valid pulls as invalid, etc.

So I've turned off some pull-tester features until somebody has time to
figure out how to fix them. Right now, pull-tester does the following:

+ Cross-compile windows binaries
+ Compile linux binaries
+ Run unit tests (binaries compiled on linux)

The following features are turned off:

- Running unit tests under wine with cross-compiled windows binaries
- Running the block-chain-compatibility tester
- Computing code coverage

Medium-term, there are several changes that need to be made to the
pull-tester environment; I'd like the following to get done:

+ Upgrade the pull-tester machine from Ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04. Or, probably
better, create a new 12.04 virtual machine and move the pull-tester over to
it.

+ Upgrade compilers/dependencies based on what we think we'll use for the
0.9 release.

+ Figure out how to unify the pull-tester and gitian build processes.
 Maybe the pull-tester should run gitian builds to create binaries (that
are then tested against the blockchain tester)? Maybe the pull-tester
scripts should be gitian scripts, which the pull-tester machine runs inside
an LXC container?
