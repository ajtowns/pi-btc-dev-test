You are going to want to include the block of the Phatom project as well:
https://code.google.com/p/phantom/
fd00:2522:3493::/48

And the one for 'garlicat' for I2P, which might be more complex due
to I2P's addressing:
fd60:db4d:ddb5::/48

Note that while these blocks are not expected to be routable, that
people may in fact have interfaces, routing tables and packet filters
on their machines configured with up to all three of those networks
for the purposes therein.
