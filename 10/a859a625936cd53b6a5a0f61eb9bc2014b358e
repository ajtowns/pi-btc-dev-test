Mike Hearn,

I challenge you to a public debate with the following conditions:

- - the topic is Bitcoin
- - 15 minutes in length (19mins including breaks)
- - 3 sessions of 5 minutes each
- - each speaker makes one statement in each session, not exceeding 2mins
- - 2 minute breaks between sessions
- - we agree to an arbiter
- - a public venue with an international audience
- - I make the first statement versus your already well-established
position and widely publicized views.
- - each speaker commits to making 3 statements and participating in the
full duration of the event - 19 minutes
- - the footage will be published as-is with no editing or right to
forfeiture, showing both participants at all times.
- - to protect myself from your "official" friends, the event will be
unannounced and will start when you see me on an event panel.

sincerely,
Venzen Khaosan
