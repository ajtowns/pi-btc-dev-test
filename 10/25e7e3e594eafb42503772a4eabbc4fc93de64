Everybody knows that https is broken and insecure, and everybody knows
that it's still better than nothing

Just reacting here because there is worse: you are quoting Kraken, did
not check for Coinbase but Kraken is proxying all of its https traffic
via Cloudflare, including the API traffic

This is crazy but that's how things are, that's what everybody is doing,
that's what we have

The https principles are obsolete, the concept of certificates tied to a
domain is a complete stupidity, because there are no concept of domains
in bitcoin for example (and webrtc, Tor, bittorrent, p2p systems, etc)
and should evolve to something like certificates tied to an entityID
managed by something like a blockchain system, and not a stupid domain or CA

Therefore specifying things for bitcoin ? la web is not a good idea,
browsers can do far better than standard/usual web, and the "like
everybody is doing" argument is not a valid one
