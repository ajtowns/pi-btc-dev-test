For section "Formally defining consensus",

Where objections were not deemed substantiated by the community, clear
reasoning must be offered.

For section "BIP Comments",

Comments should be solicited on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, and
summarized fairly in the wiki; with notice of summarization and time
for suggesting edits on the mailing list.  Wiki registration and
monitoring should not be a required hurdle to participation.
