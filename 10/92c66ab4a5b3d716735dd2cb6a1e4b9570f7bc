I'm currently working on headers-first sync, which I believe is generally
very useful (it fixes tons of edge-cases block synchronization currently
experiences), but it's also a first step towards SPV mode.

So headers-first sync means you first synchronize just the headers, and then,
when you already know (or have strong evidence for a guess on) the best chain,
start requesting blocks along that best chain - potentially in parallel from
different peers.

SPV mode is basically headers-first sync, but never do the full block sync
step, and replace it with a bloom/birthday/...-based fetching of blocks
interesting to the associated wallets. In SPV you'll also need to disable
the mempool though, and there will be more small changes, but I think
the separate headers-sync phase will be most of the work.
