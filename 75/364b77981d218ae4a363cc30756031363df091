I can't speak for Namecoin. As for the HTTPS requirement, I'm on the 
fence. Without it, the resolution is open to a man in the middle attack. 
Perhaps HTTPS should be required, and if HTTP is used, a large warning 
message is displayed.

As for the answered message format, is JSON the assumed structure that 
would be used?
