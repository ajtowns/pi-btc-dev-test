The suggested change is actually very simple (minutes of coding) and
elegant and addresses precisely the identified problem. It is actually a
mental shortcut in the assumption of how probability works when mining a
chain. The paper simply corrects this error - nice work!

You suggestion could perhaps be fun for other purposes, but does not
rule out pools of "selfish miners". Further, it binds physical state
(ip) to the blockchain, which has so far held no assumptions on the
technology of the system on which it is running.
