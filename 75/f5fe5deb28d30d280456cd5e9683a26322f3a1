My solution would be quick to implement and could help increase the number
of nodes in the short term. It will also smooth the way towards splitting
off the wallet from Bitcoin Core, by giving people a choice what wallet
they use with their full node.

That doesn't preclude looking for longer-term solutions that change the
incentive structure, but that is much more difficult and risky. I don't
believe it's a matter of 'fixing that instead' in a few hours, though I
nevertheless look forward to your pull request.
