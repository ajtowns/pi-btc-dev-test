I think people in this community often miss the serious political and
legal ramifications of hard-forks. Being in the social position of being
able to succesfully pull off hard-forks, particularly for new features,
is clear evidence that you have de-facto control over the system.
Regulators around the world appear to be going in directions that would
make that control subject to regulation and licensing, e.g. the European
Banking Association proposals, and initial Bitlicense proposals.

Equally, look how hard-forks - known as flag days elsewhere - are
generally considered to be dangerous and worth avoiding in other
contexts due to simple engineering reasons. It's just easier to upgrade
systems in backward compatible ways, especially when they incorporate
features specifically to make that possible. (as does bitcoin!)

This is a misconception; you can't prevent soft-forks from happening, so
you always have an SPV level of security by that standard.

People put *way* too much trust in small numbers of confirmations...
