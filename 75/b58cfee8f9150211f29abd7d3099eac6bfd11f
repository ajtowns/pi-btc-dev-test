Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin miner heads-up: "getwork" RPC going
	away
Message-ID: <CAJHLa0OW9TeJrh6J8mAnx8Zy0i+AoF_1Mrp0Wn+5kZGex3_uJg@mail.gmail.com>

"getwork" has long been unused on mainnet, and mostly unused elsewhere
as well.  It generates work by a method that cannot keep up with the
demands of the modern network.

As such, it is planned to remove "getwork" in the next release.  Most
if not all pool servers have switched away from "getwork" years ago.
