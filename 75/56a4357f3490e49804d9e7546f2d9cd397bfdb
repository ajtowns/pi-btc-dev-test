No, this doesn't make any sense. Multisig outputs are a tool you use to
build helpful features, not a feature in and of themselves.

By all means create a nice protocol, implementation and BIP for something
like:

- Creation of multi-user money pools for managing an organisations funds
- Dispute mediated transactions
- Watchdog services that provide a third party risk analysis of transactions
- Micropayment channels (actually me and Matt already did this, sans BIP)

but trying to do just "multisig" won't work well.
