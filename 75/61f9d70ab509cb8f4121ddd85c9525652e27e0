I don't really see how you can protect against total isolation of a node
(POS or POW).  You would need to find an alternative route for the
information.

Even encrypted connections are pointless without authentication of who you
are communicating with.

Again, it is part of the security model that you can connect to at least
one honest node.

Someone tweated all the bitcoin headers at one point.  The problem is that
if everyone uses the same check, then that source can be compromised.

Headers first mean that you can't knock a synced node off the main chain
without winning the POW race.

Checkpoints can be replaced with a minimum amount of POW for initial sync.
This prevents spam of low POW blocks.  Once a node is on a chain with at
least that much POW, it considers it the main chain.,
