You are correct.  It is also counterproductive to take cheap shots at 
vendors in order to garner consulting revenue.  Measuring risk in a 
systematic way against known metrics is the way to go.  Tweeting, 
blogging, and drama are generally counterproductive.

When the issue is raised most of the developers shun the idea so until 
some of the developers become mature and experienced you will be left 
with all this teenager nonsense where everybody calls each other 
"trolls" on Reddit instead of engaging in real risk analysis.
