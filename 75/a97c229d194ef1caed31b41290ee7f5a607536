That does require trusting the third party not to later tamper with
the payment request, though.  (I'm assuming that a signed payment
request is not always going to be all that useful in the case of
private individuals, even assuming the payee is willing to sign up for
one.)

That certainly sounds like a plausible use case.  You do still have
the problem that e-mail is an insecure channel, but it's no worse than
exchanging Bitcoin addreses over e-mail as things stand at the
moment.
