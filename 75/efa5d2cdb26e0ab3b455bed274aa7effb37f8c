I'm probably very naive, but the fact that the authentication key is your
Bitcoin address was for me a great feature :)
What are the risks associated of id yourself with a bitcoin address you
plan to use on the website for transaction ?

I mean, what is the difference between doing that, and id with a login/pass
and add your bitcoin address in a settings field ? (knowing you could
always find a mechanism to transfer the account to another bitcoin address
if needed)
