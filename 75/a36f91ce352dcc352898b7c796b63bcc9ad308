Hi Sumit,

There's no protocol api to fetch a single transaction over the p2p network.
You can query peers for mempool transactions, but once there are into a
block, no way to obtain them without fetching the entire block.

Also, you may want to take a look to spruned (
https://github.com/gdassori/spruned), it uses both the electrum & the p2p
network to do the same job you are researching on. It serves the data by
emulating some of the bitcoind rpc api, to be suitable by bitcoind backed
applications.

Guido
