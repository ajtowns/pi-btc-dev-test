Certainly, that's supported by all 3 implementations:

 - With c-lightning you can either configure `bitcoin-cli` to connect to
   a remote node with the `rpcconnect`, `rpcuser`, and `rpcpassword`
   options in the `bitcoin.conf` file (at which point all calls to
   `bitcoin-cli` will use that node) or you can use the following
   command line options when starting `lightningd`: `--bitcoin-rpcuser`,
   `--bitcoin-rpcpassword` and `--bitcoin-rpcconnect`
 - lnd allows you to specify the node to connect to using the command
   line options `--bitcoind.rpchost`, `--bitcoind.rpcuser`, and
   `--bitcoind.rpcpass`.
 - Eclair requires you to edit the configuration file [1] before
   compiling afaik

Cheers,
Christian
