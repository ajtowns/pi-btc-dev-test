I have a question regarding this part. I wrote a BIP for base 58 encoding / encryption of BIP 32 root keys. The BIP page states that we shouldn't add to this list ourselves, but should contact you for a BIP number. I have contacted you a couple times on bitcointalk for a BIP number, but haven't received a response (or do those requests explicitly have to go to your email address)? 

Proposal in question: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=258678.0


Cheers,
