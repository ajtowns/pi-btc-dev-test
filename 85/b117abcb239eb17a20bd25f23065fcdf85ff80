If I send a transaction to an IoT device (say to an OpenDime or to the old
Firmcoin), and the OpenDime must verify that the transaction has been mined
(SPV verification), then it may expect the witness program to be of certain
maximum size (an implementation-imposed  limit). If a Miner modifies the
witness size and makes it too large, then the device may not be able to
accept the transaction and the bitcoins may be lost. Lost because the
private key is in the device, and because the device cannot accept that
cloned transaction, never ever.

The same is true (although less strict) for side-chains and drive-chains:
they may have certain restrictions on the size of transactions they accept
to lock bitcoins.

That's why I'm proposing that a transaction becomes INVALID if the witness
size is higher than the expected size (by the sender).
