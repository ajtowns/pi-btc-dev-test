Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Long-term mining incentives
Message-ID: <CAH+jCTwV+koxVwVqvdWn+xXfnX9SX=yJJpFu7rvCNn6uKS8eFg@mail.gmail.com>

I hope to keep continuing this conversations. Pardon my absence, but I
don't alway feel like I have much to contribute especially if it's not
techincal.

On my part I have been a proponent, of an alterrnativ consensus, that
begins shifting away from teh current cooinbase reward system in order to
reduce mining on the whole and thus limit those who do mine to do so on a
level of integrity.


I took a look at the ethereum blog on weak subjectivity, it does seem to be
a good transtition to use a gravity schema to be implemented in a Log
Structured Merge tree  in order to find doscrepancy in forks.


Using this sama data structure could still be used in a consensus model. In
terms of how nodes communicate on teh network their speed and latency
communication are at least halfway solved based off their intereactions
(kernel software changes) with how nodes write and read memory { smp_wrb()
 || smp_rmb() } This would allow for a connection on the


Let me provide a use case:  Say that we wanted to begin a new model for
integrity, then the current value for integrity would utilize a OTS from
the previous hash in order to establish the previous owner address of the
block it was previously part of.  THE MAIN ISSUE here is being able to
verify, which value of integrity is useful for being able to establish a
genesis block. A paper by Lee & Ewe (2001) called *The Byzantine General's
Problem* gives insight as to how a  O(n^c) model is suitable to send a
message w/ value through out the system, each node is then sent a
read-invalidate request in order to change their cache logs for old system
memory in a new fixed address. Upon consensus of this value the rest of the
"brainer" {1st recipeients} nodes would be able to send a forward
propagation of  the learnt value and, after acceptance the value would then
be backpropagated to the genesis block upoon every round in orderr to set a
deterministic standard for the dynamic increase of integrity of the system.


In POW systems the nonce generated would be the accumulation of the
integrity within a system and what their computatiuonal exertion in terms
of the overall rate of integrity increase in the system as the new coinbase
-> this value then is assigned and signed to the hash and teh Merkel Root
 as two layers encoded to its base and then reencrypted using EDCSA from
the 256 to 512 bit transformation so that the new address given has a
validity that cannot be easily fingerprinted and the malleability of teh
transaction becomes much more difficult due to the overall  2 ^ 28
verification stamp provided to the new hash.   The parameters  T T r P

(Trust value)  -> foud in the new coinbase or the scriptSig
( Hidden) -> found in the Hash, and the merkel root hash
(TRust overall)  R = within the target range for  new nonces and address
locations
Paradigm (integrity) = held within the genesis block as a backpropogated
solution



Using this signature then the  nodes would then be able to communicate and
transition the memory resevres for previous transaction on the block based
on the byzantine consensus. What noone has yet mentioned which I have
forgotten too, is how these datacenters of pool woul be supported w/out
fees. I will thrw that one out to all of you.  The current consensus system
leaves room for orp[haned transactions if there were miltiple signature
requests the queue would be lined up based off integrity values in order to
have the most effective changes occcur first.

I have some more thoughts and will continue working on the techinical
vernacular and how a noob developer and decent computer science student
could make such an mplementation a reality.  Thanks in advance for
listengin to this.



<Thank you to Greg Maxwell for allowing us to liosten to his talk online,
was hearing while writing this.>  And to Krzysztof Okupsi and Paul
McKenny(Memory Barriers Hardware View for Software hackers) for their help
in nudging my brain and the relentles people behind the scenes who make all
our minds possible.
