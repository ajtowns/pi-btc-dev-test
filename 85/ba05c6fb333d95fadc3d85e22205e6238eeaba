Matt, I for one do not think that the block size limit should be raised at
this time. Matt Corallo also started the public conversation over this
issue on the mailing list by stating that he was not in favor of acting now
to raise the block size limit. I find it a reasonable position to take that
even if you feel the block size limit should be raised at some time in the
future, there are reasons why now is not the best time to do it.
