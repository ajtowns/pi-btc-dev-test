There is no way for a client to know in advance whether any broadcast 
transaction contains a send to an address in its wallet.  So every incoming 
transaction has to be examined.

Then, there is no way to know if while you were offline any of the 
transactions in the blocks you missed contained transactions for an address 
in your wallet.

Also, a feature I am interested in supporting is a split wallet -- where the 
private key is held elsewhere.  I'd still want to be able to report the 
current balance in a particular address though.  That address can be added 
at any time.

Also, I would like to make some blockexplorer-like facilities available to 
lightweight clients.

We're only talking about one verifying one (or minimal numbers of) blocks; 
"efficient" isn't really going to matter much in that context.  Also, if 
we're talking about a situation where we don't necessarily trust the remote, 
we've got to verify the whole block, not just the one transaction we're 
interested in, since we told the remote which one we were interested in when 
we requested it.

Is the filter going to be filter-by-address then?  I misunderstood in that 
case, I thought you were talking about filter-by-hash, which obviously tells 
you nothing about the contents of the transaction.

That's good to know.  I'm trying to be circumspect in what my client does; I 
want to be 100% compatible, which means if I need a new feature, it's got to 
be in the official client first.

I accept that this is all big talk, and there are plenty of people who start 
new clients and then give up; which might still happen to me.
