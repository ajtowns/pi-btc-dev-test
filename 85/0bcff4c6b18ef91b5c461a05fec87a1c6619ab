Hmm, you might be right, as queries
dig @node.alexykot.me testnet-seed.alexykot.me
?and
dig @node.alexykot.me -p 18353 testnet-seed.alexykot.me?

?are giving different authority sections.

Hmm, but if I setup custom SOA record for it - it should work, right?
What SOA name should it be actually, assuming that NS record for
testnet-seed.alexykot.me is pointing at alexykot.me?


Best regards,
Alex Kotenko
