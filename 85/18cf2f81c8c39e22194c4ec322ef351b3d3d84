A thought occurred to me.  We already run a decentralised system, but it's 
done by making everyone duplicate all other work.  There is no fundamental 
reason why all work needs to be duplicated though.  What about this: every 
node randomly chooses whether to verify any particular transaction.  If we 
assume the network is large and the random factor is correctly chosen, then we 
can still guarantee that every transaction is verified.  Then, we simply add a 
protocol message that is a negative-announce transaction.  That is to say, we 
give nodes a way of telling other nodes that they think a transaction is 
invalid.  The other nodes are then free to verify _that_ assertion and forward 
the negative-announce.

Miners can then listen for negative-announcements and use them to decide were 
to dedicate their verification efforts.  They then don't need to verify all 
(or perhaps even any) transactions themselves and can dedicate their 
processing power to mining.

(I've actually mentioned this idea before, but that time I was using it as a 
double-spend prevention method).
