No, I do not. I am saying that some degree of editorial control will
inevitably exist, simply because there is some human making the choice of
assigning a BIP number and merging. My opinion is that we should try to
restrict that editorial control to only be subject to objective process,
and not be dependent on personal opinions.

I think that you are free to express dislike of BIP75. Suggesting to remove
it for that reason is utterly ridiculous to me, whatever you want to call
it.
