Hmm, at least people can choose not to reuse addresses currently --
if everyone were using taproot and that didn't involve hashing the key,
there would be no way for individuals to hedge against quantum attacks
in case they're ever feasible, at least that I can see (well, without
moving their funds out of bitcoin anyway)?

Even "X + H(X|script)g" with X being a random point would end up
attackable, since that would almost always end up corresponding with a
valid public key that a successful attack could then find a private key
for.

(It seems like using the point at infinity wouldn't work because 
P = 0+H(0||S)g = H(0||S)g, so as soon as you tried to spend it via S,
someone watching the mempool would know H(0||S), which is the secret key
for P, and be able to spend it via the pubkey path -- no quantum crypto
needed. Or am I missing something?)

Also, if the people currently reusing addresses tend to cycle the funds
through fairly quickly anyway, they might be able to simply stop doing
that when quantum attacks start approaching feasibility. If funds are
being held in reused addresses over the long term, that would be more
of a problem though...

Yeah, that was one of the assumptions for
http://www.jbonneau.com/doc/DBBCB15-CCS-provisions.pdf iirc. 

(Also, pretty sure you mean "advantageous", but at least I learnt a new
word today)
