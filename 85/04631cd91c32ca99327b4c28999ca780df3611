Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Payment processors that support testnet?
Message-ID: <20131220173000.GE3180@nl.grid.coop>

Are there any bitcoin to fiat currency processors (like bitpay,
coinbase, etc) that allow testing using the bitcoin testnet?

It seems most of the credit card payment processor apis have 
features to allow developers to do testing without 'real money',
what's the equivalent of this for bitcoin when you need to do
end-to-end testing that goes from BTC to a USD or EU denominated
bank accound?
