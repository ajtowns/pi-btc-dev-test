You'll get that error even with the headers installed, because the makefile 
doesn't add the proper include paths to GCC.

To build, I first: sed -i s/static/dynamic/ makefile.unix # because static 
libraries aren't standard on my OS (nor should they be)

Then: make -f makefile.unix DEBUGFLAGS="-I/usr/include/db4.8 -ggdb -O0" \
      -j4 USE_UPNP=1 bitcoind
