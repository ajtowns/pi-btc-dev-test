While not exactly the most rigorous link,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB#Bugs_and_Reliability seems like an
okay place to start. One thing I can attest to is that, when Armory used
LevelDB (0.8 - 0.92, IIRC), quite a few users had DB corruption issues,
particularly on Windows. Even when a switch to LMDB occurred for 0.93,
loads of complaints would come in from users whose LevelDB-based Core
DBs would fail. I know that the guy who moved Armory over to LMDB would
love to have more time in the day so that he could write a Core patch
that does the same. It's a very sore spot for him.

(FWIW, LMDB seems to work quite nicely, at least once you patch up the
source a little bit. The latest version is also compatible with Core's
cross-compiling scheme. I'd love to see it added to Core one day.)
