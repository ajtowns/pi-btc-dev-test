The problem is that rule 3 of BIP 125 requires you pay a fee that is higher
than the the fee of T_a *plus* the fee of the sweep-transaction that the
Alice has added as a unconfirmed child transaction to T_a because
double-spending to pay Alice and Bob invalidates Alice's
sweep-transaction.  Alice's sweep-transaction is very large, and hence pays
a large absolute fee even though her fee-rate is very low.  We do not have
any control over its value, hence Alice has "pinned" our RBF transaction.

Yes, that is what I mean.  My proposal was off-the-mark.

Surely CPFP is already computing the package-fee rates of mempool
transactions.  That is the value we need to compute.
