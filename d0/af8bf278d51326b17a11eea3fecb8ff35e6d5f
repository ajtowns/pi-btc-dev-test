Because payments are the only thing everyone using Bitcoin has agreed to use 
the blockchain for. Furthermore, there is no *reason* to store non-payments in 
the blockchain. If there was in fact such a use case, things might be arguable 
- but there isn't any I'm aware of.

The issue is using other peoples' resources for something they did not agree 
to use it for. The fees aren't merely "not enough", they were never *intended* 
to be "cost of storage". They are "cost of security" and "prevent spamming".

The concepts behind Bitcoin are applicable to future innovation, but this can 
all be accomplished without spamming Bitcoin itself.

Non-payments are quite possible without the Bitcoin blockchain itself. If 
you're worried that not enough people will store the alternative-non-payment 
data, then you are essentially saying that voluntary participation is not 
enough and that forced storage is your solution. I don't think this is what 
you intend...

The Bitcoin blockchain protocol has 95 bytes per block reserved for miners to 
put extra data. Currently, this is used for extranonces, political or other 
short messages (such as in the Genesis block), miner "signatures", and also, 
as I mentioned, merged mining. Merged mining works by tying a non-
transactional merkle tree to the blockchain. The block coinbase stores the 
hash of the top of this merkle tree, so any data within the merkle tree can 
prove it is associated to the block. The merged mining merkle tree then stores 
hashes of multiple other data sets: for example, a Namecoin block can be 
referenced in a merged mining merkle tree, to use the Bitcoin block's proof-
of-work for itself (so, miners can mine both Bitcoin and Namecoin using the 
same hashing effort). You could also add other non-transactional blocks to the 
merged mining merkle tree, for generic timestamping or really anything at all.
