The write time for configuring a FPGA with a fresh bitstream is measured in
tens of milliseconds.


I have no objections to the use of FPGA or any other commercially available
hardware.

They make GPUs or FPGAs (as u mentioned) far more affordable.  The problem
is centralized manufacturing, which, in turn, is a side effect of a covert
hardware mining optimization leading to a monopoly.

A rotating POW seems to make ASIC manufacture impractical compared to
generalized, commercially available hardware.

It's too bad we can't make the POW somehow dynamic so that any specialized
hardware is impossible, and only GPU / FPGA is possible.
