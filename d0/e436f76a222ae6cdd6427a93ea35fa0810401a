Good morning Chaofan Li,

What enforces that bitcoin A is worth the same as bitcoin B?  Or are they allowed to eventually diverge in price?  If they diverge in price, how is that different from the current situation with Bitcoin, BCash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Hardfork-of-the-week, and so on?

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
