The actual example I was thinking of is that of traditional British
pubs.  Often a company will own several pubs - however the pubs
themselves will typically have individual traditional pub names.  The
name of the company might not be at all prominently advertised in the
pubs.

Traders at music festivals are another example that comes to mind (they
often accept credit cards if they sell higher value items so why not
Bitcoin?)  In this example there often are no clearly advertised
business names - at least, that the customer will be aware of.
