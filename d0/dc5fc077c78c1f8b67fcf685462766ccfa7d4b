Thus far you've claimed that these transactions would be "cheap", "[not]
controlled by miners", and "secure".

They would certainly not be cheap, because they are relatively more
expensive due to the extra depreciation cost.

I also doubt that they would be free of control by miners. 51% hashrate
can always filter out any message they want from anywhere.

For the same reason, I don't understand why they would be any more or
less secure.

So I think your way is just a more expensive way of accomplishing
basically the same result.

As I posted to bitcoin-discuss last week, I support UTXO commitments for
sidechains.

I don't think that blind merged mining messes with the main chain's
incentive structure. Miners are free to ignore the sidechain (and yet
still get paid the same as other miners), as are all mainchain users.
