I shamefully was not aware. However familiarized myself with them.

Non official chains suffer from the fact that few if any miners are going
to mine them so they lack security on par with the main chain. And more
over most users aren't going to use them because its not magic.

That being said think they are and will always be a great place to develop
and prove out concepts.

If my ultimate goal is official side chains that include part of the reward
such security is at parity between all chains and that the official
software automatically enable users to distribute their burden, would my
course of action be to build an external proof-of-concept side chain of
side chains?
or do you doubt that official reward splitting chains will ever find their
way into bitcoin core?
