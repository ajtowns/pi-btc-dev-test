Jim,

Most of those issues don't have to do with the SPV versus non-SPV problem.

First person doesn't understand what Bitcoin is supposed to do (he's
confusing mining and running a node). An information problem that could be
solved by explaining what is going on.

Another one seems to have a problem with DEP. That's probably an issue with
his OS configuration.

The third one is confused about the fees. Again, an information problem.

Only the fourth one is concerned with synchronization. The other ones could
happen with any client, as they're either based on misconceptions about
bitcoin as a whole or computer problems.

This doesn't in any way make switching to another, reduced security model
client preferable. Let's first try to improve the Bitcoin experience with
full security model, and if that somehow turns out to be impossible it's
always possible to recommend some other client based on the 'user type'.

I don't agree that this point is now. Anyway, security and stability of the
network is of utmost importance to do anything in the future, better to
grow organically than explode.

Many initiatives are underway to improve the Satoshi client (for example to
have Bitcoin-Qt behave as SPV client during initial block download, and as
full node after that), but as usual in open source development, many of us
are doing this basically for fun in our free time it does not always go as
fast as users would like.

I wish there was a straightforward solution for that, yeah pooling together
our development on one or two clients instead of a zillion different ones
could help, but everyone has more fun working on their own client that's
just how things go :)
