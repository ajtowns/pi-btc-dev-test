This is off-topic here.
Consensus critical changes (those aren't changes that Bitcoin Core
developers can make unilaterally against the will of alternative
implementations or users) and Bitcoin Core development are independent
from bitcointalk.org and /r/bitcoin.
And as you say, people can create competing without moderation or
"censorship" (ie /r/bitcoin_uncensored or bitcontalkuncensred.org
/r/bitcoin_moderated_by_someone_else ).
