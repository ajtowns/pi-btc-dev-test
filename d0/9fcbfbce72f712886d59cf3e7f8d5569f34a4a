The network protocol is not quite consensus critical, but it is important.

Two implementations of the decompressor might not be bug for bug
compatible.  This (potentially) means that a block could be designed that
won't decode properly for some version of the client but would work for
another.  This would fork the network.

A "raw" network library is unlikely to have the same problem.

Rather than just compress the stream, you could compress only block
messages only.  A new "cblock" message could be created that is a
compressed block.  This shouldn't reduce efficiency by much.

If a client fails to decode a cblock, then it can ask for the block to be
re-sent as a standard "block" message.

This means that it is a pure performance improvement.  If problems occur,
then the client can just switch back to uncompressed mode for that block.

You should look into the block relay system.  This gives a larger
improvement than simply compressing the stream.  The main benefit is
latency but it means that actual blocks don't have to be sent, so gives a
potential 50% compression ratio.  Normally, a node receives all the
transactions and then those transactions are included later in the block.
