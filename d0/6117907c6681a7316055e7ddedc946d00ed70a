Yeah, OK. Let's see how much progress Gary makes. Supporting HD wallets is
the trickiest part and I don't know how much time I will have - the Android
RNG issue and getting bcj 0.10 released have sucked up a lot of my time
lately and I need to refocus on other things for a bit. But between the guy
who volunteered to do payment protocol, and Gary doing TrezorJ, and Matija
already having done the core algorithms, I'm hoping the only parts I'll
have to do are integrating the HD code with the core wallet code. Possibly
if we're running out of time I can do a real basic HD wallet implementation
that only iterates a key once and doesn't generate new keys for each
transaction, as that's really the trickiest part (because of the need for
lookahead/behind and memory bloat on phones).
