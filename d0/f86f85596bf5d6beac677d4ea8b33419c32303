This isn't quite perfect because if there is only 1 P2PKH output and you
know the person is using the above algorithm then you know the P2PKH output
isn't the change.

I don't know what the perfect method is.  My guess is that it is to let p
be the probability that a P2PKH output is produced over the entire network
and to pick P2PKH for your change output with probability p (and similarly
for other output types).
