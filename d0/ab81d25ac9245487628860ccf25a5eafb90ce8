Isn't that sort of what this BIP describes as well? Except that we use the
scriptSig to transport the signatures internally to the transactions and
strip them when it comes to signing/checking? The wire format and transport
of transactions do not change so old clients continue to fetch and process
transactions as before, they just can't verify the TX. Blocks still
reference the instance but verification uses the stripped TX with the
signatures on the side, etc.
