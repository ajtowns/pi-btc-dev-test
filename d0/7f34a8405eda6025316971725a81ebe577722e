Aaron,

My understanding is that Gavin and Mike are proceeding with the XT fork, I
hope that understanding is wrong.

As for improving the non-consensus code to handle full blocks more
gracefully.  This is something I'm very interested in, block size increase
or not. Perhaps I shouldn't hijack this thread, but maybe there are others
who also believe this would ameliorate some of the time pressure for
deciding on a block size increase.

What is it that you would like to see improved?
The fee estimation code that is included for 0.11 will give much more
accurate fee estimates, which should allow adding the correct fee to a
transaction to see it likely to be confirmed in a reasonable time.  For
further improvements:
- There has recently been attention to overhauling the block creation and
mempool limiting code in such a way that actual outstanding queues to be
included in a block could also be incorporated in fee estimation.  See
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6281.
- CPFP and RBF are candidates for inclusion in core soon, both of which
could be integrated into transaction processing to handle the edge cases
where a priori fee estimation fails. See
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1647 and
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6176

I know there has been much discussion of fee estimation not working for SPV
clients, but I believe several independent servers which were serving the
estimates from full nodes would go a long way towards allowing that
information to be used by SPV clients even if its not a completely
decentralized solution.  See for example
http://core2.bitcoincore.org/smartfee/latest.json
