The main advantage of relative locktime over absolute locktime is in
situations when it is not possible to determine when the clock should
start.   This inherently means lower delays.

As a workaround, you could chain transactions to extend the relative
locktime.

Transaction B has to be 360 days after transaction A and then transaction C
has to be 360 days after transaction B and C must be an input into the
final transaction.

The chain could be built up with multi-sig, like the refund transaction
system, so no one person can create an alternative chain.
