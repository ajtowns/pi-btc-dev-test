Someone said to me that the cell phone apps they had tried were still
too slow. I'm still using an old phone so I didn't know well what to
answer him. I recomended him bitcoin wallet and bitcoin spinner, but I
warned him that I haven't really used them.

It would be nice to also have a list with smartphone clients near the
list that is being prepared.
