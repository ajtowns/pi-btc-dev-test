I am not sure if double spends can be resolved, at the moment they are not 
and I highly doubt you will see millions instant providers just like I don't 
see millions Certificate Authorities and I don't see Million Credit Card 
networks.

Any reason you think people will spread trust instead of consolidating of a 
bunch of instant transaction providers when time is critical?
