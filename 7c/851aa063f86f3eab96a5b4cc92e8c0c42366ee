Couldn't these services return a payment message instead of an address?

I agree that there is currently an UI issue here: there is no way in
current wallets to store a payment message and pay to it later. We
will need something like that for recurring payments as well.

Bitcoin addresses were never designed with extensibility in mind.
Before the payment protocol there have been lots of ideas to add
functionality to them, but the underlying idea that they have to be
handled by users manually means that they have to be as short as
possible, which is a conflicting aim with extensibility...
