To repeat, the very first point in my email reply was: "Agree that 7 tps is
too low"  Never was it said that bit

Therefore a reply arguing against the low end is nonsense, and the relevant
question remains on the table.

How high do you want to go - and can Layer 1 bitcoin really scale to get
there?

It is highly disappointing to see people endorse "moar bitcoin volume!"
with zero thinking behind that besides "adoption!"  Need to actually
project what bitcoin looks like at the desired levels, what network
resources are required to get to those levels -- including traffic to serve
those SPV clients via P2P -- and then work backwards from that to see who
can support it, and then work backwards to discern a maximum tps.
