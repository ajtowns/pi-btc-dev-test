Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposed new policy for transactions that depend
 on other unconfirmed transactions

I dont see any problem with such limits. Though, hell, if you limited
entire tx dependency trees (ie transactions and all required unconfirmed
transactions for them) to something like 10 txn, maximum two levels
deep, I also wouldnt have a problem.
