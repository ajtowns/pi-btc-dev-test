 Compression"

I would expect that since a block contains mostly hashes and crypto signatures,
it would be almost totally incompressible.  I just calculated compression ratios:

zlib    -15%    (file is LARGER)
gzip     28%
bzip2    25%

So zlib compression is right out.  How much is ~25% bandwidth savings worth to
people?  This seems not worth it to me.  :-/
