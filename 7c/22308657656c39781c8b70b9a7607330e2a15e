Transaction forwarding could be randomised slightly, by randomising the 
outgoing relay order; and adding a random delay between each forward.  Even 
the massively connected monitor can't represent _all_ the connections on every 
real node, so it would have no way of knowing whether it got any transaction 
from the originator or because it got a fast path through the first N nodes to 
receive it.
