Very cool, thanks Matt.

I was actually thinking this morning, maybe we should require all nodes to
go through the inv/getdata dance. Otherwise it's possible to improve your
chances at racing a block by mining a block, waiting to see a block inv
from another node, then blasting out your block while other nodes are still
waiting on their getdatas.
