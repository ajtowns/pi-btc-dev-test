No, that was a temporary branch of what became the stable 0.6.x branch.
GitHub/master is bleeding edge. For production, you usually want the stable 
branches/releases (which are on Gitorious).

The fix to -detachdb's position in -help was just merged to master, and should 
be backported sometime in the next few days.
