New 'standard' transaction forms would be perfect candidates for BEPS.

I think we aught to have a formal proposal to separate the protocol
version from the client version, too.

Does anybody besides me think maybe we should name them something
other than "BEP" ?

I'm worried we'll regret it in two years when a google for "BEP003"
takes you to the BitTorrent EPs instead of the BitCoin EPs.

Maybe "BIP" == Bitcoin Improvement Proposal
or "PEB" == Proposal to Enhance Bitcoin
or "BER" == Bitcoin Enhancement Request

I think I like "BIP"  (PEB sounds like a diet soda, and I don't know
if BER should be pronounced "bear" or "beer").

I generally don't care about names, but it seems like a little
planning now might save some confusion later. And I don't want the
BitTorrent folks to get pissed off at us for 'stealing' their acronym,
either.
