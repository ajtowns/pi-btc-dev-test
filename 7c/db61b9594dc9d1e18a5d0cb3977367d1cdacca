You can even update by visiting your fork (it creates this automatically and a topic branch) and make more edits and it will add to your PR. There is basically no barrier for non techy people to contribute.

Ooo, I like this. I *can* use git, but would love to be able to avoid it -- as would most non-technical contributors.

Anyway, this particular solution doesn't appear to be possible in this case, as the file isn't at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/0.9.0/doc/release-notes , and I don't believe I could copy it to the repository without going the whole git route. Suggestions welcome, here or privately.

The foolishness of sending a payment to a Mt. Gox-held wallet -- which is required to edit the wiki -- strikes me as a pressing issue. If I understand it correctly, this is a hard blocker that'll stop *all* new contributors. Further, I registered for the wiki and never got my confirmation email. Methinks the whole thing is broken. :(

Again, please to redirect me if this is inappropriate for this list. (I'm new here.) Cheers,
