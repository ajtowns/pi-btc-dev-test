I believe nearly everyone at Bitcoin Unlimited would be supportive of a UTXO check-pointing scheme.  I?d love to see this happen, as it would greatly reduce the time needed to get a new node up-and-running, for node operators who are comfortable trusting these commitments.  

I?m confident that we could work with the miners who we have good relationships with to start including the root hash of the (lagging) UTXO set in their coinbase transactions, in order to begin transforming this idea into reality.  We could also issue regular transactions from ?semi-trusted? addresses controlled by known people that include the same root hash in an OP_RETURN output, which would allow cross-checking against the miners? UTXO commitments, as part of this initial ?prototype? system.

This would "get the ball rolling" on UTXO commitments in a permissionless way (no one can stop us from doing this). If the results from this prototype commitment scheme were positive, then perhaps there would be support from the community and miners to enforce a new rule which requires the (lagging) root hashes be included in new blocks.  At that point, the UTXO commitment scheme is no longer a prototype but a trusted feature of the Bitcoin network.    

On that topic, are there any existing proposals detailing a canonical ordering of the UTXO set and a scheme to calculate the root hash?

Best regards,
Peter
