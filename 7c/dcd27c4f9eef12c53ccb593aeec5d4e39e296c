Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin Survey Paper
Message-ID: <55647AFB.3000909@informatik.hu-berlin.de>


Hi all,

some time ago, we became interested in Bitcoin, but gathering relevant
work and getting an overview was kind of painful. We took it as a sign
that a survey paper on Bitcoin is desperately needed.

Since then we observed the activities of the Bitcoin community. Recently
we finished a technical report that is our attempt to contribute the
lacking Bitcoin survey. Maybe it will be of interest to some of you:

Feedback is highly appreciated and would help to improve the quality of
future revisions.

Cheers, Florian.
