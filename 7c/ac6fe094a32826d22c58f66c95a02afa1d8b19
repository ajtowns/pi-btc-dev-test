The issue isn't that the licenses are different, it's that the OPL is
significantly more restrictive (with the additional clauses that you opted
into).

Indeed, using a different license for documentation is common advise, although
if the documentation also includes example code you may want to dual-license
the documentation with a code-oriented license as well if the documentation
license isn't maximally permissive.

Thanks, CC-BY-SA is a perfectly good license for that purpose.
