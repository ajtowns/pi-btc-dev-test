I think that the argument for Peter's optimal block construction algorithm
(leading to the definition of the Fee Demand Curve) is that in the limit of
a mempool with a very large number of transactions, you should be able to
assume that for any given transaction [image: i] of size [image: s_i] and
fee density [image: \phi_i], many transactions [image: j] will exist such
that [image: s_j<s_i] and [image: \phi_j=\phi_i]. This means that, in
solving the knapsack problem, one has the choice of including what
effectively amounts to fractions of transactions. This in turn results in
an unbounded knapsack problem for which Peter's greedy algorithm is an
asymptotically optimal solution.

Obviously this breaks down in small mempool scenarios where the
discreteness of transactions can not be washed away (such as the current
state of the network).

I hope this clarifies your point.

This was pointed out to me by Tom Harding.

Choosing what the optimal way of choosing transactions to be included in a
block is a knapsack problem (an NP-complete problem!):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem

For which your suggested solution, which is by no means exact, is known as
the "Greedy Approximation Algorithm". This algorithm in turn works best
only when a very large quantity of high density transactions is available
in the mempool.

This wouldn't invalidate your proof but it may significantly alter the
optimal block size value.

Just thought I would throw this your way.

Daniele --

Thanks!  I printed it and read the whole thing.  It's really a great step
forward building on the Peter R paper. The conclusions are enticing.  I'm
looking forward to understanding it in more detail and participating in the
discussion.

I find your work to be rational and scholarly without being obscure,
pedantic, or getting caught up in unimportant details.  It has a long-term
focus.


"The optimal strategy, ?rst analyzed in [3]"  I don't recall whether Peter
R considered constrained block space or not, but if it is considered,
simple fee-density prioritization is not necessarily optimal (it is a
knapsack problem).
