That's an interesting claim; so suppose you're living in a future where
transactions are summarizing millions or billions of other daily
transactions, possibly with merkle hashes. You think that because a user
can't individually broadcast his own personal transaction, that the user
would not be interested in verifying the presence of a summarizing
transaction in the blockchain? I'm just curious if you could elaborate on
this effect. Why would I need to see my individual transactions on the
network, but not see aggregate transactions that include my own?
