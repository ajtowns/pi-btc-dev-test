This is indeed a problem in the research community. Often ideas from here are 
just overlooked, and e.g., re-invented or not properly acknowledged. Of 
course, this is (in almost all cases) not intentionally. It's just difficult to 
keep track of everything.

Your paper is a definitely the right approach to bring the researchers closer 
to the Bitcoin community.

Best,
