Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Wallet related bug?
Message-ID: <CAD2Ti29zRc38K1DGfe=NC2PMZwCQs55LV1pkN4wuLntrgdchiw@mail.gmail.com>

I had previously commented on this.
My references to wallet ver were really to nFileVersion.
And I've since been able to make that, and the
real walletversion become current.

However it is still doing this every invocation...
 Rescanning last 14xxx blocks (from block 170xxx)...
Which seems unneeded more than 1x. I cannot yet explain.

So I expect to avoid all by send the balance from old
wallets to new wallet soon instead.

The old wallets were ver 10500.
