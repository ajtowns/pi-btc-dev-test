Hi Andreas

Thanks for bringing this up and this seems indeed to be suboptimal.

Bitcoin Core is not an identity that can be ?willing to extend? (or reject) a feature.
Someone needs to come up with a proposal (pull request).

Maybe an extension for BIP37 would make sense (*meh*).
Just inserting the witness data into the bloom filter seems to be an easy solution (CBloomFilter::IsRelevantAndUpdate())
