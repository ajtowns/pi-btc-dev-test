In multi-party protocols, the last person to sign knows what the total
weight is going to be (now that we have fixed sized signatures) and at
least they have the ability to sign it.  They are probably motivated to
sign the weight as long as they are interested in the success of the
transaction.  I suppose there could be asynchronous protocols where there
isn't a last person to sign, but that seems a bit weird.  Greg, you are
probably more familiar with examples of multi-party protocols than I am.

OTOH maybe the last person to sign isn't interested in the success of the
transaction and wants to cause grief by bloating the transaction and
signing the bloated weight.  I guess in such protocols, you'll have to keep
the anti-malleablity Script Code.

I totally get the idea that signing weight has a lot of issues in many
scenarios.  But I still feel than on the whole it is better to make the
option available than to be forced to rely on anti-malleability Script Code
or non-consensus relay policy.
