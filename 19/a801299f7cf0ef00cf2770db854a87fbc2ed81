Makes it trivial to find miners and DoS attack them - a huge risk to the
network as a whole, as well as the miners.

Right now pools already get DoSed all the time through their work
submission systems; getting DoS attacked via their nodes as well would
be a disaster.

That'd be an excellent way to double-spend merchants, significantly
increasing the chance that the double-spend would succeed as you only
have to get sufficient hashing power to get the lucky blocks; you don't
need enough hashing power to *also* ensure those blocks don't become the
longest chain, removing the need to sybil attack your target.
