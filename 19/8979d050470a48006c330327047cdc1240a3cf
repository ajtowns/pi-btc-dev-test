I actually was not aware that so many had already switched to mBTC.   I
guess it shows how much I use other wallets. 

You misunderstood my "consensus" comment.   I was simply stating the
"consensus" of debating on the mailing list endlessly is not as
effective as doing it.  Thus I was just going to do it and see who
follows.  But that also assumed there was not a critical mass who'd
already switched -- I must admit I'm not so confident anymore...

I am/so strongly opposed //to mBTC /compared to uBTC, I was ready to
take a small leap of faith (with associated risks), to help push the
"consensus".  Of course it would still remain configurable, but the
default will make a big difference.
