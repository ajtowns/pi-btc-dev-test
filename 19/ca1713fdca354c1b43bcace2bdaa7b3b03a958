This isn't implementation-specific. If you read it, you should notice it is 
intentionally generic for multiple use-cases. Right now bitcoind supports 
getmemorypool for a few use cases, but this proposed BIP enables it to be 
utilized for many more. Specifically, Eligius and at least a few other pools 
wish to move toward a more decentralized method of pooled mining (similar to 
the proprietary p2pool protocol). Eligius already supports miners producing 
their own work with getmemorypool using this draft, and our Eloipool server is 
open source (AGPL-3) for others to adopt (I know of at least one other pool 
planning to do so). Other pools not using Eloipool also have expressed 
interest in this, so a standard is desirable.
