I was just doing what was always done. In practice, the translations
follow a very different cycle than the rest of the code. Entering
translations as well as reviewing them happens inside Transifex.

Sure, someone could "maliciously change strings". It's typical that
this little bikeshedding topic attracts so much attention.

But if it makes all of you happy I won't do the translation update.
