Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Why is deriving public key from the signature not
 used in Segwit?

34 bytes in fact

I have asked already the question at least twice on this list pointing
out the fact that pubkey is there now even for standard p2pkh
transactions and it was not the case some time ago

But I never got any answer regarding what motivated this change
(compared to the previous behavior) and when, so whether I am missing
something obvious, whether nobody wants to answer

Txs without pubkey are now rejected then what is the element in the code
(protocol, version, etc) that "decided" this?
