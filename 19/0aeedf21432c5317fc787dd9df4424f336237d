I'm already volunteering. At least I don't get paid for my efforts in
debugging the seed infrastructure.

Can you verify if your copy of the seeder contains the commit
8dcc006e6256cb746c2b025daf3df41baa26353e ?

It fixed a bug that has exactly the symptoms we currently see.

I wonder if the restart of your server actually changed/fixed
anything. If you got a SERVFAIL this may be because you were traveling
through parts of the world that can't reach your server. Did you
actually try at home, before the restart?
