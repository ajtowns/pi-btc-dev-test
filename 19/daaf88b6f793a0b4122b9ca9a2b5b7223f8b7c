Why should they have to?  Joining the network as a node is very low cost to 
the other nodes.  You can't force any node not to be lazy, since their option 
is to disconnect themselves.  As to maliciousness, that is defended against 
because when a node negative announces a transaction, that transaction is 
going to be checked (note that there is still no implicit trust) -- if a node 
is incorrectly negative-announcing then it can justifiably be kicked.

Me too.  It's important though to distinguish between "you must be verifying" 
and "if you do verify, you must be honest about it".  No node should be forced 
to do any work it doesn't want to; but they should be forced to be truthful 
about the work they choose to do.
