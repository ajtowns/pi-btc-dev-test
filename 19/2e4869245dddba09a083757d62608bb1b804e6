I think this is not relevant: By paying the same amount you can delay
the same transactions today.

The difference is that your 'attack' wastes less capacity-- it can be
a simple 150 weight txn rather than a collection that add up to almost
4 million weight; but it costs exactly the same.  To the extent that
this difference matters at all, I think it's an improvement.

The only argument that I see for it not being one is that it's easier
to do accidentally.  But part of the purpose of this alternative
market is to achieve an equilibrium other than the ultrabloating one;
so yes, you're going to find outcomes where the blocks are not
maximally full.

I wonder how the economics would respond if there is a PI controller
on the maximum size, so that 'lost space' in single blocks with bogon
fee transactions could be recovered if doing so didn't change the
medium timescale total. I think the paper's analysis assumes there is
no limit, but that is impractical for technical reasons (e.g. making
it impossible to budget communications and storage capacity for
nodes...).
