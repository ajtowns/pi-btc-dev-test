If bit had to be preceded by a letter I would nominate "ebit" or "xbit" (which could still be XBT)

Those needing a definition for x could define it as "coin/1000000".

That said, I am still more in favor of "bit". Xbit would just solve the problems others cite about ambiguity if they had to be solved without the resulting name being too long.

Something tells me this would be reduced to a single syllable in common usage I.e. bit.

My 2 cents goes for "bit".

Because: Bitcoin is a digital currency, BTC starts with "bit", "bit" refers to a small amount of something in its regular english usage and lastly 99.9876543% of people on the planet don't know what a digital "bit" is yet ...

My impression:

Good because it is short, memorable, and pronounceable by speakers of most languages (though to most of the world that would be oo-bit, as "u" being "yu" is mostly an English thing)

Downsides include the fact that ? is not a U, it just resembles one. It is a lowercase M in Greek, a live spoken language also studied by many, and calling it a U conveys a notion of global unawareness. And the potential for "XBT" to be 1e-6 BTC on the world stage would be huge, worth pursuing.

What about "ubit", pronounced "YOU-bit", representing 1e-6 bitcoin? Easy to say, tied in a visual way to the metric micro, leaves the required 2 decimal places for the marginally numerate.. What more could one want?

Also, hi. My first post; plan to get involved over the southern hemisphere winter if I can learn enough.

By culturally neutral I mean we avoid deliberately invoking a cultural reference in the name.  For example "satoshi" would be a reference to Japanese culture just for being a common Japanese name regardless of who Satoshi turns out to be.
