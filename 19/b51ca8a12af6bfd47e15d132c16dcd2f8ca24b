No! I'm proposing that we force everyone to do it. Using all means
necessary. There should be regular audits that everyone is running the
software exactly in my configuration, and if not, a special task force will
take care that spankings are carried out on the spot.

Repeated offenders will lose their BitLicense.

Please stop kicking this dead horse. It was just a random idea. Maybe a way
how Linux distributions could structure it, but it may or may not apply in
your case. And that's fine, this is free software development, you can do
whatever you want!

Let's try to bring this discussion back to its original intention: for
anyone that wants to concretely help this along, please help reviewing and
testing the pull requests that jgarzik mentions.

BTW: All of those patches are helpful for monolithic-bitcoind as well as
they (lay the groundwork for) speeding up block synchronization.
