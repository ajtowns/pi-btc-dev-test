Thanks for pointing this out.  I guess 51% is mainly of psychological
significance.

Totally see the logic of this, and it makes sense.  But I dont think the
only risk is in terms of double spend, but rather

1) vandalize the block chain which may be difficult to unwind?
2) use an attack to manipulate the price downwards, then rebuy lower

As bitcoin's market cap grows, incentives to move the market will grow

I guess the market will decide which algorithm is used, but as a community
we can perhaps review the different mining protocols and order them in
terms of risk ...
