The borrowing rates you're talking about involve the risk of default.

In lightning the hubs funds are not at risk so long as they maintain
control of the private keys.

The rates charged by hubs will almost certainly be orders of magnitude
below the rates charged on the various p2p lending sites....

But that seems fairly obvious... did I miss something?
