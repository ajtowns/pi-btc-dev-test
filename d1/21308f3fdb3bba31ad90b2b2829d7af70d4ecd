That's what my proposal was for, in BIP 0010:

https://github.com/genjix/bips/blob/master/bip-0010.md

However, I just found a minor problem with it that should be addressed 
if we want to enable super-lightweight clients that only sign tx's 
without needing the blockchain.  Simply that the TxIns don't contain the 
value of the TxOuts they are spending, which means the dumb tx-signers 
with no blockchain can't tell how much input there is.  They can only 
see the output values and recipients, which means they can't figure out 
the tx fee, or how much money is in each of the TxIns they are signing.

And most users/clients will have access to the blockchain, so it's not a 
dealbreaker.  But it's something to consider.  Otherwise, I think this 
is a big step towards bringing this complicatedprotocol a little closer 
to Earth...
