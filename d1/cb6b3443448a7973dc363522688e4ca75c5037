I think it would only save ~5% with all overhead (value, sequence,  
locktime, version, etc.) counted

A better way is to introduce shorter ECDSA keys, which will save a lot  
of space for public key and signature. It is safe as long as the  
output value is much lower than the cost of attack.

If this happens, I think it will be part of the OP_MAST which will  
require a new address type anyway.
