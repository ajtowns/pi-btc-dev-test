These are all valid points.  I hadn't really thought much about this point
until you all just brought it up.  The reason I so quickly spout off that
phrase, is that I endlessly get requests from Armory users to implement
more anonymity-based features.  When I say there are bigger priorities,
they suggest that "anonymity" is a core benefit of Bitcoin and I should be
supporting it.  I'm not against anonymity, and I most certainly favor
privacy, but my goal was to produce a versatile client, not one focused on
any one aspect -- there are plenty of people who use it for other reasons
than anonymity.

However, I do like Greg's comment about "attacks" against a
blind-dust-inclusion algorithm, and suggestion to maintain a clustering of
already-linked addresses.  That's not terribly difficult to do with the
transaction history in hand, and it could increase how often the logic
triggers.  I suppose these hardcore SD players probably have a lot of
one-satoshi outputs that could use vacuuming...
