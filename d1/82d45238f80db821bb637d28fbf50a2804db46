I really don't understand this either/or mentality.

OF COURSE we're going to raise the block size limit. Limiting the main
blockchain to single-digit transactions-per-second is not an option,
the vision FOREVER has been to scale it up.

And OF COURSE there will be off-chain transactions-- at the very
least, we need them for "instantly confirmed" transactions.

But lets table that whole discussion until 0.8.1 is out the door.
