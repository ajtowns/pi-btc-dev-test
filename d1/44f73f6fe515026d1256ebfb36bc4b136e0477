I'm somewhat curious what the authors envisioned the real-world implications of this model to be. While blindly asking users to enter what they're willing to pay always works in theory, I'd imagine in such a world the fee selection UX would be similar to what it is today - users are provided a list of options with feerates and expected confirmation times from which to select. Indeed, in a world where users pay a lower fee if they paid more than necessary fee estimation could be more willing to overshoot and the UX around RBF and CPFP could be simplified greatly, but I'm not actually convinced that it would result in higher overall mining revenue.

The UX issues with RBF and CPFP, not to mention the UX issues involved in optimizing for quick confirmation are, indeed, quite significant, but I believe them to be solveable with rather striaght-forward changes. Making the market more useable (for higher or lower overall miner revenue) may be a sufficient goal, however, to want to consider something like this.
