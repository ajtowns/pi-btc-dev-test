Yes there are similarities but also some important differences.  See my 
response here: 
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/012085.html

In short my proposal is compatible with conventional blocksize limit 
hardfork ideas, like BIP101, BIP202, 2-4-8 etc. etc.

That's the whole point.  After a conventional hardfork everyone needs to 
upgrade, but there is no way to force users to upgrade.  A user who is 
simply unaware of the fork, or disagrees with the fork, uses the old 
client and the currency splits.

Under this proposal old clients effectively enter "zombie" mode, forcing 
users to upgrade.
