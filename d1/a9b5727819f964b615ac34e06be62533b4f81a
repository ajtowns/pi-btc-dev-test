Why would you care about payments to other people?
The scriptPubKey's that you give to your payers certainly have meaning to you.

What is it important that you are able to calculate balances of
wallets that aren't yours?

Why would anyone "pay you" to a scriptPubKey you don't understand?

I can "pay" the bill of my internet services by burying cash in a park
nearby my house for my provider to pick up later.
But if I don't tell my provider, it will never know. If I inform it, I
will get an answer: "no, sorry, we won't accept this new 'form of
payment' of yours as payment".
