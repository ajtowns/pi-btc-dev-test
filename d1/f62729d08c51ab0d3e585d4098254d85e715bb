Subject: [Bitcoin-development] What's what with addr relaying?
Message-ID: <904753900.2475114.1424345591935.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

 Hi, plugging away at my C# Bitcoin node "Lego.NET" Thashiznets/Lego.NET now I am currently working on addr relaying. I am as we speak wiring up my DB in Azure, and ready to start plopping net_addrs in my DB, all good however I'm reading two different specification docs that seem to be wildly varying. I mean the first one here Developer Reference - Bitcoin?didn't mention that version message now has the 4 byte checksum and no?time in the net_addrs?and I was getting reject malformed?messages until I found the other document which informed me we now use the 4 byte checksum in version and no time in the net-addrs in version message. So?I solved that and here is the other doco. I have found other variances like one document said that the heartbeat AND disconnect were 30 minutes, but then in the other document I read that Heartbeat is 30 minutes and disconnect is 90 minutes which seems far more sensible so I went with that and modified my code. Is there any other variations between these two spec docos?that perhaps some of you devs know about that I need to look out for! Thanks! Shizzle.
