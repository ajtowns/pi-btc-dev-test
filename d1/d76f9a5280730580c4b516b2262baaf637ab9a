Please use GitHub pull requests (or at least publish a git repository) rather 
than mailing patches..

I'd suggest two commits for this:
1. Move the recommended fee outside the translatable string (bonus points to 
format it using the user's preferred unit)
2. Change the recommended fee in one place

Whether the recommended fee *should* be changed or not, I have no opinion on.
Eligius uses a lower minimum fee, but I believe most pools/miners will treat 
anything under 0.01 BTC as if it were no fee at all...
