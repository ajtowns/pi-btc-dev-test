Luke, it seems like the amendments to BIP8 make it drastically different to
how it first was designed to work.
It now looks more akin to BIP148, which was AFAICT not how BIP8 was
originally intended to work.
Perhaps this should be made into its own BIP instead, or make it so it's
possible to decide how the LOCKED_IN state should work when designing the
softfork.
