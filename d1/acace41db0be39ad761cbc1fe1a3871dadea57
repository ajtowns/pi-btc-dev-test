- It is true that hard forks produce a much cleaner outcome, in terms of
well defined behavior across the entire network.

- Replacing an opcode should not result in undefined behavior.  The
non-upgraded behavior is defined and deterministic.

- IsStandard remains an assistant.  Miners may mine non-standard
transactions.

- "Hard forks require everyone to upgrade and soft forks don't"   Doesn't
require tons of explanation:  Non upgraded clients continue working on the
network even after the rules are upgraded.

All those corrections aside, I do think there has been too much hysteria
surrounding hard forks.  Hard forks, when done right, produce a much
cleaner system for users.
