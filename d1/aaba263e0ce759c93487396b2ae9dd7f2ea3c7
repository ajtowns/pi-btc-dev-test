You are right, that's what I have been saying for online services that
ask for private keys, and even the seeds

The problem is that people can't refrain to put their keys for example
to get "free" coins, typically they try to use bitcoin-transactions,
don't succeed and go put their seeds in an online service

At least it gives an alternative, private keys are optional and the tool
will output the command to use with bitcoin-transactions, and if they
want to put directly their keys, then...

"Move your coins by yourself" refers more to "don't get trapped by your
wallet(s) or things that you don't master like multisig, segwit, bech32,
etc"

As I said the idea would be to end up with an offline tool should some
people support/finance the effort
