Hi, Mark.

We were asked on the bitcoin-documentation mailing list about a month

request for the Bitcoin.org website.  There's a preview here:

    http://dg0.dtrt.org/en/mining#lucky-attack

(Remember, it's a preview and still being actively written/edited.)

Discussion about that doc belongs on the bitcoin-documentation mailing
list. Here's the particular thread:

Thanks,
