Two quotes satoshi:

"Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset
doesn't scale."

and

"I like Hal Finney's idea for user-friendly timestamping.  Convert the hash
of a file to a bitcoin address and send 0.01 to it"

This leads me to believe, that while bitcoin should not be over used as a
time stamp server, there could be a balance reached for casual time stamp
recording as part of satoshi's concept.

What we call "spam" is to a degree subjective, and I think not always
obvious, tho in some cases it clearly is.
