Mutual CHAP could work.  This is commonly done in PPP and iSCSI.  The idea is simply that both sides authenticate.  The server expects the client to provide a password, and the client expects the server to provide a (different) password.  If you masquerade as the server, you won't be able to authenticate because every client has a different password they expect from the server, so they won't do work for you. MITM on the server can capture the exchange but CHAP protects against replay.
