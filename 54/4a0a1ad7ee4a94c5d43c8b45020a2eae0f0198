Yes, it is true that you can't do a soft-fork, but you can do a hard-fork.
Using scheduled updates: client simply stops working at a certain block,
and user is required to download an update.

You assume that an ability to operate with zero maintenance is very
important, but is this a case?

There was a plenty of critical bugs in bitcoind, and in many cases people
were strongly encouraged to upgrade to a new version.
So, you urge people to keep their clients up-to-date, but at the same time
claim that keeping very old versions is critically important.
How does this make sense? Is this an exercise at double-think?

An alternative to this is to make updates mandatory. You will no longer
need to maintain compatibility with version 0.1 (which is impossible) and
you can also evolve consensus rules over time.

It looks like people make a cargo cult out of Bitcoin's emergent
properties.
