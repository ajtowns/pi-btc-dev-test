While there is an agreement that a standard would be useful for sharing
wallets, we certainly didn't agree on every aspect of a standard. At
least not on this thread, and also not at the Berlin meeting.

I understand each client will implement things a little bit different,
for example the current plan is bitcoinj will hold all keys in memory
and start reusing keys on low resources. Electrum uses a chain for their
private purpose. Etc.

If we cannot 100% agree on a standard and also agree it will not be
extended in future, I think we should not even try. It's dangerous for
the money of users.

I propose we keep our chains deliberately separate and only try
standardizing after each of us has a feel for the specific requirements.
