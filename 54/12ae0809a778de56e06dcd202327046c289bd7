Hello,

Excellent news that segregated witness is nearing release for the mainnet.

I know I don't only speak for myself in saying that this has been
eagerly awaited for some time.

For the timing, I'd support segwit being usable on the network as soon
as is technically and safely possible.

We at JoinMarket are very interested in eventually using schnorr which
would allow signature aggregation and so reduce the cost of coinjoins.
