Tomorrow, I'll work on writing a way to do voting on proposals with BTC
used as voting shares (This will be difficult as I do not know FORTH).
That seems like a fairly simple, useful example that will require loops and
reused functions.  I'll add a fee that goes to the creator.

IMO, if you write a complicated system of scripts that's used frequently,
it makes sense to charge a fee for its usage.  A decentralized exchange
between colored coins, for instance might take a small fee on each trade.

I don't understand what you mean by "a function" in this context, I assume
you mean a scriptSig, but then "paying its creator" doesn't make much sense
to me .

Could you provide some high level examples of the use cases you would like
to support with this?
