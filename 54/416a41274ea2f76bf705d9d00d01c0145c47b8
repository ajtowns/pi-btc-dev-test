Thanks Jan, we added several additional checks for non-standard protocol
responses, and also made the client revert to DNS seeding more quickly if
it runs into trouble, so it's now more robust against sybil/DOS attack. I
mentioned in the coindesk article that I didn't think what your nodes were
doing was intended to be malicious with respect to network disruption. It's
our job to better handle non-standard or even malicious behavior from
random p2p nodes.
