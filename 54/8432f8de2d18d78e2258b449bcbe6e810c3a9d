In what universe is that simple? Your solution: browser extension +
wallet + comminucation API + all the wallets need to implement it
Our solution: just browser extension.

If you hate writing browser extensions in Javascript, you can say it
directly. ;)

Just no.

This looks more interesting but is information about your location
really so secret that you need to hold it in HW wallet? Because if so,
you probably don't want to use untrusted machine anyway. (Or just use
Qubes OS.)
