Isn't this all backward? The "authority" component of the URL should identify the chain, and the "path" component should identify the particular block, tx, or address in that chain.

So instead of:

blockchain://tx/ca26cedeb9cbc94e030891578e0d2b688a28902114f6ad2f24ecd3918f76c17f?chain=000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f

It should be:

blockchain://000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f/tx/ca26cedeb9cbc94e030891578e0d2b688a28902114f6ad2f24ecd3918f76c17f

And I would agree with allowing well-known chains to register a name, to be used as an alternative to the literal, hash syntax:

blockchain://bitcoin/tx/ca26cedeb9cbc94e030891578e0d2b688a28902114f6ad2f24ecd3918f76c17f
