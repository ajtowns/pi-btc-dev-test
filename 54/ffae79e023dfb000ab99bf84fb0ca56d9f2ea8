It isn't useful for actually using the feature, but some miners might set
the bit but not actually create blocks that comply with the new rule.

This would cause their blocks to be orphaned until they fixed it.

OK, *that* variant makes perfect sense, and is no more complex, AFAICT.

It could be more than two weeks if the support stays between 80% and 90%
for a while.

75%+ checks that blocks with the bit set follow the rule.

95%+ enters lock-in and has the same rules as 75%+, but is irreversible at
that point.

I meant if the 2nd bit was part of the BIP.  One of the 2 bits is "FOR" and
the other is "AGAINST".  If against hits 25%, then it is deemed a failure.

The 2nd bit wouldn't be used normally.  This means that proposals can be
killed quickly if they are obviously going to fail.
