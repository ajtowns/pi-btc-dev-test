As I showed with my zerocoin example, often that is not the case, e.g. I
do not support anonymity, or *can't* support it because of the local
laws.

Or for that matter, really boring examples like there's two competing
implementations of some basic idea and we'd rather the winner be picked
on technical merits rather than "I have a grudge and a small pool so
I'll this upstart at birth"

It's a thought experiment; read my original post on how to make a
zerocoin alt-chain and it might make more sense:

http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net/msg02472.html

Even better might be to use a merge-mined version of Mastercoin as an
example, where the initial distribution of coins is fixed at genesis and
forward from that is independent of the Bitcoin blockchain.

I'll give you a hint: "marginal cost"

You're rant has rather little to do with my argument.
