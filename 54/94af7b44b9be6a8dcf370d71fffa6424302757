The point of that case is that there aren't such miners, so that exploit
doesn't apply.

In particular, AIUI, you'll have a hard job right now finding someone to
mine an OP_NOP2 transaction -- eligius might do it, but I don't think many
others will. And you also need your currently OP_NOP2-friendly miner not
to upgrade to an OP_CLTV-validating codebase, so I don't think eligius
will qualify there.

If you want XOR, you'd need something more like:

 OP_IF OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubkeyhash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY
 OP_ELSE <locktime> OP_CLTV
 OP_ENDIF

But that' still fail IsStandard and DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS checks
if you tried spending without a valid sig, so wouldn't be mined by
current nodes. (Not having a sig would also allow anyone to spend it to
themselves, so that might make it hard to use as a basis for double
spends anyway...)

Cheers,
