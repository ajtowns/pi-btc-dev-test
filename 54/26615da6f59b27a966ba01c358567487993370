Yep, that is a possibility. The blinding factor could be encrypted
with the public key of the receiver. Thus it is only visible for the
receiver who can then check that the correct amount has been sent.

I understand and agree.

Here you lost me.
Why do we need to create a shared secret? Is this shared secret used
as the blinding factor?
Also I think the sender knows the unhashed public key of the receiver.
The only reason not to include it in the transaction script is that an
external observer is unable to see the receiver directly in the
blockchain.
