It's possible that the enigmail extension is not working right, but I 
was under the impression that it is just feeding data to gpg and then 
receiving the response back. It's possible that your e-mail you just 
checked was not sent through mailman since I also replied directly to 
you explicitly (in which case the message has not been modified) and you 
probably have the setting in the mailing list set to not send duplicate 
messages if you are an explicit TO. I just deleted all explicit TOs for 
this message, so everyone should be receiving it through the mailing 
list and not directly. Is the signature still valid for you now? I think 
enigmail can handle messages with some signed and unsigned content, and 
maybe PGP/MIME inherently does not support this and a mailing list 
re-writing parts of messages is an expected action? If this message 
re-writing is an expected action and I'm correct that PGP/MIME does not 
support partially signed content, then maybe it is just a recommendation 
for this mailing list to not use PGP/MIME for messages sent to the list?

Can anyone else confirm?
