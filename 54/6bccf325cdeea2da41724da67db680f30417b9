The goal is to have an opportunity cost to breaking the rules.

Proof of Burn is a real cost for following the rules.

With Bitcoin we now have a scarce resource within the digital realm, so it appeals my intuition to re-use it for sacrifice instead of linking again an external, real world resource.

To also introduce a lottery, the burn transaction?s hash is required to satisfy some function of the block hash it was included in on the Bitcoin block chain. For example modulo m of the burn transaction hash must match modulo m of the block hash, that is not known in advance.

Should he burn transaction be included into the Bitcoin block chain and the Bitcoin block?s hash satisfy the lottery criteria, then the block candidate can be submitted to extend the side chain.

Bitcoin miner can not selectively block side chains since the hashes associated with the burn do not disclose which side chain or other project they are for. Here you have a ?merged mining? that does not need Bitcoin miner support or even consent.
