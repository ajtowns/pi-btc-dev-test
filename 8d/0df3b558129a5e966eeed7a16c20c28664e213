Some more information on testnet3 explorers ...

Here is a free software testnet explorer based on javascript/node

http://test.bitcore.io/

I've been working on a testnet explorer, but I think I will fork this and
add semantic web style markup attributes to the HTML.

Also a message I got from blockr.io "yes testnet will be added. I cannot
give you an estimate on when, but it'll probably happen in couple of weeks
(hopefully sooner)."
