tl;dr
$100 worth of hardware and $1/mo of expenses, should be able to run a full
Bitcoin node until 2020 with BIP101-size blocks.

----

I got into Bitcoin in the summer of 2010. I'm not a cryptographer, up until
recently my profession has been as a server administrator or systems
engineer.

I'd like to take a second to address the concern that larger blocks would
make it harder to run a full node on limited hardware and would therefore
hurt decentralization. I run two nodes today, one on server-grade hardware
at a datacenter and another on a mini-ITX Atom (dual core) system at my
home.

I detailed the operational costs of my home node today on reddit:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3f0h8e/mike_h_shuts_down_eric_ls_attempt_to_rewrite/ctkigpr

If I was a new user, wanting to run a full node. The most cost effective
way would likely be with a Raspberry Pi 2 and a 2TB external HDD. Total
cost about $100, including charger, microSD card, etc. That is less than
the cost of a TREZOR hardware wallet. As far as home projects go, not
terribly expensive.

Next, it will need power. According to the Wikipedia article, the rpi 2
model B uses 3.5 watts of power max. The 2TB external drive will draw about
5 watts at max. That's a total of 8.5 watts or 6.205 Kwh per month. In my
area (North Texas) power is about $0.10/Kwh, which means my little node
costs $0.62 per month in power.

Last, lets look at bandwidth. It's difficult to quantify bandwidth cost in
the same way because this is a home connection, mainly because I don't know
how to price in the loss of enjoyment if the system impacts my Internet
usage to a noticeable degree. Luckily, I have some real world data from my
existing home node. Here is the last month:
http://imgur.com/YmJwQpN

This system averages 120 Kbps in and 544 Kbps out. Note, this data is
somewhat skewed, because the system is also used for seeding torrents of
various open source projects. The Bitcoin node itself is typically
connected to about 20 peers at any given time (maxconnections=20).

Subjectively, my wife and I have never noticed any degradation of
performance due to my home server using too much bandwidth. I think it's
safe to say that I can treat the bandwidth is uses as effectively free,
since it's piggybacking on a connection I would be paying for even if I was
not running a Bitcoin node. The bandwidth usage of this Bitcoin node could
increase significantly, without any noticeable impact. If it did, I could
always lower maxconnections back to 8.

The only real constraint seems to be hard drive space, as the full
blockchain and indexes take up about 50GB of space currently. If BIP101 is
implemented, 2TB of storage should be enough for me to continue running my
hypothetical $100 node until about 2020.

It seems to me that at least for the next 5 years, the "small devices" of
today can easily run Bitcoin nodes with BIP101-size blocks, with very
little operational cost.

If anyone would like more detailed data on my existing nodes, please let me
know and I'll attempt to provide it (so long as it doesn't impact my
privacy of course).
