Note that this would compound the privacy leak that Jonas Nick used to
identify address clusters via the bloom filters in one of his publications.
By reducing the false positives when matching you can get very detailed
clusters. Then again we know that bloom filters aren't good for privacy
anyway, so this might be a non-issue.
