Mempool transactions have their place, but "unconfirmed" and "SPV" don't
belong together.  Only a full node can tell if a transaction may get
confirmed, or is nonsense.  Unfortunately all the light / SPV wallets I
know of show mempool transactions, which makes it hard to go back... (e.g.
"why doesn't your software show 0-conf! your wallet is broken!", somewhat
akin to people complaining about RBF)

So, this is easy, just don't worry about mempool filtering.  Why are light
clients looking at the mempool anyway?  Maybe if there were some way to
provide SPV proofs of all inputs, but that's a bit of a mess for full nodes
to do.

Without mempool filtering, I think the committed bloom filters would be a
great improvement over the current bloom filter setup, especially for
lightning network use cases (with lightning, not finding out about a
transaction can make you lose money).  I want to work on it and may be able
to at some point as it's somewhat related to lightning.

Also, if you're running a light client, and storing the filters the way you
store block headers, there's really no reason to go all the way back to
height 0.  You can start grabbing headers at some point a while ago, before
your set of keys was generated.  I think it'd be very worth it even with
GB-scale disk usage.
