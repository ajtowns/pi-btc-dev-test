Although the planning for this a bit far along now, one consideration I
might add from experience on working with other transglobal IT projects
is the effect of timezones on local mood/alertness/awareness etc. The
guys at 9am pinging on their first coffee in the antipodes will be in a
different mindset than those at 21:00 in Europe, and this is
unavoidable. What is possible is to schedule the meeting every other
week at a time that is better for the "other" half, whoever that might
be. This comes at the cost of not having an exactly same time set every
week.

It's true that this can make a convenient time less convenient half of the year, for some people, but I don't think there's a time that works for everyone anyway...
