Hi,

Sorry for the delay, I overlooked this email until now. I see that Chris
and CryptAxe both answered but I will also answer, because the message
was addressed to me.

If I've understood you correctly, you have said that each OP Return
links the (ex)-latest block to a brand new block, and that whichever
message of this kind comes first (in the mainchain) wins and the rest
are discarded.

So what if I had a sidechain represented by a jumble of capital letters,
discarded entries as lowercase letters.

Mainchain Block #200001:  [0 --> Q], [0 -->v], [0 -->s], [0 -->b],
Mainchain Block #200002:  [Q --> H], [Q --> z],
Mainchain Block #200003:  [H --> F]
Mainchain Block #200004:  [F --> J], [F -->w]
Mainchain Block #200005:  [H --> P], [J -->x]
Mainchain Block #200006:  [P --> D]

Isn't the chain {{ Q --> H --> F --> J  }} now starting to reorg, with a
competing chain {{ Q --> H --> P --> D  }} ?

What I do want to do, is retain the existing model to some extent.
Specifically, to the degree where sidechains could salvage some bad
situations (eg value overflow incident, or March 2013 incident).

That is a good point. Technically, we do include it twice, but the
second instance (briber-transaction) can be "shuffled" out if the
counterparties are part of the same Lightning Network (which I expect to
the be the case, in equilibrium).

No, sorry. There are many tangled issues (Drivechain (total system);
side-to-main withdrawals (OP CountACKs); individual Drivechains
themselves; Blind Merged Mining (OP BribeVerify)). The ratchet is not
about withdrawals, it is exclusively about Blind Merged Mining, and
making a better OP BribeVerify that offers better guarantees to both sides.
