You clearly indicated that node count is an indicator of how hard it is to run 
a node.
Thats like saying something is too expensive because we don't sell enough. It 
forgets to ask the question of need. Do people want it.

Like in our case the need to run a node in the first place.

And you do the same thing again; you dismiss the need factor.

Most merchants have no need for a node, most miners don't even want to run one 
anymore. Users don't make a significant amount of payments to care.

Any conclusions with regards to difficulty of running a node based on max-
blocksize is speculation without numbers; the only numbers you have is 
historical node count, and they don't mean shit because the need has not 
grown.
For instance, merchants are told to trust someone like bitpay.


Historical node-count says nothing. Anyone using it for the blocksize debate 
is speculating without basis.
