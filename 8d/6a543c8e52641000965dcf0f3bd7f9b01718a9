Well, I meant "the probability of  your block being the hardest".
What a miner can do is hash the block (cheating the timestamp) for 2
more minutes than the rest of the people and then send it to the other
nodes. Nodes cannot possibly know when did you hashed the block only
by looking at their clock when they receive it, because there's also
network latency.

1) This is part of the satoshi client but not the protocol. A miner
can rewrite this part of the code and there won't be anything in the
chain that contradicts the protocol.

2) I haven't read the code but I'm pretty sure that's not a perfect
decentralized clock.

I will be more specific. Where's the network clock in the chain (in
the protocol)?
