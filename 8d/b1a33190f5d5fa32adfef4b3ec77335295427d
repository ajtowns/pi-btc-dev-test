I'm not arguing that it changes that; I'm arguing that it further confuses the
situation.

I think you're assuming that the users paying for soft-fork signalling will
represent an economic majority; that's not necessarily the case.

For example, if miners decide there's no downside to false signalling, they may
take the extra fees provided by 1% of the users paying to signal a fork, while
the other 99% don't participate, resulting in a situation where we have blocks
violating the nVersion protocol, and an unknown % of that 99% rejecting those
blocks. At best that'd be no worse than a UASF, and at wost you're wrecked the
validity of the nVersion "gentlemans agreement"

Just read it: you have ten separate lines of dense English text describing
something that could have been specified instead by ten lines of much more
formally defined C++. In particular, note how many of those lines of English
text refer to C++ code anyway, like the sentence "minimal-length 40-bit
CScriptNum"

I don't want to have to learn another language - formally defined English that
still fails to be formally defined - just to read Bitcoin's specification.
