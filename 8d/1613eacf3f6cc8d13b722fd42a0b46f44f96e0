Do you think this puts unnecessary trust into a third party?  If the 
merchant instead signed and agreed to the unsigned transactions before 
they were broadcast (as in my OP), these arbitration concerns disappear.

HTTP isn't the only message delivery mechanism.  Merchants can also lie: 
reply with 200 OK and an empty body.  Or, reply with 404 not found and 
broadcast transactions anyway.
