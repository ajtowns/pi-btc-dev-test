Doing a second soft-fork from 50% to 75% sounds more difficult since
that's going from a more restrictive ruleset to less restrictive, you
might be able to hack around it but it wouldn't be a fully backwards
compatible change like going from 75% to 50% would be. 50% vs 75% does
affect max transactions/second in practice, the exact amount depends
on the real world usage of course though.
