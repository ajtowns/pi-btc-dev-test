How about research projects into node distribution? Specifically I
wonder whether the collection and analysis of DNS query origin is
allowed when queries are anonymized and aggregated. This would prevent
the identification of a single user, which I assume is the rationale
for point 4.

Other than that I'm perfectly fine with accepting the rules for
seed.bitcoinstats.com

Christian
