This must be a new use of the word "abuse" I haven't come across before :)

At any rate, some of these assumptions are incorrect. Botnets of
compromised web servers are quite common, and asymmetry in node resources
is obviously biased against the kinds of devices people increasingly have
(phones, tablets) where extremely limited memory bandwidth is common and
apps routinely have just 16 or 32mb of memory to do everything including
the GUI.

A good anti-DoS strategy looks much the same as a good load shedding
strategy. There's little reason to treat them separately. Perhaps instead
of talking about DoS we should instead talk about what happens if Bitcoin
suddenly gets too popular. Now there are suddenly lots of good users all
wanting to use the network, and not enough nodes to support them all. What
do we do?

Some rules seem obvious - try to prioritise existing users over new users,
old coins over new coins (dPriority already does this) etc. If you run out
of TCP sockets prefer to disconnect recent connections (probably new users)
to long lived connections (probably high powered backbone peers). If you
run out of disk seeks prefer processing new blocks to serving old parts of
the chain, etc.
