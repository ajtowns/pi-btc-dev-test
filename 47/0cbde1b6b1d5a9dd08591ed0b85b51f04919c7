I haven't done the math on this, so it may be a terrible idea. :)
I've been wondering if block propagation times could also be improved by allowing peers to request the list of transaction hashes that make up a block, and then making a follow-up request to only download any transactions not currently known. I'm not sure what percentage of transactions a node will usually already have when it receives a new block, but if it's high I figure this could be beneficial.
