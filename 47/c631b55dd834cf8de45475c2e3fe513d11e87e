Make the default soft vote = to previous max block size * 1.09 every 12k (or whatever mirrors the hard cap growth rate) and don't allow voting to lower the soft limit and I think you have something.

You need a default that grows because most miners are lazy and will do squirrelly things like hard code 8000000 as their vote permanently.  

Make the lazy miners' default choice grow at the hard cap growth rate and you should be ok if you want voting.
