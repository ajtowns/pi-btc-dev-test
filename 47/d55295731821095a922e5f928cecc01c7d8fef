Wait, I thought SOCKS4 was supposed to help somehow in terms of prevention
of leaking of information?

Or maybe I am misremembering.  Here's what I'm thinking of...
1) https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Preventing_Tor_DNS_Leaks

2) More regarding TOR,
"

I keep seeing these warnings about SOCKS and DNS information leaks. Should
I worry?

The warning is:

Your application (using socks5 on port %d) is giving Tor only an IP
address. Applications that do DNS resolves themselves may leak
information. Consider using Socks4A (e.g. via Polipo or socat) instead.

https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#WarningsAboutSOCKSandDNSInformationLeaks

I'm not sure that means I'm screaming fire or anything, but isn't there
some good reason for SOCKS4 and SOCKS4A?
Or maybe another way to ask this is:  Looking at an example in which
someone is running Tor, Privoxy, I2P, and FoxyProxy together while running
Bitcoin Core, would there be a problem with having a setting for SOCKS4A
for traffic in such a setup given the changes proposed to remove SOCKS4 as
suggested in bitcoin-development?

Probably there is just a simple answer to that last question, like "no."
But I thought I'd ask.
