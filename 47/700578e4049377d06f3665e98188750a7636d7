Three quick examples of duplicated strings. There are many more. Some of
the smaller ones may make sense to have duplicated several times in
english as their translated versions may differ in other languages. But
with these below I don't see the point.

Twice, with a small difference (<b> vs. none):

WARNING: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will
<b>LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS</b>! Are you sure you wish to encrypt your
wallet?

WARNING: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will
LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS! Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?

Again twice, with a small difference (%s vs %1):

This transaction is over the size limit. You can still send it for a fee
of %1, which goes to the nodes that process your transaction and helps
to support the network. Do you want to pay the fee?

Twice, looks exactly the same:

Generated coins must wait 120 blocks before they can be spent. When you
generated this block, it was broadcast to the network to be added to the
block chain. If it fails to get into the chain, it will change to "not
accepted" and not be spendable. This may occasionally happen if another
node generates a block within a few seconds of yours.
