Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Dynamic limit to the block size - BIP draft discussion
Message-ID: <CAG0bcYzzg4yeQvd27PZu5Fqv1ULS3cKeQHaRZ2zPcM3OASw1cg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I know many of us feel that the last thing the Bitcoin community needs is
another BIP related to the block size, but after a lot of reading and
commenting, I'd like to throw this idea out there.

I've already written it up as a BIP and would like some constructive
feedback/suggestions/alternatives related to some of the variables in my
specification:


Dynamic limit to the block size
=======================

The goal is to dynamically increase the maximum block size conservatively,
but allow meaningful relief to transaction volume pressure in response to
true market demand. The specification follows:

- Every 4032 blocks (~4 weeks), the maximum block size will be increased by
10% *IF* a minimum of 2000 blocks has a size >= 60% of the maximum block
size at that time
  + This calculates to theoretically 13 increases per year
- The maximum block size can only ever be increased, not decreased

For example, if this rule were to be instituted January 1st 2016, with a
present maximum block size 1 MB, the limit would be increased to 1.1 MB on
January 29th 2016. The theoretical maximum block size at the end of 2016
would be ~3.45 MB, assuming all 13 increases are triggered.

As the maximum block size rises, so the cost of artificially triggering an
increase in the maximum block size.


Regards,
Wash
