As you know I was forwarded that email first, and because I *do* respect
your privacy I consulting with you via private IRC chat first, and as
you wished I didn't publish it. The hacker presumably gave up waiting
for me to do so and published it themselves seven months ago; to make
that clear I linked the source(1) of the email in my message. Those
emails simply are no longer private.

Frankly personal attacks like this - "your hypocrisy really is
bottomless, isn't it?", "Satoshi's hacker had no illusions about your
horrible personality" - simply don't belong on this mailing list and I
think we would all appreciate an apology.
