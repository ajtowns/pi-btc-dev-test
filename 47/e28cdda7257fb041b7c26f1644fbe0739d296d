Researchers should also keep in mind that some of developers are 
immature and have limited knowledge or experience beyond their Bitcoin 
expertise ("Idiot-savants").  Others want to be in "charge" of 
drama-laced posts on reddit and they get upset if others do the same 
things.

In any case these rants and attacks by Todd and Garzik should be posted 
on their personal blogs or reddit instead of this list.
