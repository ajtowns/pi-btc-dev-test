I wonder are there any other blockers or modifications that need to be
made for this to be merged?

Latest version of the document:
https://github.com/afk11/bips/blob/213e8a27a3a2eaaf44f79221a9f9f888af002801/bip-0067.mediawiki

arbitrary scripts, so it may very well turn out to be the case that the
above rule is too restrictive in many cases - I certainly would not want
to do a soft-fork to enforce this, or even make it an IsStandard() rule.

I think it's fair that implementers are free to order them however they
please. But I think there is good reason for wallets to opt in to the
convention and declare this, for ease of recovery, and for
interoperability reasons.
