I don't want to send a mail to you or chat with you when I'm buying something
in your webshop. Or do you mean my client does that automatically? Why not
through an HTTP connection like the one I'm already using anyway to view
the static address on your website?

They still require you to give me your public key root, and me to give
you the ephemeral private key I generated, optionally together with what
I'm paying you for. That's bidirectional communication to me. Agreed, your
scheme requires a few steps less, but I believe mine is far more flexible
and user-friendly.
