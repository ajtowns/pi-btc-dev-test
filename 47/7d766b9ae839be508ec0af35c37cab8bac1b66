I think it would be better to have the deadlines set as block counts.  That
eliminates the need to use the median time mechanism.

The deadline could be matched to a "start-line".  The definition would then
be something like

BIP 105
Start block: 325000
End block: 350000
Activation: 750 of 1000
Implication: 950 of 1000
Bit: 9

This would allow creation of a simple table of known BIPs.  It also keeps
multiple users of the bit as strictly separate.

The alternative to the start time is that it is set equal to the deadline
or implication time of the previous user of the bit.

Was the intention to change the 95% rule.  You need 750 of the last 1000 to
activate and then must wait at least 1000 for implication?
