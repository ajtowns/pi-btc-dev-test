Sounds reasonable.

The change in BIP-34 doesn't cause old client to reject the main chain.

The increase to the maximum block size would be rejected by old
clients, so is different.

Adding new opcodes (as long as they act like a NOP on success) also
doesn't cause a disagreement about what is the longest chain, in the
end.  Miners might end up mining chains which are guaranteed to be
orphaned at worst.

So, how is max block size to be decided then?
