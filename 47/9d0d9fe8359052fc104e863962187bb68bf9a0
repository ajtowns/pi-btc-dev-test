I am generally not interested in a system where we rely on miners to make
that judgement call to fork off nodes that don't pay attention and/or
disagree with the change. This is not because I don't trust them, but
because I believe one of the principle values of the system is that its
consensus system should be hard to change.

I can't tell you what code to run of course, but I can decide what system I
find interesting to build. And it seems many people have signed off on
working towards a plan that does not include a hard fork being scheduled
right now: https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases
