We're talking about seeds here, not hardware wallets.

For a hardware wallet theft scenario, if you're worried about muggers you can
make the hardware have secret accounts with different seeds, *without* risking
user funds getting lost - a much more likely scenario - due to mistyped
passwords.

In any case, even if you were to do this type of design, a much better idea is
to use a checksum by default to reject invalid passwords, while having an
advanced-use-only option to override that checksum. The virtual file encryption
filesystem encfs does exactly this with its --anykey flag. This allows advanced
users to do their thing, while protecting the majority of users for whome this
feature is dangerous.
