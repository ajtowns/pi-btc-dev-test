Interesting.

1. How do you know who was first? If one node can figure out where
more transactions happen he can gain an advantage by being closer to
him. Mining would not be fair.

2. "A merchant wants to cause block number 1 million to effectively
have a minting fee of 50BTC." - why should he do that? That's the
entire tragedy of the commons problem, no?
