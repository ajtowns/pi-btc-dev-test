If the freedom to pick architecture exists, Moxie is a nice, compact, easy
to audit alternative:
     http://moxielogic.org/blog/pages/architecture.html
     https://github.com/jgarzik/moxiebox

Scaling can occur at the core level, rather than hyper-pipelining, keeping
the architecture itself nice and clean and simple.
