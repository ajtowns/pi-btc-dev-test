I say keep it simple.

If the 75% threshold is hit, then support suddenly drops off below 50%,
"meh" -- there will be a big ruckus, everybody will freak out, and miners
will refuse to build big blocks because they'll worry that they'll get
orphaned.

Adding more complexity for a case that ain't gonna happen (and isn't a
disaster if it does) is a mistake, in my humble opinion.
