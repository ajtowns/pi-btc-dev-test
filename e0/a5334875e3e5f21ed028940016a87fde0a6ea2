"Uncontroversial" doesn't really express the correct idea.

There has been a lot of confusion over "consensus rules/code" anyway, so while 
we're on the subject of terminology, I would suggest we change *that* use of 
"consensus" instead to clear up the confusion. It would probably work quite 
well to rename it to "concord rules/code", and leave "consensus" for 
describing the actual process by which humans agree on changes to the concord.

Anyone else have any thoughts on this subject?

(Note Core currently has "consensus" only 249 times, most of which are simply 
identifier names, so it would be trivial to make this change.)
