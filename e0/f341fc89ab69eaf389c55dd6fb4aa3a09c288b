Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Core Devs : can you share your thoughts about all
 BIPs on this website ?
Message-ID: <CA+1nnr=gMkwse5s8u+dDWfB4V7uswU8c-R7dRKQ=7j8P5w0mgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks, btcdrak, I just added the column and you in the list. (looks nicer)

What I am calling "core devs" in the website is only "commit access
people", should I rename this group ?
I just want a way to improve readability of the website by grouping, I am
open to all subjection on different way of grouping.

I'm good for adding Mike Hearn, Adam Back, Mark Friedenback, Jorge Timons,
Nick Szabo, Meni Rosenfeld, Charlee Lee.

If some of you are reading this list, please send me your PGP public key.
For the others, any idea where I can hunt their PGP public keys ?
