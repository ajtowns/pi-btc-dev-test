If you've got any ideas for a better forum, let me know.

MtGox is one of the largest public faces of the code being developed here. If
the public perception is that this is a bitcoin protocol flaw, then we need
some damned strong and compelling public arguments about why it ain't so. But
after some thought, that's not the critical issue I want to raise on this list.

If something about the implementation, the protocol, of bitcoin-qt or bitcoind
makes it easy for an attacker to mutate transactions and hard for an 'end-user'
such as MtGox to confirm payments, then we've got a fundamental user-interface
flaw.

We can get all indignant about RTFM or telling the users they are idiots, but
that's not really going to be good for long-term adoption and use.

My opinion is part of the development process should be to react to public
perceptions of how the code is being used (and mis-used), and how the market is
being manipulated, and try to improve it so the whole system is stable,
predictable, and friendly to users.
