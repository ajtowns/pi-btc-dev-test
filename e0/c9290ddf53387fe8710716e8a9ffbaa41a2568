Because I can potentially waste bandwidth of all nodes forever (well as long
as users are still scanning blocks with my transactions in them) with O(1) work.

Though I'm not sure how much of a threat is vs just paying 1e-8 btc to lots of
addresses which would only be less bad by some constant factor as worse.
I guess I should try to attack it and see how bad the pollution I can construct
should be. (offline, of course)
