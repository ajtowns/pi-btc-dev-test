Like I might want to move *specific* utxo's from/to my joinmarket wallet, but not create a (privacy losing / expensive) transaction. Both core and joinmarket fail at this at a practical point of view.

(tangential, but yes coin control in JM is an obviously necessary
feature and will be done, I just don't have time).

Is there a missing word. "by giving a person.."? Not actually sure what
you're getting at here but I suspect it's again tangential to this BIP
discussion.

I made multiple implementations of bustapay from both the sending/receiving end, so I could try develop the easiest to implement system that is still practical.

You know, there's considerable evidence to the contrary, I'd argue: this
idea *has* been implemented already three times: by yourself, by myself
and by Samourai. And in fully incompatible ways :) So I think the
limiting factor is in fact creating a standard that a reasonable number
of people could agree with (and I like operational definitions, so
subjective as it is, I like the goal of "good/clear enough that it could
be incorporated into something like BtcPayServer")

But in practice it's hugely overkill and significantly increases the implementation complexity complexity and is poorly supported. Switching to just a raw transaction actually made everything easier. (And that's not to criticise PSBT, I would definitely want to use it in other contexts).

But this relates back to my first "generic" point that you haven't
addressed here - protocol versioning and the possibility of more than
one option. Perhaps more realistic (debatable): have the current version
be non-PSBT but with a plan to have a version bump with PSBT in future.
Stuff like that. It seems crazy to actually long term reject it.

So if nothing else, hopefully I'll have demonstrated it's a pretty practical way of doing things.

I don't want to be that guy, but this was a central part of the proposal
that came of the meetup last summer and is in Haywood's blogpost. I mean
if you came up it with separately, then cool :) But I was there, that
was established immediately as the right way of doing this to avoid a
trivial attack.
What might have confused you is all that stuff about multiple candidates
and even ZKP approaches - those were just extra ideas about making it
really secure at large scale; but those ideas don't quite meet the goal
(for various reasons); well, arguably. The basic anti-DOS of an initial
non-coinjoin was sorta central.
(Also I'm noting you didn't respond to my critique of your "always use
the same contributions" defence; I mean, probably that's fine, it was
only really saying it isn't perfect. Was just curious to hear
your/others thoughts on it).

> Also your analysis on "Unnecessary Input Heuristic" is pretty cool, but I also don't like telling people to "avoid the UIH2" without providing the actual algo they should use. But really I think it's better off in a sort of article "how to pick contributed inputs" or something, as while it's nice it's not a huge deal and there's a lot of debatable tradeoffs that can/should be used. For instance the implementation I wrote for bustabit.com currently just heavily biases tainted inputs (e.g. ones associated with address reuse).

Good point about algo.
I wrote my best effort at a procedure here:
https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/4551b947789d3216bacfcb7af25e029e#gistcomment-2799709

I asked for comments on it but got none back so far (gists are terrible
for this unfortunately, perhaps I'll have more luck on the list).

I would argue that this issue *should* be mentioned on the BIP. A *huge*
part of what makes PayJoin/BustaPay of interest is the steganographic
feature, if you don't pay attention to this then it doesn't look like a
payment (caveat.-->).
The counterargument is Laurent's statistics which I previously linked,
suggesting that maybe 30% of txs violate this anyway, today. I'm not
sure about that, will need more analysis; Core's SRD algo may be one
reason, but anyway ... better to make things look like payments.

It doesn't hurt to prompt an implementer to do this; whether it's
feasible in that specific wallet situation or not is up to them; whether
they want to go hog wild and control percentages of UIH1 and UIH2 and
whatnot is there business, or they can totally ignore it - but without
it being mentioned in the BIP, they may not even think of it.

A last point, you also don't see value in being more explicit about
simple things like transaction version and locktime? Even if you think
these things should *not* be controlled, e.g. the protocol should allow
either transaction version, then it'd be better to explicitly say so.
