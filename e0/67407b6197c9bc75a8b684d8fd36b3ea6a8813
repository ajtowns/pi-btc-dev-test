This sounds like a useful idea for improving the privacy of coinswap.
Traditionally coinswap mixing had an anonymity set related to the number
of multisig transactions being used on the blockchain. With the new tech
of Schnorr, MAST and now this Taproot, with sufficient adoption
coinswap's anonymity set could be much higher, potentially including
almost every other on-chain transaction.
