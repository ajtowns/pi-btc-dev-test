This discussion seems to be a lot of hot air over a simple observation that
estimates are imperfect and always will be. I do not understand you vehement
opposition the notion that a backup is a good thing except in the context that
replacement to change fees is halfway to profit-seeking replacement by fee.


Peter Todd:

You did a fair bit of leg work for replace-by-fee. Seems to me that
replace-for-fee will help prep infrastructure to eventual replace-by-fee usage,
while avoiding some of the politics around zero-conf transactions.

Go dust off your code and make it happen. I want to see a mempool
implementation similar to what you did for me on replace-for-fee, and I
understand much of the code is written in any case. This time I also want to
see a increasetxfee RPC command, and erasewallettx RPC command to deal with
duplicates. (I know touching the wallet code is scary) Having all will enable
usage, and I can imagine getting pools to use this will be easy enough.
(eligius?)

Here is your 4BTC bounty. In the event I am not around Gregory Maxwell can also
adjudicate. If both you and him feel someone else deserves it, by all means
send them the funds

(I realized right after my Tor payment protocol bounty that I would need some
bit of uniqueness like a bounty-specific pubkey to disambiguate multiple such
bounties!)
