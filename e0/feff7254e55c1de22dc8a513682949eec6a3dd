It's not quite enough to just do SHA512, you missed out this condition
(incredibly rare as it is):

> In case IL is 0 or ?n, the master key is invalid.

Also I can't see how I would use this to seed a hardware wallet that
requires a BIP39 seed as mentioned in your abstract.

For both of those reasons, you may want to just invent/formalize a scheme
that takes Cards -> Entropy.
>From that Entropy one can generate BIP39, and non-BIP39 fans can just
continue, generate and store their root xprv.

Prior art: Note that Ian Coleman's BIP39 site already supports Cards (and
Dice), see the logic here:
https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/blob/master/src/js/entropy.js

Note it detected "full deck". It also calculates the Total Bits of Entropy
and can handle card replacement and multiple decks.

PS, you're a bit out on your entropy calculation, log2(52!) ~= 225.58 bits,
not 219.
