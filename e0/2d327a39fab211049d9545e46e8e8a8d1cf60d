There's been a number of uses found for tx-replacement beyond simply
modifying fees. In additition, allowing for the value of a specificly
designated change address to be changed after the fact is not compatible
with current zero-conf-using implementations; they don't know to treat a
txout as special so allowing its value to be reduced would allow for a
zeroconf attack.

Anyway, if you look at the code that actually implements the
replacement, it's extremely simple already. I see no reason to make it
less general; transaction relaying rules are not part of consensus.
