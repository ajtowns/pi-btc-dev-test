Needs a prototype implementation first. The version with no prefix is
the simple one and doesn't have any other dependencies; the prefix
version is harder because it isn't clear yet what's the best way to
force the prefix, or for that matter whether scriptPubKey or
H(scriptPubKey) indexes will be available.

It's on my todo list, but as you've probably noticed my todo list is
rather long. :)
