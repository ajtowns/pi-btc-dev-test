I think the sourceforge mailing list system had the hiccups this
weekend; sorry for Pieter's messages appearing in your inbox multiple
times, it is not his fault.

I deleted the extra copies from the mailing list archives.


As for the contents of his message, since this mailing list was not
working discussion wandered into the pull request:
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/936

Assuming this mailing list is now fixed, I'd like to pull that
discussion back here.  The executive summary:  Pieter and I feel like
BIP 22 is overly complicated, and would like it to be simpler. I'd
especially like to hear what people think will be the "will be used by
lots of pool customers" features and what are the "will be used by
less than 5% of pool customers" features.
