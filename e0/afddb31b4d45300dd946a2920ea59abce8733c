Ah ok, coming from cvs/svn, it's a bit different to find things.
There's something to be said for maintenance of pior branches.
Though I see some things I can use in github and my work would
be more useful there, so maybe I'll stwitch to that from gitorius/0.6.x.

Presumably the github/0.6.2 branch is safe for production?

What degree of caution about wallet eating should be
made for those using github/master?
