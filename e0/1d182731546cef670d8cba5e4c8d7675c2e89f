Thank you,



The benches are running in Google Cloud Engine; currently on 8 vCPU
32gb, but I tend to switch hardware regularly.


Roughly, the results are better for Bitcrust with high end hardware and
the difference for total block validations is mostly diminished at 2
vCPU, 7,5 gb.


Note that the spend-tree optimization primarily aims to improve peak
load order validation; when a block with pre-synced transactions comes
in, but this is tricky to accurately bench with Core using this simple
method of comparison by logs.


I will upgrade to, and show the results against 0.14 in the next weeks.


Best,

Tomas
