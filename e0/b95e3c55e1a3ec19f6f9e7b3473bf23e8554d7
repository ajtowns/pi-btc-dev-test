It's not really our place to police that ... plus it's perfectly safe to
be running Bitcoin Core as a full node on XP. It's just the wallet
functionality that people should be careful about. We're talking about
such a small intersection of people who are running XP, have systems
powerful enough to run Bitcoin Core, and use the wallet functionality.
