I'm concerned that miners are prematurely bumping their soft limit to 1 MB 
lately. The only reason block size limit lifting is remotely reasonable is if 
we can trust miners to at the very least keep their soft limits set at a 
manageable size, but this assumption appears to already be failing in 
practice.

We are unlikely to approach 1 MB of actual volume by November, so I would 
prefer to see the activation date on this moved later - maybe November 2016, 
if not 2017. It would also be an improvement to try to follow reasonably-
expected bandwidth increases, so 15% (1.15 MB) rather than doubling. Doubling 
in only a few months seems to be far from a "conservative" increase.

If we can get some kind of commitment from miners not to move their soft 
limits beyond 1 MB until some future-agreed-on point, maybe the BIP is 
acceptable as-is.

Hardforks are not something where voting makes sense. They need consensus 
among /nodes/, not majority among /miners/. No hardfork has ever had such a 
vote.
