Sorry to run on, a correction is needed.  A much better approximation 
requires that the rule-following minority finds the next TWO blocks, so 
the cost is

(total miner revenue of block)*(fraction of hashpower following the rule)^2

So the lower bound cost in this very pessimistic scenario is .0025 BTC,  
still quite high for one transaction.  I guess miner could try to make a 
business out of mining double-spends, to defray that cost.
