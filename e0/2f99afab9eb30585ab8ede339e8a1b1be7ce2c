Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Pull request for translation - who reviews it?
Message-ID: <CANf5GBgY5FCVXbfq6X4TQJhSgEo+0VPxchd4oFWvG_k+hYmxww@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I posted this question on the forums but got no answers.

I'd like to make some improvements to the Swedish translation of the
client. I understand the technical side of making a pull request etc.,
but will my request be accepted? There aren't many people in the
project who can judge if the Swedish translation is good or not, so
will it simply be accepted if noone opposes it?

Previous Swedish translations seem to have been commited by codler, is
this person "responsible" for the Swedish translation? Related to
this, is there anywhere I can see a list of people who have
permissions to make a pull?

David
