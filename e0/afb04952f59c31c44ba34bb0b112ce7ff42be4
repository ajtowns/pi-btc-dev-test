This discussion is *necessarily* about soft/hard fork technicalities, as 
there is no governance in Bitcoin beyond the *nature* of the consensus 
protocol. The "established criteria" you mention is merely the nature of 
hardforks. It is completely inapplicable and has never been the necessary 
case for softforks, which can be enforced by merely a miner majority.
