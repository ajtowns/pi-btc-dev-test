Worse yet - transaction malleability creates derative works with multiple
copyright holders (the original one, plus the author of the modification).
Is that even legal to do? What to do if a miner unknowingly accepts an
illegally modified transaction in a block? And can he who modified it ALSO
sue anybody replicating the block for infringement?

Better just put everything in public domain, or the closest thing to it you
can get. Copyright in the blockchain is essentially the DVDCSS illegal
prime mess all over again, but in a P2P network.
