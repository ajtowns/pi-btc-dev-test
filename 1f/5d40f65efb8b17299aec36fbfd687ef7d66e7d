No, BIP30 prevents duplicate tx hashes in the case where the new tx hash
duplicates that of a preceding tx with unspent outputs.

There was one such case that had already become buried in the chain at
the time, so it was exempted from validation. There was another case of
a duplicate hash, but it's predecessor was spent so it complied with the
new rule.

Both of these cases resulted from exact duplicate txs, which BIP34 now
precludes. However nothing precludes different txs from having the same
hash.
