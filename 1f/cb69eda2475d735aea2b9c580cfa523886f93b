Hello all,

It has been way to long since last major release. Many improvements and new
features have been added to master since, so we'd like to do a 0.9rc1
release soon.

The current aim is next month, February 2014.

Of course there are still some open issues that need to be resolved before
release
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?milestone=12&state=open

If there is something else that you're working on and needs to end up in
0.9, or know of some nasty bug in master that should absolutely be solved
first, please tell.

Wladimir
