Yes, this proposal is a policy that everyone would be free to ignore.  I
should have introduced the situation in which this *unenforceable* policy
makes sense to me.  Here it is:

Every miner is listening for valid block solutions but might receive two
valid blocks and then they have to decide which one to use.  Choosing the
one you saw first is the default behavior.  In that situation, we'd all
like everyone to choose the same block.  I propose that a better heuristic
than "first seen" is to compare the BTCDD, *but only of transactions you
already have in your mempool*, and

*weight the BTCDD so that txns you got earlier are more important.*
The heuristic is most useful when the two blocks are received within a
small window of time, opting for the first-seen rule otherwise.  I assume
many miners have an idea of how long it takes for anyone's new block to get
across the network, and more specifically, the range of times it takes for
new solutions to get to themselves.  During this little time window, the
chances are 50/50 that they'll choose the right block.  If the default
behavior were to use BTCDD during that time window (one second? I have no
idea!), then the chances would be significantly better.

I think Jorge is right that it doesn't benefit miners.  It doesn't hurt
them either, unless they are trying to do selfish mining.  Well, it
benefits them in terms of increased bitcoin stability by A) making it
easier for clients to decide which block is valid when they see two
competing with each other, B) motivating miners to add transactions instead
of mining empty blocks, C) severely decreasing the utility of any global
private network of nodes intended to spread selfishly-mined blocks, and D)
motivating miners to stay well-connected so that they get transactions
quickly.

I sent this to the list because it is only useful if it is set as default
behavior since most miners leave the defaults alone, and the benefits don't
materialize unless a majority follows the policy.
