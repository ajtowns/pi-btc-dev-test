Thanks for references. Yeah, I don't need X509 signing (if I could use certificates, I wouldn't need to include PR in the URL in the first place).

I presume you used "BITCOIN:-<payment request>" instead of "bitcoin:?r=somescheme://<payment request>" to make it more compact. 

I also tried to look up Base43, but I could not find any info on how it is specifically optimized for QR codes. Could you enlighten me?

The goal is to allow device to generate a multi-output payment request on its own, without relying on the server and x509 certificates. When scanned via QR code from, say, POS, it's pretty secure, so no additional authentication needed.
