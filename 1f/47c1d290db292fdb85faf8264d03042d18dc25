"good behavior" models? I intentionally modeled what should be a worst-case.

If you have a specific network topology you want to model, please email me
details and I'll see what worst case is. Or, even better, take my
simulation code and run it yourself (it's C++, easy to compile, easy to
modify if you think it is too simple).

I get frustrated with all of the armchair "but what if..."
how-many-miners-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin arguments.

No, they're not. They are only at a disadvantage when THEY mine bigger
blocks.

I guess I wasn't clear in the "do bigger miners have an advantage" blog
post.

I spent last week doing simulation and study. Please, do your own
simulation and study if you don't trust my results. There are big
full-scale-bitcoin-network-simulations spinning up that should have results
in a month or two, also, but there will ALWAYS be "but we didn't think
about what if THIS happens" scenarios that can require more simulation and
study.

Last night's transaction volume test shows that most miners do just go
along with defaults:

Mining is a competitive business, the marginal miner will ALWAYS be going
out of business.

That is completely independent of the block size, block subsidy, or
transaction fees.

The question is "will there be enough fee+subsidy revenue to make it
unprofitable for an attacker to buy or rent enough hashpower to
double-spend."

It is obvious to me that bigger blocks make it more likely the answer to
that question is "yes."

I have said repeatedly that if it was left completely up to me I would go
back to Satoshi's original "there is no consensus-level blocksize limit".

20MB is a compromise.

... and now you're pissing me off. I have NEVER EVER said that they need
bigger blocks to continue operating. Please stop being overly dramatic.

They believe that bigger blocks are better for Bitcoin.

Brian Armstrong at Coinbase, in particular, said that smaller blocks drive
centralization towards services like Coinbase ("look ma! No blockchain
transaction!" <-- if you pay a Coinbase merchant from your Coinbase
wallet), but he supports bigger blocks because more transactions on our
existing decentralized network is better.
