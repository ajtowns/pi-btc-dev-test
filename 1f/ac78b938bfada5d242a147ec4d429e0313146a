Subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.4.x stable branch
Message-ID: <201109181930.59565.luke@dashjr.org>

Gavin, Jeff, et al:

A group of developers would be interested in maintaining 0.4 into the future 
as a stable branch (ie, bugfixes only). Would you be willing to plan on making 
the next mainline version after 0.4, being called 0.5, so we can release 
0.4.1, 0.4.2, etc? If we prepare the git repository + tags, would you guys be 
willing to make the actual release builds + source, and/or post such on the 
websites you administrate?

Luke and various others in #bitcoin-stable
