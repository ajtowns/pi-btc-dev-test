Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Scalable Semi-Trustless Asset Transfer via
 Single-Use-Seals and Proof-of-Publication

Thank you for your post, Peter. Why is it necessary to centralize the p-o-p
sidechain and have a maintainer? It seems the Bitcoin network will secure
the most critical element, which is the witness authenticity. Wouldn't a
second decentralized network be able to perform the functions of the
maintainer so the entire system is trustless?
