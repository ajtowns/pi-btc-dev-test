I see this behavior all the time. I am using the latest release, as far as I know. Version 4.30.

The same behavior occurs in the Testnet3 variant of the app. Go in there with an empty wallet and receive one payment and wait for it to confirm. Then send a payment and, before it confirms, try to send another one. The wallet won't let you send the second payment. It'll say something like, "You need x.xxxxxx more bitcoins to make this payment." But if you wait for your first payment to confirm, then you'll be able to make the second payment.

If it matters, I configure the app to connect only to my own trusted Bitcoin node, so I only ever have one active connection at most. I notice that outgoing payments never show as "Sent" until they appear in a block, presumably because the app never sees the transaction come in over any connection.
