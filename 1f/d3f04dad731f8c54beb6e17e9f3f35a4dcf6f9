Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Upcoming network event: block v2 lock-in
Message-ID: <CA+8xBpcwLUt=RBYynbQDwY2Bv1keCPy0pdXP4+8CG-wqvrxOCA@mail.gmail.com>

Once a supermajority (95%) of mining reaches block version 2,
nVersion==1 blocks will be rejected.  This event seems likely to occur
in the next week.

Version 2 block specification: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0034

Watching for the event: http://blockorigin.pfoe.be/top.php  The text
is at the bottom:
"We are currently at 100 out of the latest 1000 blocks on version 1
(10.00%) and 899 out of the latest 1000 blocks on version 2 (89.90%)"

Users should not be impacted.  Some ancient miners will produce
newly-invalid blocks (v1), that will get ignored.  The easy solution
is to mine using a recent bitcoind (0.7 or later).  If you are a miner
and need help upgrading to v2, ping us on #bitcoin-dev or
bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net.
