It's not about BIP process, it's possibly about content of particular
proposals.

There's no mess with stratum mining, except in your head. There's no
requirement to have BIP for everything what people do. Stratum is NOT
related to bitcoin protocol or bitcoin implementation, it is just custom,
pooled-mining extension and bitcoin network doesn't need to know about
Stratum existence at all.

There have been peer review of the protocol. You wanted to say "I was not
invited to do peer review", right?

Please don't start it AGAIN and stop bashing Stratum in your posts, at
least in bitcoin-dev mailing list.

I promised to write BIP draft for Stratum, I proposed and implemented
get_transactions method to allow Stratum jobs inspection. What more do you
want, seriously? I'm soo tired by you, Luke.

P.S. I'm sorry that other developers had to read such posts. I'll try to
sit on my hands next time.
