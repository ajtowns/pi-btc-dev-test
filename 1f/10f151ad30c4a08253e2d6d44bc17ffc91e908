Transactions that redeem an output containing (or referencing by means of
P2WSH) an OP_COUNT_ACKS are not broadcast by the network. That means that
the network cannot be DoS attacked by flooding with a transaction that will
not verify due to being too late.
The only parties that can include the redeem transaction are the miners
themselves.
Therefore I see no problem that an OP_COUNT_ACKS scriptSig transaction is
invalidated after the liveness times expires.
If there is no expiration, then polls can last forever and the system fails
to provide DoS protection for block validation since active polls can
accumulate forever.
