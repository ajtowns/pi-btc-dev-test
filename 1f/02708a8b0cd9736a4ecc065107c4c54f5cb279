Hampus, thanks for the explanation!

sounds good, though I'm unclear on how exactly to achieve (2) given that
any party I have ever transacted with (or otherwise knows an address of
mine) can send me coins at any time.  So it seems the only possible way
to be certain is to run a node that has never published an address to a
3rd party.  Is that accurate?

Another thing that could be done is to modify my own node so that it
actually rejects such tx, but then I have modified consensus rules
myself, thus defeating the goal of remaining with status-quo rules, and
anyway the rest of the network would accept the tx.  I guess the benefit
is that I could be certain of the remaining funds I have.

I suppose that it would be possible without modifying any rule to
construct a "certain balance" and an "uncertain balance".

I don't intend to do such modifications! just grasping for understanding.

I read the relevant parts, thanks!
