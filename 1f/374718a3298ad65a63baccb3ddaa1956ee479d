Have you talk to them? If not, how can you be sure they don?t run large number of standard nodes and actually make the network stronger? Personally I never bring claims like this if I just assume. A lot of people in the community really trust you, do you realize you potentially hurt them for no reason?


btw I do not work for them nor have any money invested in them in case anybody asks
