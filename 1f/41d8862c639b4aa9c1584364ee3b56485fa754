That's fine. Nobody is required to adopt an informational BIP if they do
not wish to do so.

They are "mere software changes" outside the control of the users and
wallet developers who may wish to use and implement payment codes, so
are indistinguishable from a network-level change.

Since Bitcoin Core 0.11, 80 byte OP_RETURN transactions are standard, so
that's what payment codes use:

Whether or not it "should" have an influence, it is an absolute fact
that Bitcoin users are affected by it.

A user whose transactions are not relayed or mined doesn't care about
the politics surrounding node policy.

Designing standards without putting the needs of its intended users
first is a great way to see the standard fail.

Have you ever heard the term "permissionless innovation" by chance?
Particularly in reference to Bitcoin?

If you don't like payment codes, then don't use them.
