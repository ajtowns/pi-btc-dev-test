Gavin, you assume that users must necessarily always follow the
hashrate majority, but this is not true.
In fact, it is the opposite: market forces make the hashrate follow the users.
Not following the hashrate majority is not necessarily insane.

If some users aren't happy with the new hardfork rules, they may never
upgrade. This is discussed (although I want to improve the text) under
the "Schism hardforks" section of BIP99 (which you may have some
complaints against, so please review
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/181/files#diff-e331b8631759a4ed6a4cfb4d10f473caR135
).

It is true that users of chain A may sell or their B-coins, but the
opposite is also true: users in chain B may sell all their A-coins.
Speculators will likely sell both and probably not buy again until the
initial uncertainty is gone (or they may never buy again, nobody can
predict this).

Let's use an example. Let's assume that a hardfork is rolled out to
completely remove the blocksize limit (I believe you would be against
that from previous conversations with you).
As long as there are users creating demand for the old-coins, there
will be miners mining the old coins.
This is not insane for neither users or miners no matter how big the
majority of users and/or miners in the new rules chain.

Again, probably the best place to discuss this kind of thing is
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/181 or the bitcoin-dev thread
linked from the BIP (
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/008936.html
).
