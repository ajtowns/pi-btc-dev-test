Any thoughts on the "95% better than 75%" and "grace period before miner
coordination instead of after" comments ?

None of the reasons you list say anything about the fact that "being lost"
(kicked out of the network) is a problem for those node's users.

I didn't say that.

Their own software stack may require more work to integrate the new rules
or their resources may not be immediately available to focus on this within
28 days they hadn't planned.

I believe it wold be less controversial to chose something that nobody can
deny is more than plenty of time for everyone  to implement the changes
like, say, 1 year. I wouldn't personally oppose to something shorter like 6
months for really simple changes, but I don't see how 28 can ever be
considered uncontroversial and safe for everyone. Just trying to help in
removing controversy from the PR, but if you still think 28 can be safe and
uncontroversial, feel free to ignore these comments on the concrete length
and please let me know what you think about the other points I raised.
