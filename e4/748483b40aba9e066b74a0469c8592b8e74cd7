I accidentally replied to Luke off-list, and this was his reply to my last
message:

"But wouldn't the server be a trusted third-party in this case?
I'm thinking it's very close to being possible for an untrusted server to do
this..."

If you are okay with anyone being able to view your PaymentRequest
messages, then you wouldn't need to encrypt them. Just upload them to the
server and let it give them away--no trust needed as long as you include a
signature. If you want only certain people to be able to see your messages,
then you need to denote those people in some way. In this situation, you
would do that by trading public keys and uploading encryptedPaymentRequest
messages to the server that only those people could read.

Using the encrypted method doesn't require the devices to be online, but it
does require at least one of the parties to know the other party's public
key. Do you have a specific use case in mind?
