Totally agree. My first thought is maybe you could keep bip37 filtering
as optional for unconfirmed transactions. Since you're only interested
in incoming transactions in this case you can create one big filter with
all your wallet's addresses and reuse that filter. The bip37 privacy
issues mainly come up when trying to get the filter to match both
incoming and outgoing transactions, which is not needed in this case.

Otoh, if you download the block from the same peer that you gave a bip37
filter then they could probably test the txs in the block against both
filters. :/
