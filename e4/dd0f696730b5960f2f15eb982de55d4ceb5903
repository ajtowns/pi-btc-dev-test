Hi Richard,

its great that people with a lot of experience in financial markets take
interest in these topics. I don't think you will receive the best answers
here. The Bitcointalk Altcoin section is currently the best place for such
announcements. I believe there is room for a better board/list for new 2.0
projects. Bitcoin dev is not very welcoming to discussions/debates/projects
which go beyond digital cash systems (assets, markets, etc.), as it is very
focused on the core problems which are under-funded.

Anyone who wants to build a better venue for 2.0 projects feel free to
contact me. This could be a mailing list or an upgraded message board. Most
such boards are project/currency specific, but there is one missing for
announcements.

In terms of markets on top of blockchains, I have sent a private email.

Regards,
Benjamin
