I understand.

I don't understand this part. In my scheme, a sidechain cannot reorganize unless the mainchain reorganizes, since the consensus loop only cares about matching the current block; it ignores splits and does not consider them valid.
But I suppose you are considering something like the Ethereum mutability feature, which I do not think is something you would want in a sidechain.

Do you not provide a single sidechain's h* twice in the block? Once in the coinbase and once in the briber's separate transaction?
In my scheme at least there is no indicator byte -- the "previous block" hash is the indicator of which sidechain it is extending. From your other emails on this list, it seems the ratchet is for withdrawals from sidechain to mainchain? If so, should it not only appear in only some of the sidechains (the ones which are currently doing some withdrawal?)?
