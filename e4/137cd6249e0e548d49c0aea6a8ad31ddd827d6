Subject: [Bitcoin-development] [PULL] When parsing base58 data,
	accept [0O] as o, and [l|!] as 1

 base58_liberal_parsing && git merge FETCH_HEAD

This simple modification allows base58 inputs to use zero and uppercase 'O' in 
place of lowercase 'O', as well as lowercase 'L', bar/pipe, and exclamation 
point in place of one. This allows more tolerance when inputting addresses or 
other data by manual typing, and gives a bit more variety to vanity addresses.
