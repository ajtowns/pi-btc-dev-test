First the implementation, then the technical design (BIP)... will the
analysis come after that?
Will there be any kind of simulations of tje proposed size or will thag
come only after activation on mainnet?
I assume the very last step will be activation on testnet 3 ?

Currently the only implementation that fulfills the requirements of the NYA
agreement is the segwit2x/btc1 implementation, which is being finalized
this week.

Segwit2mb does not fulfill the NYA agreement.

I'm asking now the segwit2x development team when a BIP will be ready so
that Core has the opportunity to evaluate the technical proposal.
