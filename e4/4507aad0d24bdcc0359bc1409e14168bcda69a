The proposal on that page is of a tree which does require random access
updates, it just positions entries in the order they happened to be added
instead of sorting by their hash. Once you start updating it to indicate
spent status all the exact same issues of TXO size and cache coherence on
updates show up again, but now you're using a more complex bespoke data
structure instead of a basic fundamental one.
