Linear growth is indeed the 'simplest' model for growth so removes
concerns of complexity using such a growth model. Seems like it might be
a safe compromise between exponential growth, zero growth and buys some
time to observe the longer term scale network behaviour. 

A simple linear growth 'hard' technical limit could also be used
conjunction with the simple periodic soft dynamic limit adjustment (e.g.
1.5x of moving average) as discussed recently. So that the combination
provides for growth, with fee pressure, up until if/when the technical
hard limit is hit. And if we keep hitting the hard limit that signals a
market demand for ancillary layers to be built out, that has been
missing until now.
