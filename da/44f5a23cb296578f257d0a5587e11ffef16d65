Many new users have started using the reference client which downloads
the whole blockchain from peers. There currently isn't a throttling
mechanism [1] so it's possible to quickly eat up your bandwidth. You
can try QoS on your router or use the -nolisten command line flag. You
will still relay transactions, just not serve the whole blockchain.
