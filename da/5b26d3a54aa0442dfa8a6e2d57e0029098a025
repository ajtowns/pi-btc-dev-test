First of all I do agree that a method for adjusting the difficulty in a
huge power drop is needed (I don't see it so much in power rises).

The current block generation with a fixed difficulty was chosen because it
it clear when to adjust and to what target difficulty it has to be
adjusted. If we were to use synchronized time windows and select the
hardest block it gets incredibly complicated as synchronization is not
possible in distributed systems. Even the smallest drift would allow for
forks in the chain all over the place. Furthermore the delay in propagation
will also cause forks.

If 1/2 of the network see one block as the hardest, and for the rest of the
network it came too late then we'll have a fork that stays with us quite a
while.

The block chain is described as a timestamp server in the paper, but it is
more of a proof-of-existence before, as the contained timestamp cannot be
trusted anyway.

Regards,
Chris
