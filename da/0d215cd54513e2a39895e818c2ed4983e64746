It's no different to the CA problem. People can only mentally handle a few
trust anchors, so for SSL it goes:

   1 User -> 2-3 browser makers -> 100's of CAs -> millions of websites

The trust starts out narrowly funnelled and grows outwards as things get
outsourced.

For this it'd go

   1 merchant -> 4-5 payment processing engines -> dozens of hardware
manufacturers -> hundreds of thousands of devices
