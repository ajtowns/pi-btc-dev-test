According to my understanding, Bitcoin protocol is a combination of several
components (node, miner, wallet..), you can use different licenses for
different components, as long as the components are well structured and
inter APIs are well defined and encapsulated, therefore, incompatible
licenses could be not an issue.
Please note that I'm not legal advisor and this is just my personal opinion.
