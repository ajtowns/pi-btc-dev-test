I highly doubt that is the best approach.

If this nExpiry field is a consensus rule, then the Merkle tree or the
appropriate paths through needs to be included with the transaction as
part of the network and on-disk data structures, so that proper
validation can be done. This would be both more disruptive and less
efficient than simply adding an nExpiry field to the transaction format,
as we do in Freimarkets.

If the field is pre-consensus (a mempool gentleman's agreement), then it
has no business in the transaction structure at all and should be
packaged in some sort of envelope container.
