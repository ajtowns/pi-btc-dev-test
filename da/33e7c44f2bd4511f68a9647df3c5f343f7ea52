I'm sorry but this is absolutely not the case, Milly. The reason that
people get defensive is that we have a carefully constructed process that
does work (thank you very much!) and is well documented. We talk about it
quite often in fact as it is a defining characteristic of how bitcoin is
developed which differs in some ways from how other open source software is
developed -- although it remains the same in most other ways.

Changes to the non-consensus sections of Bitcoin Core tend to get merged
when there are a few reviews, tests, and ACKs from recognized developers,
there are no outstanding objections, and the maintainer doing the merge
makes a subjective judgement that the code is ready.

Consensus-changes, on the other hand, get merged into Bitcoin Core only
after the above criteria are met AND an extremely long discussion period
that has given all the relevant stakeholders a chance to comment, and no
significant objections remain. Consensus-code changes are unanimous. They
must be.

The sort of process that exists in standards bodies for example, with
working groups and formal voting procedures, has no place where changes
define the nature and validity of other people's money. Who has the right
to reach into your pocket and define how you can or cannot spend your
coins? The premise of bitcoin is that no one has that right, yet that is
very much what we do when consensus code changes are made. That is why when
we make a change to the rules governing the nature of bitcoin, we must make
sure that everyone is made aware of the change and consents to it.

Everyone. Does this work? Does this scale? So far, it does. Uncontroversial
changes, such as BIP 66, are deployed without issue. Every indication is
that BIP 66 will complete deployment in the very near future, and we intend
to repeat this process for more interesting changes such as BIP65:
CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.

This isn't about no one stepping forward to be the "decider." This is about
no one having the right to decide these things on the behalf of others. If
a contentious change is proposed and not accepted by the process of
consensus, that is because the process is doing its job at rejecting
controversial changes. It has nothing to do with personality, and
everything to do with the nature of bitcoin itself.
