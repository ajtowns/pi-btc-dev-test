Related implementation detail:  Having pursued this train of thought,
I noted that you don't want to include too-young transactions that you
received in the past few seconds, because those are likely still
propagating around the network.

Absolutely.  One path I would like to see pursued is multiple
p2pool-esque chains.  Each with their own policy, perhaps with their
own administrative team.  ie. you could have a fully decentralized
p2pool-like chain, or multiple such chains, each with a stated
policy/reward pattern.  Or, GHash/BTCGuild/Eligius could run a
semi-centrally managed chain ultimately guaranteed not only by
protocol but by administrators' digital signatures.

In each case, advertising technical attributes about your pool [chain]
policy would give nodes the better ability to predict what is in an
upcoming block.

And the flip side of that, such predictions are never perfect.  Need
to make sure the fallback case, while undoubtedly more costly than the
Fast Path, is not overly painful.
