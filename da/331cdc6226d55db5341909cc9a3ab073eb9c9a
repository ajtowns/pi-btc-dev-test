This isn't something that makes sense at the address, since it represents the 
recipient and not the sender. Transactions are not sent from addresses ever.

This is already possible. Just nLockTime your withdrawls for some future 
block. Don't sign any transaction that isn't nLockTime'd at least N blocks 
beyond the present tip.
