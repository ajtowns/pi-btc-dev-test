Hi Peter, thank you for the review.  See below

The interesting thing is that the cost of attack varies smoothly as you
vary the POW weights.
To attack non-upgraded nodes, you still have to "51%" the original POW.
The reward going to that POW will vary smoothly between 1.0 * block_reward
and whatever
target value (e.g. 0.5 * block_reward) and the difficulty of attack will
tend to be proportional to that.

In a real hard-fork, your software just breaks at the fork point.  In this
case, it's just the non-upgraded
node security level declining from 100% to 50% over a long period of time.

I envision the transition of POW weights will be over 1-3 years, which
leaves plenty of time to
upgrade after the fork activates.

Note that the total transaction rate and block size don't materially
change, so I don't
see why the orphan rate will change.  Normal blocks are constrained to have
all of the txs of the aux blocks, so propagation time should stay the
same.  Am I missing
something?

"smooth-fork" perhaps? :)
