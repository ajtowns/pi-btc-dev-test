We integrated libconsensus into bits of proof. It works well, in-line for all test cases with our Java engine and is about 50% faster on a single thread.

The performance advantage unfortunatelly reverses if libconsensus is executed on several threads simultaneously as we do with the Java engine, since an error:

	Assertion failed: (pkey != NULL), function CECKey, file ecwrapper.cpp, line 96.

arises under that stress.

I guess that the cause is that thread callbacks as advised for OpenSSL on https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/threads.html are not registered.
Registering those however would require access to OpenSSL functions, not exported from the lib.

I?d be thankful for a pointer to a workaround.
