Dave's code is about switching blocks (instead of continuing on the
existing one), and, in that context, "old" means the first sibling the
node saw, and "new" is any subsequent block. I will disambiguate this
in the future, because I'm clearly confusing at least 1 person.

There's always a default, and if miners don't have any overriding
reason to change, they'll likely stick to it. Which is why Dave
started his statement with:

> Rather than (promising to, and when they don't actually, at least pretending to) use the first-seen block

Clearly recognizing that any changed logic is non-binding.
