Based on pull-capable dev comments, I've personally noted these branches as 
accepted for 0.7:

+ m) getmemorypool: longpolling support
+ luke-jr https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1355
+
+ m) Refactor transaction/accounting time
+ luke-jr https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1393

I also personally feel these are appropriate and ready for 0.7:

+
+ m) Treat generation (mined) transactions less different from receive
+ transactions
+ luke-jr https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1409

Also these, but they need testing:

+
+ m) Bitcoin-Qt (Windows only): enable DEP for bitcoin-qt.exe
+ diapolo https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1614

I also feel it is very important that Wumpus/laanwj decide on a name for his 
client (formerly known as Bitcoin-Qt) and add it to the software instead of 
simply claiming it is "Bitcoin" as it has for a week or so now - that change 
is anticompetitive and will confuse new users into thinking Bitcoin is the 
software too easily.
