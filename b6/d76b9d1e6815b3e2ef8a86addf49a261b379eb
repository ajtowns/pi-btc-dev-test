The de-centralized forum directly integrates the Bitcoin blockchain with every post. I can see how you misunderstood since I wasn't specific in my first email. I'm surprised no one has done this yet, people have done things very similar but never took the leap to integrate the actual Bitcoin blockchain. Basically http://cryptograffiti.info/ but with a parallel program that stores most of the data in a hash reference table, and shares that data via a torrent-esque system.
 
  The Bitcoin of thoughts.

One last comment here on this topic;
  
For anybody who wants to discuss decentralized communication mechanisms in general, they can come to www.reddit.com/r/p2pcomms (up until these decentralized forums have become stable and common).
  
I've seen quite a few more of these projects lately, I want to make a list of them and would definitely like to contribute to making them not just usable, but good enough to gain popularity on their own. 
  
(And in case you wonder about my approach to moderation: let every user pick which moderators / filters / servers he trusts, and let them share their subscription preferences in place of sharing links to centralized forums.)

 Zander is working on the same thing:    https://www.reddit.com/r/AetheralResearch/   
    
 But it's actually quite difficult to make it truly censorship-resistant: both in solving the theymos factor and spam/abuse/overloading as an attack.

 We have /r/bitcoinxt and so far it has been great. But we also need a regular forum.   
    
 Roger Ver controls    bitcoin.com, as I understand?    https://bitcoin.com/forum/ would be nice.   
    
 And it must be a real community, not "say whatever you want because free speech". We've seen how that turned out to be.   
    
 Something like    battle.net or Steam forums: heavily moderated, not for opinions, but for spam/noise/insults.   
    
 Again, this needs leadership. Anyone can install a forum software, what is needed is an "official seal of approval" and regular presence of top XT people there.   
    
 And a will to setup proper moderation. Then people will move.
