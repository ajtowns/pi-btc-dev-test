I like the UUID-as-path idea. That resolves the problem of how to share the
alt-chain merkle tree quite nicely.

The Merkle branch doesn't get stored indefinitely though, whereas the
coinbase hash does. The data stored in the coinbase [output] can always
just be the 256-bit root hash truncated to less.

I doubt the additional bytes make much difference really, so the additional
complexity may not be worth it. But it wouldn't be an issue to do.
