Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal: bip32 version bytes for segwit scripts
Message-ID: <CA+_kfXJPfbGD6cDiPZ+7Z_rwUVS6JQNW8Vb-YsgD2wsPhHoBjw@mail.gmail.com>

We support a change to the version bits of the HD serialization that will
inform the receiving utility of the exact derivation method used for the
pubkeys. Third-parties handling xpubs must not require additional
information from the user about the derivation path or serialization format
of the addresses under that xpub. When you have to ask, "Is this a SegWit
xpub?" then you've already lost.

Avoiding a total UX nightmare is in everyone's interests.

I think Luke and Thomas may be talking past one another. When exporting a
root master HD seed, encoding the {x,y,z}{pub,prv} distinctions makes no
sense, as the root seed should derive all paths for all coins. Wallets may
need additional code to discover which paths have been used when importing
a root seed. But when exporting / importing an account-level seed for
watch-only and receive address generation, changing the serialization
version bytes is appropriate and (in our view) essential to avoid loss of
funds.

The Electrum approach is nice but may not go far enough, as xpub and zpub
both list "P2PKH or P2SH." Why not expand the number of version prefixes to
eliminate the ambiguity?
