Agreed!

A closely related example is my own Treechains work, which got a bunch of
excitement when I first published the idea. But would I have wanted it on a
roadmap? Hell no: sure enough, as it got more peer review others (and myself!)
found that it was going to be a harder than it initially looked to actually get
into production.

Drivechains is definitely in that situation right now.

Also don't forget that proper security peer review takes a *lot* of work. I
myself have a todo list item to respond to Paul's post on Drivechains, but I
need to spend a few days to do that and just haven't had the time (not to
mention that no-one is paying me to do general Bitcoin dev work right now).
