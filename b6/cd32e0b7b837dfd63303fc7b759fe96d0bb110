This is simply not true given current available data, i.e. the current
blockchain and ongoing not-spam transaction rate/pool.

According to your own numbers even, this is not true.  99% of the
network runs a wide variety of rules and versions.  Even with a
"critical" security announcement, the percentage of those running the
latest version is not large.

Miners are not the -only- ones that get a say in what is spam, and
what is not.  If miners are generating garbage, network users have the
right to veto that garbage.
