Nothing is "orphaned" unless miners are acting negligently or maliciously. 
Incentivising honest behaviour from miners is inherently part of Bitcoin's 
design, and these changes are necessary for both that and keeping the network 
secure. This doesn't do harm; it reduces risk of harm.

I don't appreciate the uncalled-for character assassination, and it doesn't 
belong on this mailing list.

Since you apparently have a drastically different opinion on this subject, I 
think it may be best to wait until after BIP148 to continue the discussion 
(thereby having more real-world information to work from).

Therefore, I have opened a new pull request with just the parts you seem to be 
objecting to removed. Please let us know if this version is satisfactory.
