It's not a question of right vs. wrong.  Either method has consequences 
for user expectations and behavior.

With fixed-block mempool expiration, the expiration time is variable.  
User can get an alert, but at an unpredictable time.

With fixed-timeout, the likelihood of expiration is more variable 
(expiration occurrence is unpredictable regardless), but any expiration 
will occur at the timeout.
