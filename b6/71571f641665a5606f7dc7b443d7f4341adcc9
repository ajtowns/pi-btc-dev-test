That evaluation largely depends on the needs of the service in question.

In my decentralized identity (SIN) example, you merely need to prove
to the cloud that you sacrificed some bitcoins to any-miner.  The
confirmed, in-chain, non-coinbase transaction becomes the root node
for off-chain identity data.

The penalty for the user withholding the sacrifice transaction is that
their SIN is not created.  That incentive may not exist in that way,
in another service.

Just referring to a standard, fee-bearing, user-created bitcoin
transaction, where output_value < input_value.  The fee is paid to the
first miner who includes that transaction in a block, as part of the
protocol.
