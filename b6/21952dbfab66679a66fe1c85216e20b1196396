To avoid duplication of looking up this statistic among readers, here
are the various recent difficulties:

<50% of current hash rate was last seen roughly six retarget periods (12
weeks) ago and <25% of current hash rate was last seen roughly 29 periods
(58 weeks) ago.

I think that's reasonably strong evidence for your thesis given that
the increases in hash rate from the introduction of new efficient
equipment are likely partly offset by the removal from the hash rate of
lower efficiency equipment, so the one-year tail of ~25% probably means
that less than 25% of operating equipment is one year old or older.

However, it is my understanding that most mining equipment can be run at
different hash rates. Is there any evidence that high-efficiency miners
today are using high clock speeds to produce more hashes per ASIC than
they will after halving?  Is there any way to guess at how many fewer
hashes they might produce?

Maybe I'm not thinking this through thoroughly, but I don't think it's
possible to significantly advance inflation unless the effective hash
rate increases by more than 300% at the halving.  With the proposal
being replied to, if all mining equipment operation before the
halving continued operating after it, the effective increase would be
200%. That doubling in effective hash rate would've been offset in
advance through a reduction in the effective hash rate in the weeks
before the halving.

Exacerbated unintentional selfish mining is a much more significant
concern IMO, even if it's only for a short retarget period or two. This
is especially the case given the current high levels of centralization
and validationless mining on the network today, which we would not want
to reward by making those miners the only ones effectively capable of
creating blocks until difficulty adjusted. I had not thought of this
aspect; thank you for bringing it up.

Yes, I very much don't like that aspect, which is why I made sure to
mention it.

I think having that code ready in general is a good idea, and a one-time
change in nBits is sounds like a good and simple way to go about it.

Thank you for your insightful reply,
