Remember that the attack described in the paper *doesn't* depend on the
ability to selectively block or even just slow down anything - it works
even on a unlimited bandwidth jam-free network so long as latency is
non-zero.

As for other possible attacks, if you can selectively block or slow down
certain near-target headers you haven't achieved anything novel. Why not
use that ability to block or slow down blocks themselves? Even if you
did block some PoW headers for whatever reason the original purpose of
broadcasting them - getting all hashing power to work to extend the same
block - is still achieved.
