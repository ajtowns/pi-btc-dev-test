Assuming Alice is paying Bob with an old style time-locked tx. Under your
proposal, after the hardfork, Bob is still able to confirm the time-locked
tx on both networks. To fulfil your new rules he just needs to send the
outputs to himself again (with different tx format). But as Bob gets all
the money on both forks, it is already a successful replay


Why would Alice be sitting on an old-style signed transaction with UTXO:s
none of which she controls (paying somebody else), with NO ability to
substitute the transaction for one where she DOES control an output,
leaving her unable to be the one spending the replay protecting child
transaction?
