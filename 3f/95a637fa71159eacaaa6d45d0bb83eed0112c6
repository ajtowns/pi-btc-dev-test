There have been no decent objections to altering the block-selection
mechanism (when two block solutions appear at nearly the same time) as
described at

http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/39226

Key components are:

   - Compute BitcoinDaysDestroyed using only transactions that have been in
   your mempool for some time as oBTCDD ("old BTCDD").
   - Use "nearly the same time" to mean separated in time by your guess of
   the average duration of block propagation times.
   - When two block solutions come in at nearly the same time, build on the
   one that has the most oBTCDD, rather than the one that came in first.

The goal of this change is to reduce the profitability of withholding block
solutions by severely reducing the chances that a block solved a while ago
can orphan one solved recently.  "Came in first" seems more easily gamed
than "most oBTCDD".  As I wrote there, "*old coins* is always a dwindling
resource and *global nodes willing to help cheat* is probably a growing
one."

I will write a BIP if anyone agrees it's a good idea.
