The spot price for ammonia fertilizer, refined gasoline at terminals, 
and price of tea in china are not 'public information', yet these are
some of the largest traded commodities in the world, far exceeding 
the drop in the bucket that all cryptocoin transactions make.

I'd further argue that the *actual* price of corn (cash bid price at
elevators and ethanol plants) is not public information either. There
is a great deal of money traded in collecting and then distributing the
'cleared price' information. Have a look at

You just made my long-term strategic argument for investing in my own
mining hardware so I can be sure to trade reliably.

People who take money from buyers and sellers care most about 'accurate 
historic market data'. I just want to exchange my corn for e85, fertilizer,
and electricity, and audit the code that runs accounting for the exchange.

I really don't give a shit if there is 'accurate historic market data' as
long as **MY** personal trade data is accurate and I got a good enough price,
and I know who I'm dealing with.

I know someone smarter than me and with more money, market leverage, and 
political connections **WILL** game the system and distort the market data
history so they can take more money from buyers and sellers without actually
doing some usefull market function. 

As long as use buyers and sellers can see the code, and have a good eye for
knowing when someone's pushing the market around, we can just put our orders
in and relieve some speculators of their money.

Just get me working code for cross-chain trades, and we'll work on the 
accurate historic data problem later.
