Yep.

Unfortunately the nodes accepting incoming connections are small
enough in number (7000?) that you can shut down a lot by attacking
those nodes.

This was part of the motivation of turning on upnp by default in the
GUI version, but maybe we need to go further than that...

Yes, that is correct.  Bitcoin resends wallet transactions with zero
confirmations, and both sent and received transactions fall within the
"wallet tx" superset.

TBH I had forgotten about the resend on the receiver side, though.
It, of course, makes plenty of sense in the context of importing
transactions from foreign sources, e.g. receiving transactions via a
USB flash drive.

Well, it -is- possible to implement TCP over UDP <grin>  The TCP
connection sequence over UDP helps to work against spoofing, while UDP
helps to open an inbound UDP port as you describe.

Not that I'm endorsing a bitcoin-internal TCP stack... just sayin'  :)
