You have to be seriously joking to call the bitcoin protocol elegant. A message based system over TCP with constantly changing endians that needs to lookup its own IP address on several websites is not elegant. It is functioning, not elegant.

Also it is kind of dick to come guns blaring and start insulting slush who runs one of the biggest mining pools and is working on electrum, and sipa who develops the satoshi bitcoin.

Namecoin has the same problem as DNS. From the document:

"The disadvantage of DNS TXT records is that updating a record takes 
time. This encourages people to not use new addresses per transaction 
which has certain security issues."

Its a negative example -- in that the IETF does not specify anything
in the PATH part of the URI. The scheme, sure, but not in the path,
there are many types of URI schemes ( start with RFC 2396 )

There is significant upside to having your own scheme and having apps
understand how to integrate with it. Frankly, having just one client
(I understand there are more) is an artifact that hinders acceptance
and participation. If you want to go the route of https then
specifying a scheme is your path forward

I still believe that it is experience that is leading this thread down
the rat-hole of CGI and HTTP requests. The stuff isn't magic, it is
just what you are used to. Review the bitcoin protocol, there is an
elegance there -- not found? in the https schemes proposed thus far.
CGI isn't a protocol, nor does it address usability/identity issues.

Providing a mapping from user at authority.tld addresses usability and
identity. I'd like to see an elegant transformation, specifically I
take to task anyone that advocates
https://authority/foo/user?tx=1zhd789632uilos as elegant.
