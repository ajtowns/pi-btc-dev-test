If you buy a TREZOR you will of course install the plugin :)

What I mean is that normal people are lazy : if the solution is already in
their hand they will use it, if they need to install/configure something,
they won't do it.

I'm not trying to propose a solution to solve the auth on the web, but to
ease the sign up / login on the Bitcoin ecosystem websites and apps.
More sign ups to new services (whatever the services) = more usage =
expanding ecosystem = more global value to Bitcoin

Wallets are a key element of the equation because :
- everyone has one (desktop or mobile)
- everyone (in theory) has already taken all steps to backup and secure
their keys
- id yourself with a Bitcoin address often makes sense on a Bitcoin related
service
