Just a small detail, but my tool actually looks up all the possible
combinations and then finds which one has been used before by looking for
past transactions on the blockchain. Therefore, it won't tell you your
phrase is correct unless it is a phrase that has actually been used before
(preventing what you described).

Using some algorithm to take some input and generate a bip39 phrase that
you can use with any bip39 wallet sounds perfectly reasonable.
