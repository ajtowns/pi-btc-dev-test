Hmm, is there any other way to do it? Can we provide a signed payment
request and verify the sign on receiving side and this way protect from
bluetooth MitM attack? Quick googling showed that SSL over bluetooth isn't
a very well developed area, and my own skills are not enough to quickly
implement a reliable secure solution here.
