And like last time we discussed this on the mailing list my opinion
differs from yours.
You talk about "real world sellers and buyers" but ignore Alice the
seller and Bob the buyer in my example.
You failed to explain how sybil attackers (Carol) get all those
margins. In my example I claim miners get them, what am I missing?
How is the same example with a proof-of-publication market any better?
Miners can reorder the orders with proof of publication too.
If getting orders into mined blocks faster has an advantage miners can
charge privileged traders for privileged connections (just like it
happens today with "perfectly fair" centralized markets today that
feature the high-frequency trading you mention).
They could even charge for moving transactions around within the same
block if that has any effect on the execution rules.
I prefer that miners can get the difference between bids and asks
directly to compensate for their hashing power.

The point is that there's more models for p2p markets beyond those
that require proof of publication for their orders, and you're
claiming that only those using proof of publication are secure.
That's incorrect.

Can you define "Accurate unbiased price information"?

Traders want to trade. The primary function of markets is exchange,
not price discovery.

"Provably fair price discovery" is probably impossible. But I can
imagine how many people could get excited about such a technology.
Can you formally define what you mean by this?
You see, "fair" implies morality and therefore it's a very subjective
term, so it's not obvious to me what you may mean by that.
