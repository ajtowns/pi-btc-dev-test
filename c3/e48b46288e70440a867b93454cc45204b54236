I think a warning like this is inappropriate.

There are many reasons to use an out of date operating system and high level applications like wallets need not concern themselves with the rest of the system.  Maybe the wallet can scan your browser cache and tell you to stop visiting somesite.com too?

It just sounds like some kind of behavior modification that's being discussed here.. not-so-subtly suggesting that users shell out money for a newer version of the operating system, just to use their bitcoin wallets in a 'blessed' configuration.  This actually sounds very similar to what happens with Apple iPhones.. they somehow manage to 'invalidate' the charging cables and accessories with every major software version.  One day an accessory is working fine, then after the update users get a behavior modification nag every time they use it, urging them to buy a new one.  Along these same lines, might as well put a warning about the registry keys needing to be cleaned, and maybe a 'shock the money' banner[1].

You guys all know how it works with financial software - there are many organizations using decades old software (and hardware) because they know its shortcomings, they've taken care of them in a way that works them, and they don't want to start all over just for the sake of having the newest version.
