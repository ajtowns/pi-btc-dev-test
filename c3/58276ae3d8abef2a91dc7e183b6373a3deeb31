With the way pruning works today my expirence is that virtually no one
sets any parameter other than the minimum, though even with that set a
few more blocks can be available.

In the future we would set further pruning identifying bits, with
those set node would (obviously) answer for their blocks.  An earlier
version of this BIP had such a bit defined but it appeared that we
lacked sufficient experience from practice to usefully specify what
height it should mean exactly and the proposals sounded like they
would likely interact poorly with other future proposals, so we
thought it better to delay defining any additional levels for the
time.

Part of your concern is mooted by the logistics of actually fetching
those additional blocks.  At least in the network today we have a
superabundance of nodes that serve anything, to handle them being rare
will require very different approaches than we have now.  We have no
reason to believe that "like the pruning thing but more blocks" is
actually all that useful-- and some reason to expect that its not:
once you go back more than a handful of weeks the probably of fetching
get pretty close to uniform, those fetches are only be newly
initializing nodes that need all the blocks.

That yields only 8 possibilities at the current chain size. A slightly better formula could take into account typical hard drive size increments, leaving enough space for the OS and other data. Node operators could opt-in to this if they think the increased fingerprint risk outweighs their desire to share archived blocks.
