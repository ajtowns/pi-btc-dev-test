Agreed.  I'm not suggesting that malleability shouldn't be fixed or isn't a
problem.  I would love to be able to leverage chained TX for Bitcoin
contracts.  But that in its current state it doesn't have to be complicated
to deal with  it.

Changing the protocol to use these static IDs is a pretty fundamental
change that would never happen in Bitcoin.   But they can still be useful
at the application level to mitigate these issues.
