We have had a spike in users reporting that their wallet isn't getting updated. To compound the problem, they rescan the blockchain and lose all of their transaction history. It has caused much panic among less technical users.

SPV Wallets should definitively update to respect NODE_BLOOM. Bloom
filtering is CPU and disk intense and some node operators have disabled
it (or will disabled it) because there is no direct p2p network-health
benefit.

SPV wallets should probably also make use of the new DNS seeder filter
option.
It is running at least on seed.bitcoin.sipa.be and
seed.bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch.

The filter option allows SPV Wallets to only get nodes that signal
support for NODE_BLOOM.

The syntax is

   x<networkservice_flags_filter_as_int>.seed.bitcoin....

Example for NODE_NETWORK together with NODE_BLOOM
dig x5.seed.bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch
(NETWORK = (1 << 0), NODE_BLOOM = (1 << 2)) = (bin00000101 = (int)5)
