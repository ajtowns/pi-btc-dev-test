Hello Eric,

I felt like I still owed you a response to the points below.

I think that's a false dichotomy. There is no reason why the P2P
network consists of purely servers (full nodes) and clients
(lightweight nodes). Where does a client fit that is SPV at startup,
but upgrades in the background to a full node? It seems strange that
such a client would use a 'client protocol' for initial connections,
but the P2P protocol for syncing with history, when both come from the
same peers, and transmit the same kind of information.

What would make sense IMHO is a protocol split between the different
kinds of transmission:
1) Historical block download
2) Block synchronization at the tip
3) Transaction relay
...

(1) prefers high bandwidth, has no connectivity concerns, and does not
care about latency and has no privacy concerns. (2) needs
partition-resistance, low latency and has also no privacy concerns.
(3) needs moderate latency, reliability of propagation and privacy.

If there were to be separate protocols for these, I would argue that
(3) should use opportunistic encryption always to increase transaction
source privacy, and (2) and (3) need authentication when one of the
peers is not fully validating.

BIP 150/151 give the tools to construct these.

My concern is not that it is required, but that it may grow significantly and will have a tendency to gravitate towards more effective registration mechanisms for what is a "good" peer. Even an informal but pervasive web of trust may make it difficult for untrusted parties to connect.

Maybe, but I'm very unconvinced that that will happen more than how
today IP and DNS-based "authentication" is used already (in very
inadvisable ways).

You're very right to point out that this does not give you protection from active attackers, and that active attacking is relatively easy through sybil attacks. I still prefer my attacker to actually do that over just listening in on my connection.

> I agree, and I doubt this proposal will have much impact on an advanced persistent threat, or even lesser threats. People should understand that there is both a risk and a limited benefit to this proposal.

I believe the risk is only in misunderstanding what it is good for,
and there significant benefits to a network that encrypts connections
by default, as it excludes purely passive attackers.

> I believe you have misinterpreted my comments on distributed anonymous credentials (and the like) as commentary on the construction of BIP151 (and a subsequent auth proposal). As such your observation that it is exaggerated would make sense, but it is not what I intended. Encryption and auth are straightforward. Preventing bad nodes from participating in an anonymous distributed system is not.

Preventing bad nodes from participating is a very hard problem, if not
impossible. That doesn't mean we can't improve the current situation:
people are relying on node identity already, and doing so in ways that
have unclear attack vectors (IP spoofing, DNS poisoning, BGP routing
attacks). Adding optional and non-discoverable cryptographic
identities can improve this.
