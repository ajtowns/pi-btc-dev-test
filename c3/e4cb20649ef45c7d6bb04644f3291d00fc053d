You'd need to run your own email server and/or change email address, which
is not in the reach of the average user, and maybe not even of some
businesses.

You can self sign X.509 certificates quite easily (e.g. one click via
<KEYGEN>), then rely on a decentralized web of trust to remove browser
warnings.  A few people are working on this.

It is easier to use, that's a great plus.  But convenience is often a trade
off with security.

I dont user user at host, I use my home page because it's easy to dereference
and get a public key.  Email is hard to dereference.

Yes, there is a reliance on DNS, which Tim calls the 'Achilles heel' of the
web, but it's held up quite well so far (fortunately for us).

Mozilla also have a master key to most email accounts, so if anyone got
access to that they could impersonate the vast majority of users that have
not opted in.  I would not use persona for financial stuff, but if I made a
casual app with non sensitive information it would be one of the top
choices, imho
