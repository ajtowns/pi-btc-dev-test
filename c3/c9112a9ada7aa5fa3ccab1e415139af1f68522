There's a solution to both of these problems..

If you want a really reliable time source, use at least three block chains and
make sure they all agree within an hour.

Well, being as how I don't trust Bitcoin anyway because it includes SSL, yes,
you could get 'bitcoin-level' trust.

But if you actually want something secure, you look at the altcoin space
which solved the mining decentralization problem when Litecoin came out, 
and this also solves the having to trust a single source code base. There
is lots of code diversity out there in altcoins, and what appears to me to
be a really strong cryptographically sound time source, but only if you use
multiple diverse sources.
