Checkpoints will be replaced by compiled-in 'at THIS timestamp the main chain had THIS much proof of work.'

That is enough information to prevent attacks and still allow optimizations like skipping signature checking for ancient transactions.

I don't think anybody is proposing replacing checkpoints with nothing.
