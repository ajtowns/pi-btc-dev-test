Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin is an experiment. Why don't we have an
	experimental hardfork?

I?m 100% in favor of attempting a hard fork using a far less controversial, far less risky consensus rule change. We should stop wasting our energy arguing over stuff we don?t really know and understand and can?t predict very well - and we should especially avoid using a highly contentious change as our first hard fork deployment.

I?m also in favor of trying a small block increase before attempting any major jumps. I don?t think we should be focusing so much on long-term block size adjustment rules right now - much more critical is to develop a hard fork mechanism and to make sure we can deploy it. So something along these lines is probably a step in the right direction.

At the same time, exploration for a better solution continues. If no further consensus could be reached, a new version of Bitcoin Core with the patch will be released on or before 1 Feb 2016 and everyone will be asked to upgrade immediately.
