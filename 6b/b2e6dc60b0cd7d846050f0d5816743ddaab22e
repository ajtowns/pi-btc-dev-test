 >None of this is a reason why the size can't increase. However, in my 
opinion, we should do it because we believe it increases utility and 
understand the risks; not because we're afraid of what might happen if 
we don't hurry up. And from that point of view, it seems silly to make a 
huge increase at once...

Yes.  I think people/businesses want some kind of assurance that there 
is a path to get things done when needed rather than immediate changes.  
Since there is currently no clear path/schedule to get any changes 
accomplished they gets anxious.
