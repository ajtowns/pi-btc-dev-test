Please don't bring locale into this. Bitcoin has always been intentionally 
locale-independent (hence BTC using xxx,xxx,xxx.xx format even in locales 
which swap the commas and periods). Localising display makes different locales 
more or less incompatible at a human level, even if they use the same 
blockchain.
