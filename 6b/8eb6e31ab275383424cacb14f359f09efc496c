This entire discussion is recycled.  Please review the previous
discussion, before asking the same questions over again.

Properly done, there are FEWER hurdles.  In the previous discussion,
there was outlined a process whereby the BIPS Editor would receive an
email, and could take it from there.  No wiki login or bitcoin payment
required.  More advanced users may submit pull requests.

Compared with a hash-sealed git repo as primary source, the wiki is
second class.
