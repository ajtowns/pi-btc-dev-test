Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin v0.3.24 released
Message-ID: <CA+8xBpcNx7ffKCj6HEdTmK2S+AORcZen+dfAtZyzz3fQ44+PHg@mail.gmail.com>

Bitcoin v0.3.24 is now available for download at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.24/

This is another bug fix release.  We had hoped to have wallet
encryption ready for release, but more urgent fixes for existing
clients were needed -- most notably block download problems were
getting severe.  Wallet encryption is ready for testing at
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/352 for the git-savvy, and
-hopefully- will follow shortly in the next release, v0.4.

Notable fixes in v0.3.24, and the main reasons for this release:

F1) Block downloads were failing or taking unreasonable amounts of
time to complete, because the increased size of the block chain was
bumping up against some earlier buffer-size DoS limits.
F2) Fix crash caused by loss/lack of network connection.

Notable changes in v0.3.24:

C1) DNS seeding enabled by default.
C2) UPNP enabled by default in the GUI client.  The percentage of
bitcoin clients that accept incoming connections is quite small, and
that is a problem.  This should help.  bitcoind, and unofficial
builds, are unchanged (though we encourage use of "-upnp" to help the
network!)
C3) Initial unit testing framework.  Bitcoin sorely needs automated
tests, and this is a beginning.  Contributions welcome.
C4) Internal wallet code cleanup.  While invisible to an end user,
this change provides the basis for v0.4's wallet encryption.
