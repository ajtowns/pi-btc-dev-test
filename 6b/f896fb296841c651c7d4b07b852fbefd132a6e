As was already pointed out, yes. However this requires them to immediate
establish a majority consensus and be absolutely sure it really is the
majority. You suggest an out of band mechanism for that, but why is this
better than using the actual consensus mechanism you're trying to measure?

Bitcoin imposes far more rules than just execution of the scripting
language, many of which are entirely arbitrary and the result of
(controversial) human judgement, like the inflation schedule. You can't
claim Bitcoin implements only some kind of natural law.
