It would be nice to decouple the venue, but even BIP 1 gives that
control to whoever controls the mailing list: "Following a discussion,
the proposal should be sent to the bitcoin-dev list and the BIP editor
with the draft BIP." (BIP 1)

A neater way to do it might be to replace references to the mailing list
with "public discussion medium" where "medium" can be defined as
something like any discussion forum frequented by the wider development
community, like the pull requests section of the BIP repo, conferences, etc.
