As it has been disabled in relevant software I think it's mostly symbolic at
this point, but yes, it makes sense to 'officially' retire the key. Let's
pin the date and make it widely known.

Doing this in organized fashion is much better than the whodunit that would
undoubtly follow when the key would simply leak, which could happen at any
time, as no one can know who it has spread to over all those years.

Re: timing, I'd say leave three months grace time after this announcement for
altcoins and such that may have accidentally have copied it to remove it, then
at the beginning of 2017 broadcast the final alert.

After that it's neutered, it's up to each of us that has the key to reveal it
or not or when. It's a historical curiosity then.
