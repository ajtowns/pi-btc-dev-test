Zander is working on the same thing: https://www.reddit.com/r/AetheralResearch/

But it's actually quite difficult to make it truly censorship-resistant: both in solving the theymos factor and spam/abuse/overloading as an attack.

We have /r/bitcoinxt and so far it has been great. But we also need a regular forum.

Roger Ver controls bitcoin.com, as I understand? https://bitcoin.com/forum/ would be nice.

And it must be a real community, not "say whatever you want because free speech". We've seen how that turned out to be.

Something like battle.net or Steam forums: heavily moderated, not for opinions, but for spam/noise/insults.

Again, this needs leadership. Anyone can install a forum software, what is needed is an "official seal of approval" and regular presence of top XT people there.

And a will to setup proper moderation. Then people will move.
