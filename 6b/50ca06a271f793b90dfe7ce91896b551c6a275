I wanted to have a look at how the whole Bitcoin thing works recently. 
Being a distributed application, I've searched for the protocol spec. 
What I found were two wiki pages (Protocol & ProtocolRules) that looked 
more like notes someone wrote down while implementing the application.

Have I missed something? Is there any effort underway trying to produce 
a decent spec? If not so, I am willing to help with that.
