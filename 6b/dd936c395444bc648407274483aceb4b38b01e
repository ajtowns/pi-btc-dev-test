Would there be an objection to making op_return outputs with two
pushdatas standard (same max data size)?

Use case is mostly tagging transactions so they can be returned by bloom
filtering nodes:

OP_RETURN <tag> <data>

Since bip37 nodes test each data element in each output script (which I
believe applies to op_return as well?) it provides a lightweight way of
fetching transactions where the tag matches a specific pattern.

It appears a sizable number of nodes/miners already accept such
transactions as this one was mined in the first block...
