Some people/person went and actually started making substantive edits
to the text.
The text it's rolled back to is missing the last copyedits from last night too.

The text that had been ACKed last night was a3e52973,  available at

As far as the PGP goes?

I think using the PGP is good: it's making use of the right tools,
avoids issues like we just had where people go changing the content
after names had been affixed,  shows solidarity with people building
security infrastructure that our ecosystem depends on.  If you only
use it occasionally then its easy for someone to strip it when it _is_
needed and disguise that just as regular non-use.  It's my general
view that for people working in our domain basic competence and use of
these tools, even when they kinda stink, is a kind of civic hygiene.

At the same time it's not urgent. It's poorly used by people and will
be ignored by most but packagers are the most frequent users of it
that I've encountered.  Fortunately, it's harmless in any case.

If people are interested in offering PGP signatures of it:

wget http://luke.dashjr.org/tmp/code/20130723-linux-distribution-packaging-and-bitcoin.md
gpg --clearsign 20130723-linux-distribution-packaging-and-bitcoin.md

and post the little signature asc. The result composes nicely:
