We can certainly imagine many BIP70 extensions, but for things like
auto-filling shipping addresses, is the wallet the best place to do it? My
browser already knows how to fill out this data in credit card forms, it
would make sense to reuse that for Bitcoin.

It sounds like you want a kind of Star-Trek negotiation agent thing, where
your computer knows how to seek out the best deal because all the metadata
is standardised. Such a thing would be an interesting project, but it's
probably not best done in BIP70 given how it's deployed and used today.
Rather, I'd suggest looking at the various HTML5 data standards which would
allow merchants to advertise things like where they ship to in a machine
readable and crawlable form.
