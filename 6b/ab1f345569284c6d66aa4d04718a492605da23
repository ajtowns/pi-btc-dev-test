None of those solutions are compatible with decentralized networks for a
lot of reasons. Given the inability to prevent sybil attacks your
suggestions lead to people being unfairly punished for poor connectivity
that may be entirely out of their control. They also make maintaining a
Bitcoin node and mining the blockchain require a significant amount of
hands on maintenance, again incompatible with a decentralized system.
