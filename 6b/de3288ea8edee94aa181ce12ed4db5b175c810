Instead of a payment request and refund, businesses would actually need a payment channel, that once established allows for multiple payments back and forth between counterparties.

One might have a number of open channels until the business relationship is assumed. The customer might decide to close the channel explicitelly once he does no longer expect a payment.

BIP 70 has an expiry field for PaymentRequests that we can use to allow us to eventually stop loading those keys into RAM - at that point payments to those keys would no longer be recognised. But there's no equivalent for refund addresses.

Otherwise a wallet has to be looking out for refunds for payments you may have made years ago. So perhaps we should add a new refund field that embeds a PaymentDetails structure instead of being just a list of outputs.

So key expiry seems pretty fundamental to scalability.
