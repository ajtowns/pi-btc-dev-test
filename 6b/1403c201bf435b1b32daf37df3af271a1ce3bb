Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Masked bits and isStandard
Message-ID: <CAGLBAhcW2Av7X92LjXk+SjK+Dj4Hw4VapGSoiKQggE6wi4r0kg@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks again.  The description of bits 16..29 as "can take any value"
suggests to me an improvement for isStandard: if any bits "can take any
value" without affecting the script then they must be off for the script to
pass isStandard.

If I understand it correctly, this requirement will serve as a backup to
future uses of those bits if such uses are deployed as soft forks.

I'm sorry if my suggestion reflects a poor understanding of isStandard, but
I offer it as evidence on whether the mechanism is as well understood as it
should be, since we use soft forks.  If I have misunderstood, feel free to
educate me with a reply.

Thanks!
