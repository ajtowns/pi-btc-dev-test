Hi Jorge,

I'm glad we seem to be reaching agreement that hard forks aren't so bad
really and can even have advantages. It seems the remaining area of
disagreement is this rollout specifically.

Indeed it will, but the point of fully verifying is to *not* converge with
the miner majority, if something goes wrong and they aren't following the
same rules as you. Defining "work" as "converge with miner majority" is
fine for SPV wallets and a correct or at least reasonable definition. But
not for fully verifying nodes, where non-convergence is an explicit design
goal! That's the only thing that stops miners awarding themselves infinite
free money!

No, I'm focused on the block size issue right now. I don't think there's
much point in improving the block chain protocol if most users are going to
be unable to use it. But the modification is simple, right? You just
replace this bit:

  CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY redefines the existing NOP2 opcode

with this

  CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY defines a new opcode (0xc0)

and that's it. The section *upgrade and testing plan* only says TBD so that
part doesn't even need to change at all, as it's not written yet.
