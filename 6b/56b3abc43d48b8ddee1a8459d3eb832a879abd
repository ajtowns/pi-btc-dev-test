Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Improvement to the Test Framework in the
	processing of test blocks
Message-ID: <53EA73FD.6070005@certimix.com>

We've coded and tested changes to the Bitcoin testing framework to allow
the creation and processing of blocks in unit test cases in order to
test ProcessBlock(), CheckBlock(), ActivateBestChain(),
ActivateBestChainStep() and ConnectTip(), including block-chain
reorganizations, majority rules, block version changes and more.
Several new test cases were added to enrich the test suite.
