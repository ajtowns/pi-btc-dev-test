Subject: [bitcoin-dev] [BIP draft] Flexible Offer and Acceptance Smart
	Contract
Message-ID: <CABFP+yP8dNtW_msv+k2ZogHgBwm2WH1MYW5-JTDoMPMGLFyxaQ@mail.gmail.com>

I first submitted this idea as an example usage for BIP65.
The feedback was that this might be large enough to be a BIP on its own.
So, I'm submitting here for review and feedback.

In short, this informational BIP describes two Bitcoin script constructs
that utilize the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode to create a smart contract that
allows a specific offer, with flexible expiration time, to be presented and
either accepted (optionally into escrow), or withdrawn/rejected.

The BIP draft can be found at:

An small example usage implementation can be found at:
