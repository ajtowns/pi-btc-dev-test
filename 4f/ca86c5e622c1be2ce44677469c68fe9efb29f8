IMHO it already is.  A node requests a filter using filterinit by
specifying the false positive rate it wants and a guessed number of
items.  The node which will have to hold that filter then responds with
the closest filter to what the SPV node requested that it is willing to
provide.  If the SPV node responds with a filterload command, it has
accepted the offer, otherwise it will simply disconnect and find a
better full node.  
I'd much rather have an overloaded node respond with 50% fp rate filters
as an option if there aren't many full nodes available than simply
disconnect SPV clients.
At least thats my thinking, but you may be right that it is too heavy
for too little gain.
