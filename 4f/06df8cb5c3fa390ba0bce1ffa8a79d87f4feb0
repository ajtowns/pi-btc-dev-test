Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Why SegWit Anyway?
Message-ID: <CAAQs3wuDPktHc6kiZXqTaatOheX4KP=TRgje0_-ED5h8iNs-MA@mail.gmail.com>

Bitcoin Noob here. Please forgive my ignorance.

>From what I understand, in SegWit, the transaction needs to be serialized
into a data structure that is different from the current one where
signatures are separated from the rest of the transaction data.

Why change the format at all? Why cant we just compute the Transaction ID
the same way the hash for signing the transaction is computed?
