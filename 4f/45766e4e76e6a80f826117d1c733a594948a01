I'd hope that the incentives are in place to encourage high volume senders
to be more efficient in their use of block space by batching transactions
and implementing SegWit, though this may not be the case for providers that
pass transaction fees along to their users.

We've been trying to be more proactive about outreach regarding efficient
use of block space to our own customers at BitGo - when we break down the
cost savings of implementing a new technique, it generally helps to hasten
their adoption. I suspect that in many cases this is an issue of education
- we should be more proactive in calling out inefficient uses of block
space.
