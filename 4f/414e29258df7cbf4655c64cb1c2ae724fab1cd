"10% say literally never.  That seems like a significant disenfranchisement
and lack of consensus."

Certainly the poll results should be taken with a grain of salt and not a definitive answer or measure . 
However if we agree the poll has some worth (or even if not, then lets use it as hyptothetical): If we split it into two groups: those okay with a hardfork at some point > now, and those never okay with hardfork, that means there is 90% that agree a hardfork is acceptable in the future. That said, what threshold defines consensus then? 98%? 100%?       
 
Personally I think pursuing paths that maximize net social benefit in terms of cost surplus/burden is the best way to go since consensus is such an impossible to define, variable, case-by-case thing that doesn't always lead to the best choice.

10% say literally never.  That seems like a significant disenfranchisement
and lack of consensus.
