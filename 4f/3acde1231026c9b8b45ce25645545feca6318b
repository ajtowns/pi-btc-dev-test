We use coinbase sigs to gauge the safety of enforcing a soft fork
several times and not just for P2SH, to determine when enforcement of
it will be decisive and not result in risking a partition in the
network that might permit transaction reversals. This is not voting.
As a feature decision mechanism his is a rather coercive thing because
it gives the highest hash-power bidders control even when their
interests may be rather thoroughly unaligned with population that owns
and uses bitcoin in general, but as a plain indicator of when its safe
to enforce a new rule (same mechanism, different motivation? though a
point is that safe usage means using much more than 50% as the
threshold) it works pretty well.

Yes, making really distributed systems that work in a complex world is
hard. It certantly would be /easier/ to just declare miners "trusted
parties" and require them to always collude to produce a single
consensus view of the world that is always honest and never
contradictory, except that it doesn't work. Because they aren't
individually trusted or even trustworthy.

Temporarily censoring transactions by orphaning otherwise valid blocks
that contain them for as long as you retain a majority is possible and
impossible to prevent in this architecture. This isn't the same as
deleting.  Deleting suggests the common misconception that a majority
of miners can do anything they want.
