Keep in mind that Andresen and Hearn both propose that the majority of
Bitcoin users, even businesses, abandon the global consensus technology
aspect of Bitcoin - running full nodes - and instead adopt trust
technology instead - running SPV nodes.

We're very much focused on meeting the demand for global consensus
technology, but unfortunately global consensus is also has inherently
O(n^2) scaling with current approaches available. Thus we have a fixed
capacity system where access is mediated by supply and demand
transaction fees.

Solutions like (hub-and-spoke) payment channels, Lightning, etc. allow
users of the global consensus technology in Bitcoin to use that
technology in much more effcient ways, leveraging a relatively small
amount of global consensus to do large numbers of transactions
trustlessly.
