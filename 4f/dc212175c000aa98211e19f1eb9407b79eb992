That was exactly matejcik's point; you can easily write protobuf-compatible
encoder/decoder for such simple structure in about an afternoon, if you
need. Or you can use existing protobuf parsers in matter of minute, if you
don't care about dependencies.

Also, many projects already have protobuf parsers, so it work in other way,
too; you need BIP174 parser as extra dependency/library, although you
already use protobuf library (like Trezor device does). For needs of
BIP174, the difference between ad-hoc format and protobuf is neglible, so
it is a mistake to introduce yet another format.
