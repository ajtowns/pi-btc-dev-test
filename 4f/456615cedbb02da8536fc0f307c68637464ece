I predict this would be a disaster. UTXO storage is CONSENSUS-CRITICAL code.
Any divergence in implementation behaviour, including bugs AND bugfixes, may 
cause consensus failure. For this to have a reasonable *hope* of working, we 
need to choose one storage engine, and *will* need to maintain consensus-
compatibility of it ourselves (since nobody else cares).

Fixing LevelDB frankly seems like an easier task than switching to anything 
SQL-based, which would require a *lot* more *difficult-to-get-consensus-
compatible* code that we are all (or at least mostly) very unfamiliar with.

Research is fine, but let's be realistic about deployment.
