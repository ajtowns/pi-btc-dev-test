Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Testnet under attack?
Message-ID: <CABaLYCufS4pW644S9q63YfZNECtRW5jhJRw3-vozNz1=N50oHQ@mail.gmail.com>

It appears that someone is minting new blocks literally every couple of
seconds on the testnet chain right now.

You can see it on both blockexplorer:
   http://blockexplorer.com/testnet

and also btclook:
  http://testnet.btclook.com/

Is this something we should worry about?

thanks,
Mike
