By itself, this wouldn't work without a way for a new node to differentiate
between a false history and a true one.

This might work, but I fail to understand how a new node could verify an
address / transaction without a blockchain to back it.  Even if it could,
it becomes dependent upon those addresses not being compromised, and the
owners of those addresses would become targets for potential government
operations.

Having the software silently attempt to resolve the problem is risky unless
it is foolproof.  Otherwise, users will assume their software is showing
them the correct history/numbers implicitly, and if the change the utxo
attacker made was small, the users might be able to follow the main chain
totally until it was too late and the attacker struck with an address that
otherwise never transacted.  Sudden, bizarre, hard to debug fork and
potentially double spend against people who picked up the fraudulent utxo.

Users already treat wallet software with some level of suspicion, asking if
they can trust x or y or z, or like the portion of the BU community
convinced that core has been compromised by blockstream bigwigs.  Signed
releases could provide the same thing but would encourage both open-source
security checks of the signed utxo's and potentially of users to check
download signatures.

Either approach is better than what we have now though, so I'd support
anything.
