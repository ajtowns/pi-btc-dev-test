Let me make a sacrilegious proposal: keep using the name "bitcoin", and
shift the decimal point.

There would be a short adaption period, where people will need to talk
about "new bitcoins" and "old bitcoins" in order to disambiguate them.
However, Bitcoin users are techies, so I don't think that the ambiguity
will be a big issue. I don't think lots of people will mistakenly send
1000 times more than the amount they intended.

The name "bitcoin" has a huge advantage over any other proposal, because
it is already established. No marketing is needed.

This kind of renaming has already taken place many times in history,
because the currency was debased. Bitcoin would be the first time it
happens in the other direction.
