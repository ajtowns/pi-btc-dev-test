Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Scalability issues
Message-ID: <CAD2Ti29dqCYoOMcX0zcOQnpLGCxnCjYHHqMzyyq+hvcVQ2c7nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Given a testbed: Pentium 4 1.8GHz single core, 2GB ram, FreeBSD 8,
disk is geli aes-128 + zfs sha-256, bitcoin 0.6.3, Tor proxy,
An estimate is made that by the end of the year bitcoin will
completely overrun the capabilities of this reasonable class of
machines.
It already takes a month to build a new blockchain, let alone keep up
with new incoming blocks.
Yes, it also has workstation duties, yet even if those were removed,
it would probably choke by mid 2013.

It would appear bitcoin has some *serious* scalability hurdles coming
down the road.
Most certainly if the user expects to independantly build, manage, and
trust their own blockchain.
