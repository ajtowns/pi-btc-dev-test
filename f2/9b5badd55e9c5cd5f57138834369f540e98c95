Your own wallet can look up the exchange rate and compare it to what you're
getting (and in fact, wallets do!).

Besides, assuming the customer is *always* being scammed seems extreme.
There are plenty of merchants that genuinely care about their reputation
and genuinely want people to pay with Bitcoin so they can avoid card fees.

I'll probably draft a BIP for this next week or so.
