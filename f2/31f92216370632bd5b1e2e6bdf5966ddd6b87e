I think there's a significant risk to not having it at this stage.  
There's many reasons why an urgent update may been to rapidly propagated 
in this stage of the network's lifecycle.  Perhaps if there's a 
perceived threat of abuse the protocol could be altered slightly so it 
can't carry content.  Only a notification of the fact that there is an 
alert.  Then it would be up to individual clients whether they react to 
it or not.  The main clients would probably check a central trusted 
server for actual alert content.  This would give a lot more flexibility 
in how to deal with the alert.  Alert content servers could for example 
implement a json api to provide alert content with meta data like target 
client version, priority etc.

I think it should be removed in the future but not for a good while yet.
