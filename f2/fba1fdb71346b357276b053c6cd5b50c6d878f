Subject: [Bitcoin-development] MtGox blames bitcoin
Message-ID: <CANAnSg1LgpHGf-vTV0to1Z7sogf1ic6WTbogEsrQy1wh4C5zfw@mail.gmail.com>

What is the official response from the Bitcoin Core developers about
MtGox's assertion that their problems are due to a fault of bitcoin, as
opposed to a fault of their own?

The technical analysis preluding this mess, was that MtGox was at fault for
their faulty wallet implementation.
