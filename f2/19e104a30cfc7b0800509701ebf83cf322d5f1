Probably the simplest way to do this is to map the new-rules coinbase tx 
(which collects the block reward and fees) into an old-rules legacy 
coinbase tx (which collects the block reward only).  Care must be taken 
to ensure the mapping is not reversible.  I will update my 
implementation in due course.
