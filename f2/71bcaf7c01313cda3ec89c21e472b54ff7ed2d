Hello again,

I've reworked this idea a bit as alluded to previously.  The key highlights
of Numerifides are now:

- Transaction is a normal transaction paying to a script hash with a
CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY encumbrance.
- Users "mine" their registrations to produce TXIDs with Proof of Work
attached (providing for a way to secure and "commandeer" names).
- Secondary network for gossiping name->data mappings, that is rooted from
the numerifide transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.

The "mining" is done simply by incrementing a nonce in the registration
data (off-chain).  This prevents "namesquatting" like we see on Namecoin.

There is an easy formula that uses the Timelock, Proof of Work and amount
of Bitcoin locked that determines which transactions are authoritative for
a given name mapping.

Feedback and criticism appreciated,
Tyler
