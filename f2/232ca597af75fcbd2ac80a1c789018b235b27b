Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Ubuntu LTS Packaging?
Message-ID: <53494CFF.1030303@olivere.de>

Hello,

so far, nothing yet?

See: https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/

I'm developing currently a LiveCD for hot/cold wallet management on
Ubuntu LTS basis. For critical vulnerabilities I have to provide timely
updates. I have now decided to maintain my own repository for this
project. If there are better alternatives, let me know.

regards
Oliver
