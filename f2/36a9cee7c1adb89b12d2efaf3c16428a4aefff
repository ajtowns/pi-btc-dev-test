That is a good observation that most of the historical data does not need
to be kept around. I believe what you are suggested is already implemented,
however. Bitcoin Core can operate in a pruned mode, where the bulk of the
historical block data is discarded and only the current UTXO set (and a few
recent blocks) are kept. As you note, some nodes on the network need to run
in archive mode to help new nodes get in sync. BIP 159 helps identify these
archive nodes at the gossip layer.

In the case of lightning, some implementations made use of the additional
txindex, which is not compatible with pruned mode.
