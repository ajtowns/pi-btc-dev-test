Can't this be solved with a single update to the address format,
allowing a tx version number to be part of the address serialization? 
Then the sending software will apply that version to the payment tx.   
Of course, I'm not sure if allowing nodes to create transactions with
version numbers outside of their programming is safe.  It seems like it
should be since we're talking about soft forks anyway, but there's
probably some subtleties I'm overlooking.
