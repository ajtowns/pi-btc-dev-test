Your reply has nothing to do with my comment.  It looks like you just go 
around posting wing nut stuff without regard to what is being discussed. 
  A proper threat model considers all possible threats and looks at the 
probability of each.

Obviously from your comment you have no experience in threat models and 
limited education in general.
