When you say that you don't think it is possible to solve, do you mean that
there is a specific problem with this proposal of replacing transactions
when offered a new transaction whose fee rate exceeds the package fee rate
of the original transaction (and ensuring that the fee increase covers the
size of the transactions being ejected)?  Is your concern only about the
ability to computing and track the package fee rate for transactions within
the mempool or is there some other issue you foresee?
