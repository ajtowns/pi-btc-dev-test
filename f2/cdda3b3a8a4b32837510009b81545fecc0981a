Fine, but, before the roadmap itself, I wrote exactly about why I
thought we should update it. Evidently you disagree with the horse, but
it is in front of the cart where it belongs.

It isn't a "roadmap" anymore -- I changed it to a "forecast".

And I edited the drivechain part to emphasize only that mainchain space
would likely be freed as defectors leave for an alt-chain. The departing
individuals (ir hardcore LargeBlockers) will leave, despite a
security-model NACK from anyone here (in fact, it would probably only
encourage them). That leaves more space for those who remain.

Drivechain  (c. bitcointalk Feb 2014, blog Nov 2015) is actually much
older than "the" SegWit to which you refer.  As for being "conservative"
and "flexible", I have tried to do everything I know -- Scaling
conferences, in-person discussions, papers, posts, and presentations,
adding BMM, and posting here for additional peer review. I'm sure you
have lots of ideas about how it could be more conservative and/or
flexible, which I would love to hear.

But again I think people are getting hung up on the drivechain part --
it can be easily taken out, I just thought that, if the plan included
more overall flexibility for industry, then it would help deter network
splits and scaling drama.
