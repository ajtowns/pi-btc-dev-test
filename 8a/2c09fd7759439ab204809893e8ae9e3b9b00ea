Its a negative example -- in that the IETF does not specify anything
in the PATH part of the URI. The scheme, sure, but not in the path,
there are many types of URI schemes ( start with RFC 2396 )

There is significant upside to having your own scheme and having apps
understand how to integrate with it. Frankly, having just one client
(I understand there are more) is an artifact that hinders acceptance
and participation. If you want to go the route of https then
specifying a scheme is your path forward

I still believe that it is experience that is leading this thread down
the rat-hole of CGI and HTTP requests. The stuff isn't magic, it is
just what you are used to. Review the bitcoin protocol, there is an
elegance there -- not found  in the https schemes proposed thus far.
CGI isn't a protocol, nor does it address usability/identity issues.

Providing a mapping from user at authority.tld addresses usability and
identity. I'd like to see an elegant transformation, specifically I
take to task anyone that advocates
https://authority/foo/user?tx=1zhd789632uilos as elegant.
