To add a timeout a user can optionally bundle a pair of similar
transactions.  One with the transaction version bits set and a second with
a locktime set.  The effect is the same.

My formal condition does include a check for the block version (I've
corrected the constants below):

(txVersion & 0xe0000000 != 0x200000000) || (*(blkVersion & 0xe0000000 =
0x200000000)* && (blkVersion & txVersion = txVersion))

Nothing here prevents upgrading versionbits AFAICT.  Any txVersion that
does not begin with 0b001 is unconditionally acceptable and available for
further soft-forking.
