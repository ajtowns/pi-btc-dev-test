But what is that for? You said it's for a lightweight client to do
that when it receives a transaction, to verify that all the
dependencies are in blocks recursively. But why?

Well, it's more efficient to just verify the merkle branch. But yes.

Why do you need all of them? You just care about the ones sending
coins to you, surely?

IMHO it's fine to introduce new commands. They'll just be ignored by
old clients in any event.
