As soon as there is competition for block space, people will likely
outsource creating the proof of work on the transaction to "transaction
miners". This would likely result in giving a fee to those transaction
miners. If those are the same miners as those mining the block, we are back
at the current system.

Put in other words: We are already doing this, you are paying the miner for
a piece of the proof of work of the block. If you want to mine instead of
paying, just mine a block and use a part of the block reward to pay the fee
for another transaction.

This also does not work to prevent spam. Instead of paying the transaction
fee you can just pay someone to mine proof-of-work on your spam
transactions, resulting in roughly the same cost. There is no reason a
normal user would be better in doing this than a spammer, likely it is the
other way around as the spammer is a more reliable customer for a miner.
