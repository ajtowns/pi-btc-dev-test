Sounds awesome!

Pieter told me at lunch that headers first cut sync time to 45 minutes for
him, which is another amazing improvement from the master of optimisations.

Pieter, Matt and I also agreed that for maximum impact we should really try
to ship payment protocol support in at least two clients simultaneously and
ideally with a big merchant signed up too - to send a powerful message that
we really mean it. Someone volunteered last week to do it for bitcoinj and
if he doesn't pull through, I have some old code from EOY 2012 that I could
update to the latest spec and ship at least some basic support. I'd hope
that we can get Bitcoin Wallet or MultiBit updates out once bcj has support
pretty fast.

Also, Jeff said that BitPay want to be a leader in support for the
protocol. So let's try and co-ordinate release dates so we can make a bit
of a splash and grab the ecosystems attention.

Sounds brilliant. It'll be nice to see the pull request queue drain. Any
ideas what the non-0.9 code will be? Fee rework? DoS work?
