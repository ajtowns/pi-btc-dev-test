It has been merged. There is the "importaddress" RPC call, which works
the same as "importprivkey" except that you a pass it an address.

Yes - aim is in a few months, probably by the end of the year.

AFAIK there are no nightly builds at this moment. Warren Togami was
building them for a while (at http://nightly.bitcoin.it/) but he
stopped some time around June.

It's not recommended to use master without at least a little bit of
development/debugging experience of yourself (to trace down problems
when they appear), so it's best to build it yourself if you're going
to test day-to-day development versions.
