Bitcoins stands or falls with people running full nodes.

If no one wants to volunteer resources to support the network anymore,
we'll have failed.

Sorry. I don't think it will ever make sense to run full nodes on consumer

Most consumer hardware is much more powerful than 'cheap virtualized
servers'. More memory, disks are cheap, and at least in the Netherlands
home bandwidth is much cheaper than server bandwidth.

Also: any optimization that helps running on cheap servers will also help
running it on consumer hardware. It's not the one or the other.
