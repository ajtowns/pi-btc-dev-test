Bech32 is just a replacement for Base58. It's not strictly SegWit related. If I understand correctly the only reason it won't be used for legacy addresses is to prevent confusion:

Regarding size I'm mostly curious how big it is on a screen or a physical paper, as text, not as a QR code. This would involve deserializing the protobuf and rendering the result in bech32.

I does sound like there's overlap between BIP-70 and BIP-173 that should be resolved.

Perhaps any payment request can be rendered as bech32 and any bech32 address can converted to a payment request. Maybe only for a limited set of fields (address, expiration, amount). This would be a matter of agreeing how the protobuf should be serialized and deserialized. In that case the protobuf would not contain the literal bech32 address as a string, but instead it would contain the underlying data (public key / script hash, network, etc).
