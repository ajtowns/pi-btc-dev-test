I believe he explained very well what he meant by decentralized, please
stop suggesting he doesn't understand his own thoughts: it is extremely
irritating.

For starters, a third party (or a recuded group of miners controlling the
majority of the hashrate) can censor transactions. It doesn't matter how
benevolent that party is: it can be forced to do it by the laws of its
jurisdiction.

If you don't care about this, I suggest you start a new system without
expensive proof of work, you can replace it with block signing (it can
still be multisig). It is already coded, just fork the alpha or the
blocksigning branch in elementsProject (github).
