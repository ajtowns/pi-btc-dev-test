Normal GitHub users submitting pull-reqs to Bitcoin Core can't delete
other users' comments on their own pull-reqs...

IMO that's an abuse of the pull-req process, and in turn, Gavin
Andresens's commit access rights for the Bitcoin Core repo.

That kind of comment is perfectly on topic in the pull-req review
process; deleting it harms that process by removing useful information
about the trade-offs of the pull-req, both for people now, as well as
future efforts investigating the history of Bitcoin's protocol
development.

I think this should weigh in favor of Gavin Andresen not having commit
privileges for the Bitcoin Core repository.
