There is two kind of hard fork, the one who breaks things, and the one who
does not.
Restricting the non-segwit inputs would disrupt lots of services, and
potentially invalidating
hash time locked transactions, which is a very bad precedent.
So I'm strongly against this particular point.

Same problem for native multisig, however potentially less important than
the previous point.
