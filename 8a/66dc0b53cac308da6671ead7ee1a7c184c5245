This isn't usable for SPV wallets unless it has a birthday in it. Otherwise
you either need to scan the entire chain (slow) or find a fully indexed
copy of the block chain (expensive, more centralised). Just add a UNIX time
as an extra 4 bytes, or if you want to save a few characters then use a
uint16 that represents "days since birth of this specification".
