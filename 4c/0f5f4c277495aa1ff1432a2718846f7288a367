Well, if CHECKSIG* and CHECKMULTISIG* are all disabled in favour of
CHECKDLS, CHECKDLSVERIFY and CHECKDLSADD with both different names and
different opcodes, copying a script template opcode-for-opcode from v0
to v1 will always fail. (With taproot, this doesn't necessarily mean you
lose money, even if the script is impossible to ever satisfy, since you
may be able to recover via the direct signature path)

It's definitely bikeshedding so whatever; but to me, it seems like it'd
be easier for everyone to have it so that if you've got the same opcode
in v0 script and v1.0 script; they have precisely the same semantics.

(That said, constructions like "<n> CLTV <p> CHECKSIGVERIFY" that avoid
the DROP and work when you're expected to leave a true value on the
stack won't work if you have to end up with an empty stack)
