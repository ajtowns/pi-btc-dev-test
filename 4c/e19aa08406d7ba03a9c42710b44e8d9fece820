Some thoughts about Alex's analysis:

- bitcoin price may increase (though doubling immediately might be
unlikely) after the halving (because the new coins are in short
supply). Apparently there is some evidence of a feedback loop between
number of freshly mined coins sold to cover electrical costs ongoing
(which depends on halving also), in that there are claims that the btc
price experiences some downwards pressure when margins are slim as
miners sell almost all of them when the electrical cost takes most of
the profit, and otherwise tend more to hold coins longer term.

- that people who cant make money mining with 1/2 reward will resort
to attacking the network rather than living with it for 2weeks until
difficulty adjustment).  actually it will be longer than two weeks if
its going to result in a difficulty fall.

- that the miners wont act in their own meta-interest to aim for the
plausible new hashrate supported by the lower reward.  mining
equipment investment horizon being 3-6mo+ so it can easily make
economic sense to subsidise it for a bit to smooth the transition.

- fees might go up to unjam the network also, so the people
benefitting from the transactions utility also help cover the
transition costs.  or maybe someone makes an assurance contract to pay
the short fall and phase it out over a few months to smooth the shift.

- there is a wide range of electrical efficiency, and some are much
worse than others so there maybe a convenient equilibrium where there
are enough left who can still profit.

- alternatively you might say why not 1/100th reward reduction per 2
week period rather than 1/2 every 4 years, a difficulty retarget could
be a convenient point to do that.
