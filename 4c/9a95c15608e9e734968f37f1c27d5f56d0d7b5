Subject: [Bitcoin-development] some feedbacks

Since I seemingly could not find the "create new post" link on the
forum, resorting to here...

a few feedbacks:
1) It would be helpful I think to, when the client first starts, to
ask "do you want to set a password to encrypt your wallet'? (if yes
take them to the encrypt wallet dialog).
I had been confused, since I knew 0.5 had "wallet encryption" I
assumed it would prompt on startup...
Also nice might be a message "first we have to synchronize with the
network, this will take several hours, then you'll be ready to go" or
some odd.
2) After synchronizing with the network, I believe the OS X client
started *always* crashing on startup.  Lost the backtrace but will
post it here if I can reproduce it.
3) With the forum I can't seemingly reply or create new posts? (rogerdpack)

Cheers!
