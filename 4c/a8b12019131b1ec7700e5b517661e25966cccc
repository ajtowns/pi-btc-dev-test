Bitcoin transactions do not have input addresses - they optionally have addresses
the input coins were last sent to. I understand that being able to have a
'from' address on a transaction is useful in certain cases, but it encourages
using such 'from' addresses to identify transactions - which is imho the wrong
way to go.

As far as your green transactions idea is concerned, maybe we could provide an interface
to mark certain addresses as 'trusted', and have an RPC call to request all incoming
transaction that originate from trusted sources?
