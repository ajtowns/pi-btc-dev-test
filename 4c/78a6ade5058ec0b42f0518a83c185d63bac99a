That's certainly be a good place to be, but the design of Bitcoin
currently makes achieving that goal fundementally difficult.

Do you specifically mean selfish mining as defined in Emin G?n
Sirer/Ittay Eyal's paper? Keep in mind that attack is only a significant
issue in a scenario - one malicious miner with >30% hashing power -
where you're already very close to the margins anyway; the difference
between a 50% attack threshold and a 30% attack threshold isn't very
significant.

Far more concerning is network propagation effects between large and
small miners. For that class of issues, if you are in an environemnt
where selfish mining is possible - a fairly flat, easily DoS/sybil
attacked network topology - the profitability difference between small
and large miners even *without* attacks going on is a hugely worrying
problem. OTOH, if you're blocksize is small enough that propagation time
is negligable to profitability, then selfish mining attacks with <30%
hashing power aren't much of a concern - they'll be naturally defeated
by anti-DoS/anti-sybil measures.

I think the latter was assumed as well, although ruling out of the
former is impossible.

Note though that Eligius is *not* the only pool to have had problems
with block withholding, though AFAIK Eligius is the only one who has
gone on record so far. (as I said in my original post, I'm relaying
information given to me under condition of confidentiality)
