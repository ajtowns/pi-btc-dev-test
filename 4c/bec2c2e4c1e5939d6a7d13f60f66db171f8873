Just pedantry: 100% of credit card transactions _can_ be fradulantly charged 
back but arent.  In fact, only 2% are ever attempted.

If N was 5%, then only 5% of bitcoin transactions _could_ be fraudulantly 
"charged back"; so then why wouldn't only 2% of those bitcoin transactions 
be fraudulant too, just as in the CC case?

The comparison would then be 2% chargebacks for credit cards, equivalent to 
0.1% (5%*2%) for bitcoin.


Not that I think that makes anything else you say invalid.
