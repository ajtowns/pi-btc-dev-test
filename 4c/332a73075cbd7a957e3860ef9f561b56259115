It won't work as you thought. If a miner has 95% of hashing power, he 
would have 95% of chance to find the next block and collect the penalty. 
In long term, he only needs to pay 5% penalty. It's clearly biased 
against small miners.

Instead, you should require the miners to burn the penalty. Whether this 
is a good idea is another issue.
