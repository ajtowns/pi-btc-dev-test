Hi Erik,

I have left you some comments below.

Some general questions:
How will you deal with excessive sighashing (i.e. massive transactions
that include a lot of signature verification)?
Presumably the sigops limit will increase proportionally?

What does EB stand for?

What is the point of users publishing an EB? Is it for miners to
determine what to set theirs to? If so, what about sybil attacks with
fake nodes publishing EBs?

How do users publish an EB? Do they use a transaction? Or is it
something that goes into the User Agent?

How high can the EB go? What is its maximum?

So anyone who does not change their EB are forked off of the network? If
the EB is an "advanced feature", then most users are going to be leaving
it at the default shipped with the software. That means that they will
then be forked off of the network when they don't change the EB because
it is an "advanced feature" that is more difficult to access.

I think this would require a soft fork beforehand in order to implement
such a system.

"Scaling" includes a lot more than just the block size. There is much
more to scaling than just increasing the block size.

What if the EB of a new node is set to be smaller than the current block
size?
