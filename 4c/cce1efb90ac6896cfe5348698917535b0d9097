It heavily depends on where you use it. Here in UK any card payments are
often limited to minimum of ?5 in small shops that have heavy transaction
fees burden and low margins. Big networks with more resources often let you
pay as little as you want by card, and they more often have NFC enabled POS
devices.
So it's not an NFC or POS limit, but a business decision for these small
merchants. Bitcoin can address this issue for sure, but this doesn't
concern NFC.
