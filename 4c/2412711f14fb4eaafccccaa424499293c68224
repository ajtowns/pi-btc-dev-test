That's rather interesting code. Is this using a private C# bitcoin
implementation?

Yes, of course. The transaction list should just say something like

    "Payment received from Jeremy,  0.1 BTC"

I am surprised it's not already the case! Though "merchant" is perhaps a
bit biased as a name, internally it perhaps should just be called
"Recipient". There's no requirement for you to be a merchant to create
payment protocol requests.

The wallet format would need extending.

I'd feel a lot more comfortable if the protocol was reviewed by a
professional cryptographer though. I think think Gregory already brought up
an issue to do with people able to detect such payments by testing if
decrypted values are points on the curve, or something like that.
