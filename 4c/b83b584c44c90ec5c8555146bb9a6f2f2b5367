Chris,

First, an important point: addresses are not wallet ids. They are single-use 
destinations for a single transaction. It isn't intended that anyone should 
remember them, just that they should send them electronically (or with eg, QR-
Codes). Bitcoin does not (yet?) have a person/wallet identity system, but 
there are other mechanisms for this already (eg, PGP).

With regard to your idea, I believe it is satisfied by the new Payment 
Protocol that Gavin has been working on. You will be able to publish a URI for 
a website which people can reuse to pay you more than once.

Luke
