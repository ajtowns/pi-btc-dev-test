IME most CAs verify by emailing hostmaster/webaster@ or one of the
contacts in the WHOIS.  But you're right, still subject to a MitM.
Still better than nothing though.

I would have suggested an EV cert, but that's more expensive (and
still far from foolproof)

Also helps protect against DNS spoofing attacks, but yes, you're
right.  I should be checking GPG sigs but I'm lazy :-)
