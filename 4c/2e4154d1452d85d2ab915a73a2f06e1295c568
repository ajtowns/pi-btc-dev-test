I think that patch is ok as it doesn't really have any fixed concept of
what is uneconomical. But I haven't thought about it much. As Gavin says,
there's an obvious backwards compatibility problem there. It should
probably wait until the payment protocol work is done, so the major user of
micropayments-as-messages  can migrate off them.
