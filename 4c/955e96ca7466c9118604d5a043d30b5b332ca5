I don't think we should put any Bitcoin users at additional risk to help
altcoins. If they fork the code they are making maintenance their own
responsibly.

It's hard to disclose a bitcoin vulnerability considering the network is
decentralised and core can't force everyone to update. Maybe a timeout
period for vulnerabilities could be decided. People might be expected to
patched before then at which point the vulnerability can be published. Is
that not already sort of how it works?
