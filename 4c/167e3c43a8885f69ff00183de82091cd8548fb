On-topic:
This argument is quite the fallacy. The only reason we have that few
pools is because each of their miners doesn't find it feasible to mine
"on their own". if you count the individual miners on those pools you
will get to the scale Gavin was trying to point out.

Nevertheless i think that is just a minor disagreement, since tree
chains help decentralization.
