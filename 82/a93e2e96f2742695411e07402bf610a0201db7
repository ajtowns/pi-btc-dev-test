The question you asked them was likely about the block size. The main 
difference is that SPV users do not need to update after BIP109, but they do 
need to have a new wallet when SegWit transactions are being sent to them.

This upgrade affects also end users, not just businesses etc.

Personally, I'd say that 2 months is even too fast.
