That sounds like a rather unlikely scenario. Unless you have a specific reason to suspect that might be the case, I think we don't need to worry about it too much. If we announce the intention to perform such a soft fork a couple of months before the soft fork becomes active, and if nobody complains about it destroying their secret stash, then I think that's fair enough and we could proceed.
