You could request all the transaction hashes by specifying a very deep level. You could modify the proposal by removing the "level" byte in "gettreelevel" and always send the deepest level ie. The transaction hashes. Though by specifying the level you do not need to download all of the transaction hashes, only the hashes you need to verify each segment.
