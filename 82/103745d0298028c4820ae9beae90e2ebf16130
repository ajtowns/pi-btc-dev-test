SPV clients that connect exclusively to hidden services through Tor
could mitigate this, especially if those clients broadcast their
transactions through different peers than the ones they use for
checking their balance.

Maybe they should even go the opposite way in terms of the false
positive rate.

A client could create a filter that *only* matches their notification
address and use that filter with a selected peer.

All the rest of their addresses would be contained in a different
filter that is never sent to the same full node which is watching
their notification address.

I'm not sure this problem is solvable in general.

Any entity which has sent bitcoins to a known user could use that
knowledge to attempt to find their bloom filter (if they use one).

I think that for SPV to have any privacy at all clients need to get a
lot smarter about how they use bloom filters overall, such as by
connecting to more than one peer, only putting a subset of their
addresses in a single filter, and temporally varying the addresses
which they watch.
