?That's been really unclear to me. Personally, I'd love to see a vote from
the core and XT developers on:

 - what should the block size soft limit be in 12 months (min and max)
 - what should the block size hard limit be in 12 months (min and max)

 - at what rate should the hard limit grow over the next 10 years? (min and
max)

 - what mechanism should be used to update the soft limit
   (manual code change, time based, blockchain history, something else)
? - what me?chanism should be used to update the hard limit
   (hard fork code change, time based, blockchain history, something else)

Bonus:

? - what should the
?transaction ?
fee level be in 12 months (after the reward halves)??
 - what's a good measure of "(de)centralisation" and what value should
everyone aim for in 12 months?

As an interested newbie, I can't actually tell what most people think the
answers to most of those questions are. FWIW, mine would be:

 - soft limit in 12 months: 1MB-4MB
 - hard limit in 12 months: 2MB-20MB
 - hard limit grows at 17-40% a year (and should be >4x average txn volume)
 - update the soft limit by code changes or blockchain history
 - update the hardlimit by (1) fee level, (2) miner vote, (3) hard coded
time updates at a conservative (low) rate, (4) hard fork every couple of
years
 - transaction fees should in 12months should be lower per kB than today's
defaults, say 20%-50% of today's defaults in USD
 - number of bitcoin nodes, should be 20% higher in 12 months than it is now

?Cheers,
aj
