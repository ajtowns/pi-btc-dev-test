No one should use, nor anyone is advised to use, segwit transactions before it is fully activated. Having 2 months or 2 weeks of grace period makes totally no difference in this regard. If anyone tried to use segwit tx during your proposed 2 months grace period, all those txs were still everyone-can-spent.

All you are advocating is just stalling the process with no improvement in security.
