Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Reality Keys trusted oracle service
Message-ID: <20140117145212.GA8760@petertodd.org>

Finally seeing a more complex script-use-case being implemented:

http://www.coindesk.com/reality-keys-bitcoins-third-party-guarantor-contracts/

    Enter Reality Keys, a new service by Tokyo-based startup Social
    Minds due for public launch on 20th January. Reality Keys provides
    real-world data in a form that can be used to complete or disregard
    bitcoin transactions, based on quantifiable facts.

    [...]

    Users then specify a date at which they would like to confirm the
    status or outcome of a particular event, and two cryptographic
    public keys are provided: one for if the event happens and another
    for if it doesn?t.

    [...]

    It is all, of course, anonymous. Reality Keys provides only the
    keys, and has no interest in or knowledge of the nature of the
    contract or the amounts of bitcoin at stake.
