FYI, a few developers including Wladimir, Greg, Peter Todd, Pieter, and
Alex Morcos have been discussing what to do about improving the signal
noise ratio on bitcoin-dev list.  One proposal similar to this discussion
was to split it into multiple mailing lists.  It was pointed out that the
less technical Bitcoin discussion list already existed in the past and
nobody used it.  Generally the discussion went away from creating yet
another mailing list and toward instituting an on-topic guidelines for
bitcoin-dev.  Gavin, Wladimir, and a few of the others agreed to a simple
few paragraphs written by Alex Morcos.  IIRC Wladimir agreed to post it.
Has it been posted yet?
