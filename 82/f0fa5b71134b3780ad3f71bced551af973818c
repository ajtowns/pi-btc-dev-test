Come to think of it, we've got that exact situation right now: the new
Twister P2P Microblogging thing has a blockchain for registering
usernames that could have been easily done with Namecoin, thus in theory
Namecoin owners have an incentive to make sure the Twister blockchain
gets killed at birth.

Pretty easy to do right now too as the hashing power behind Twister is
miniscule and probably will stay that way - the only incentive to mining
is that you get the right to make a "promoted post" - called a spam
message in the codebase - that in theory Twister clients are supposed to
show to their users. Of course, there's absolutely no way to guarantee
that clients actually do that.
