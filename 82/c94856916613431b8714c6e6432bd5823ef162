Anything requiring widespread adoption of patched clients *is by definition* a 
hard fork.

This is a hard fork.

The only way to avoid a hard fork is to apply the existing lock limit to all 
clients forever. That would be fine, except that pre-0.8 clients cannot reorg 
N blocks without dividing that limit by (N * 2) + 1; that leaves us with the 
limit of around 1000 locks per block on average. Each transaction uses at 
least 3 locks on average (many times more). So about 300 transactions per 
block. This is a much smaller limit than the 1 MB we've been assuming is the 
bottleneck so far, and the need to increase it is much more urgent - as Pieter 
noted on IRC, we are probably already using more than that even ignoring DP 
spam. The only reason pre-0.8 clients have survived as well as they have thus 
far is because the blockchain has managed to avoid very deep reorgs.
