I understand. Thank you for your explanation.

Another thought I have, is that instead of committing to the UTXO of the block, to commit to the UTXO of the previous block, and the merkle tree root of the transactions in the current block.

My thought is that this would help reduce SPV mining, as a miner would need to actually scan any received new blocks in order to create the UTXO set of the previous block. An empty block would make things easier for the next block's miner, not the current block's miner. However, I'm not sure if my understanding is correct, or if there is some subtlety I missed in this regard.
