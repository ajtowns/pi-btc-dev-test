Agreed, supports_instant is redundant and can/should/will go.

trusted_instant_providers on the other hand I think is needed.

Sometimes the providers will charge fees for instant.

While the software can ignore the fields, 
users may not want to pay for instant when the merchant may not accept it or 
care (even if it would not break the protocol it would still be a waste of 
fees)

Does it make sense? 

Not all transactions from GreenAddress provide double spend protection, there 
are additional checks on prevout that are normally not done when spending 
normally, etc
