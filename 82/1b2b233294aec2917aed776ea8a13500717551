A decentralized, distributed application should offer its users
decentralized, distributed method of weighing in on the direction of
how it evolves as well as having an open development model.  The
reference to Facebook and Myspace is completely inapplicable here
because the tyranny of such spaces isn't what we have with bitcoin
(fortunately), nor would we want to try to replicate it, ever, in any
way, shape, or form.

Yes, it does bother (some) people to see the consensus based system
because of the difficulties that can be associated with implementing
it.  But that's the way it is.  If you don't like consensus based
systems (or decentralized, distributed systems) this is probably the
wrong space for you.
