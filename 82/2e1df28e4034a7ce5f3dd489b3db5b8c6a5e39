Earlier in the discussion I suggested Discourse so that the BIP page
would be able to look smoother and draw more input.
Unsystem forum is run on Discourse and has twitter, github, and e-mail
integration.
For those who haven't explored it, here is what that looks / feels like:
https://forum.unsystem.net/

I'm curious as to why this sort of solution should or should not be
considered from someone else's perspective. In the end, whatever
works best for all concerned, I'm fine with it, but I'd like to hear
more about people's thoughts on Discourse. (I kind of like the feel
of it.)
