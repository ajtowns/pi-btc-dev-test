No, OTOH if they don't then the situation is no difference from what we
have now, and replace-by-fee does no harm. Meanwhile, relaying of bare
double-spend signatures can be implemented in the future, as I suggested
last year for your/Andresen's double-spend relaying patch.

Did you notice the even more obvious way to defeat ANYONECANPAY scorched
earth with that patch?

So? RBF nodes will.

I suspect many won't, because few people need to rely on unconfirmed
transactions anyway.

If you're going to consider replacement, conflict processing will
definitely be more expensive. :)

An actual DoS attacker would do their DoS attack in a way where conflict
processing has nothing to do with it, so this change does no actual
harm.

What exact git commit were you looking at? I did have an early one that
did have a bug along those lines, now fixed.

The current version ensures every replacement pays at least as much
additional fees as would normally cost to broadcast that much data on
the network, and additionally requires the fees/KB to always increase;
under all circumstances it should be no more of a DoS threat than
low-fee transactions are otherwise. I'd like to know if there is a flaw
in that code however!
