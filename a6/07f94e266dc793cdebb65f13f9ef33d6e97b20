If you are going to support this use case, you should also notify the user
on wallet changes that results in invalidated backup. For example whenever
the key pool gets extended.

I got email from a tester who gave this feedback:

I agree that is likely to happen and, when it does, will be disastrous.
So I'll be reworking the wallet encrypt/rewrite code today and creating a
release candidate 6.

My previous attempt (encrypt, invalidating keypool, then unlock and write a
new keypool) resulted in unencrypted private keys in the new wallet.

I think this will work, I'll implement and test today.

Invalidate all the old keypool keys in the old wallet.Write new keypool keys
to the old wallet.Encrypt all the keys in the old wallet.Rewrite the old
wallet to create a new wallet.Shutdown/restart.
IF ANYBODY IS WILLING TO HELP:

There is still a mysterious problem with bdb throwing an exception when
dbenv.close(0) is called during shutdown. If you can compile a -g version of
bdb and then step through DbEnv::close in a debugger and tell me why it is
throwing an exception that would be extremely helpful.
