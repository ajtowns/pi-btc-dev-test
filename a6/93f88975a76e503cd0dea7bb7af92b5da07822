It is already implemented for Linux (Gnome) and Windows, but there is an
issue with boost::ipc that crashed bitcoin at startup on windows, so it's
temporarily disabled on Windows.

Label is a label for the destination address, message is a freeform message
describing the transaction.

I don't think the message is currently stored in the Satoshi client. That
feature is somewhere on our way-too-long issue and todo list.

But I understand that you want to add transaction meta-data fields such as
contact information, bought items, item prices?
