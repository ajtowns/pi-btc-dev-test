This is not quite right: we know that selfish mining is a guaranteed win
at 34%. We do not know when exactly it begins to pay off. The more
consolidated and centralized the other mining pools, the less of a threat
it is below 34%; the more decentralized, the more likely it is to pay off
at lower thresholds.

On a related note, the Bitcoin-NG paper took a big step towards moving
these kinds of concerns out of the realm of gut-feelings and wavy hands
into science. In particular, it introduced metrics for fairness (i.e.
differential
rate in orphans experienced by small and large miners), hash power
efficiency, as well as consensus delay.

Indeed, there is a slight, quantifiable benefit to larger pools. Which is
why
we need to be diligent about not letting pools get too big.

I can see why they don't want to go public with this: it means that they
are less profitable than other pools.

It still looks to me like Ittay's discovery is doing exactly the right
thing:
this pool will need to be more careful when signing up new people,
curbing its otherwise steady march towards the 51% boundary.
