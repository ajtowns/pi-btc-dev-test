It's also not secure, since the signed messages only prove ownership of the 
address associated with the private key, and does not prove ownership of 
UTXOs currently redeemable with the private key, nor prove past UTXOs spent 
were approved by the owner of the address.

This appears to be incompatible with CoinJoin at least. Maybe there's some 
clean way to avoid that by using 
https://github.com/Blockstream/contracthashtool ?

I also agree with Pieter, that this should *not* be so cleanly compatible 
with Bitcoin transactions. If you wish to share code, perhaps using an 
invalid opcode rather than OP_RETURN would be appropriate.
