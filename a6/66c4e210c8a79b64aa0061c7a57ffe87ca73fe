Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Generalized versionbits BIP requesting number
	assignment
Message-ID: <OSA0fRQCK0EjpoZFiC5sFPPZmMWqAhQMwL4C0qcpGYmAM3v2xSerki-w6M7lpj4e1XyD269RP_ifcyMWpyF3aFkNhtFLhs4jBL1H3noH8Rk=@protonmail.com>

Hola,

I've submitted the generalized versionbits specification for BIP number assignment:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/532

Your feedback and comments welcome.

The spec has been updated to include a link to the reference implementation.
I hope to find time soon to produce a similar reference implementation on Bitcoin Core.

Sancho
