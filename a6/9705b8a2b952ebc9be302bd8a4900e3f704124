That's not true at all. They activate with a miner majority (e.g. 75%, 
95%, etc.), not global consensus.  Here global really means global, i.e. 
miner, economic, all clients, etc.  In the case of a hardfork there is 
nothing stopping the miner minority from continuing the old chain.  With 
a softfork the miner minority is forced to upgrade otherwise their 
blocks will be eventually orphaned.

My proposal achieves a hardfork-like blocksize limit increase but, like 
a softfork, also forces the miner minority to upgrade.
