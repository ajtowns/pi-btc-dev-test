With ten people commenting on this proposal there are quite a few ways
in which you could partition their views. Only one possible integer
partitioning has everyone in the same partition, so consensus seems
unlikely.

But owing to a rather large bribe (or at least not less large than any
other offered by competing parties) I hereby assign BIP 42 for this
proposal.
