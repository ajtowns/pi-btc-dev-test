Apologies if I am a bit late to the thread.  I bumped into someone that
suggested I take a look at it.  Will try and catch up!

Is there no good canonicalization algorithm / library for JSON?

I think that provided that each JSON object has an identifier,
canonicalization of JSON is not that hard.

Then when you hash or sign the canonical form they can be compared reliably.
