In effect, there is a confirm penalty for less strict blocks.  Confirms =
max(miner_confirms, merchant_confirms - 3, 0)

Merchants who don't upgrade end up having to wait longer to hit
confirmations.

That is a good idea.  Any parameters that have miner/merchant differences
should be modifiable (but only upwards) in the command line.

"Why are my transactions taking longer to confirm?"

"There was a soft fork to make the block size larger and your client is
being careful.  You need to add "minermaxblocksize=4MB" to your
bitcoin.conf file."

Hah, it could be called a "semi-hard fork"?
