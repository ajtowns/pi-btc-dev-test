Technically 3 KB. In my experience codes above 1.5 KB become impossible
to scan (ZXing scanner, 3 years ago). You will want to stay below 500
bytes for convenient scanning. That said, I'm convinced there is a lot
of room for scanning improvements.

As said in the OP, a minimal PR uses 50 bytes. X.509 seems to put about
4000 bytes on top of that.

As you can see, we have quite some room for improvements to PR payload
(PaymentDetails). X.509 certification will probably not be possible via
QR, at least not until specialized CA's will issue space-efficient certs
(using ECDSA?).
