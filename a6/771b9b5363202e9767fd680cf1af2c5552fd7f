Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Dedicated server for bitcoin.org,
	your thoughts?
Message-ID: <52A3C8A5.7010606@gmail.com>

I would like to know what are your thoughts on moving bitcoin.org on a
dedicated server with a SSL certificate?

I am considering the idea more seriously, but I'd like some feedback
before taking steps.
