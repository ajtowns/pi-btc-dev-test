I like the intend of this attempt to bring more clarity to the blocksize
debate, however it would be more help to make this a information site about
the current outstanding BIPs and summarize their differences rather than
voting mechanism.
 (ofcourse the author of the BIPs would "vote" for their own proposals.)

It would be good to include supporting and counter statements regards to
these BIPs on the site.
in addition to highlight certain things like pools in china have voiced
their opinion that increase should happen, and 8mb is something they are
comfortable with, which is not directly related to a single BIP, but never
the less relevant in this discussion.
