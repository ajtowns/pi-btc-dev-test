No, randomly connected gossip networks (which is what the Bitcoin p2p
network is) don't work that way, bandwidth is (roughly) O(N) where N is the
number of bytes relayed to everybody.

(it is actually a small multiple of N, because of the overhead of 'inv'
messages, and if we ever get really serious about scaling up we'll need to
fix the protocol to reduce that overhead, but that won't be a problem for
years).
