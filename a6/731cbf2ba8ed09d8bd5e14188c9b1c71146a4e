I have proposed packaging part of the block chain (doesn't even have to be
weekly, just until the last checkpoint), but people fear it runs contrary
to the distributed approach of Bitcoin.

Which is kind of true:

- If it is imported un-validated, you have to rely on the packager to lie
to you (insert false transactions etc)
- If it has to be validated, you win nothing, your computer has to crunch
for days anyway

BTW: On such an old computer you should probably use one of the thin
clients.
