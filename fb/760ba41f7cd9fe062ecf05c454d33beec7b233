Is this proposal recursive?


*Coinbase transaction *

* n-txid = txid


*Non-coinbase transactions*
* replace sigScripts with empty strings
* replace txids in TxIns with n-txid for parents

The 2nd step is recursive starting from the coinbases.

In effect, the rule is that txids are what they would have been if n-txids
had been used right from the start.
