If partition is selected from a random key (the hash of the output for
example) then payment recipients would need to operate a full node on
each of the chains.

What's the point of partitioning if virtually everybody needs to operate
each partition?

The mining aspect has it's own set of issues, but I'm not going to get
into those.
