It's not meant to prove anything - the proof-of-sacrificed-bitcoins
mentioned(*) in it is secure only if Bitcoin itself is secure and
functional. I referred you to it because understanding the system will
help you understand my thinking behind merge-mining.

*) It also mentions proof-of-sacrificed-zerocoins which *is* distinct
because you're sacrificing the thing that the chain is about. Now that
has some proof-of-stake tinges to it for sure - I myself am not
convinced it is or isn't a viable scheme.

You're argument is perfectly valid and correct, *if* the assumptions
behind it hold. The problem is you're assuming miners act rationally and
have equal opportunities - that's a very big assumption and I have
strong doubts it holds, particularly for alts with a small amount of
hashing power.

You know, something that I haven't made clear in this discussion is that
while I think merge-mining is insecure, in the sense of "should my new
fancy alt-coin protocol widget use it?", I *also* don't think regular
mining is much better. In some cases it will be worse due to social
factors. (e.g. a bunch of big pools are going to merge-mine my scheme on
launch day because it makes puppies cuter and kids smile)

All I'm saying is that if you can afford the transaction fees stuffing
your data into the Bitcoin blockchain has orders of magnitude better
security. I'm not saying it'll be cheap - if miners start trying to
block your protocol blacklists they can make it fairly expensive for
your alt - but it will be just as secure against reorganization attack
as Bitcoin itself.

Heh, my one line reply might have been a bit harsh because of that. :)
