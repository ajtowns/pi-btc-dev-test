That doesn't make any sense. Against a SPV wallet you don't need that attack;
with that kind of budget you can fool it by just creating a fake block at far
less cost, along with a sybil attack. Sybils aren't difficult to pull off when
you have the budget to be greating fake blocks.

That's technically incorrect: txouts can only be spent once, so you'll need to
do 2^40 work each time you want to repeat the attack to grind the matching part
of the prevout again.
