Subject: [Bitcoin-development] A way to create a fee market even without
	a block size limit (2013)

Why do so many tie the block size debate to creating "a fee market", as if one didn't already exist? Yes, today we frequently see many low priority transactions included into the next block, but that does not mean there is not a marketplace for block space. It just means miners are not being sufficiently tough to create a *competitive* marketplace. 

But who are we to say that the marketplace should be more competitive, and to go further and try to force it by altering consensus rules like the block size limit? If miners want to see more competitive fees, then they need only to alter their block creation protocol. 

There are many arguments for and against changing the consensus limit on block size. I'm simply saying that "to force a marketplace for fees/block space" should not be one of them. Let the market develop on it's own.

BTW, think the maximum tps should be increased, but not by increasing the block size, but by increasing the block rate (I'll     expose why in my next e-mail).
