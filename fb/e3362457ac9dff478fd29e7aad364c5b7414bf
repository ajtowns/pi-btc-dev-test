Unfortunately there's more incompatibility than just the date issue:

* seed: some follow BIP39, and some roll their own
* HD structure: some follow BIP44, some BIP32 derivation, and some roll
their own

So actually very few wallets are seed-compatible, even ignoring the date
question.

That's a reasonable solution.
