This is true, but miners already control block size through soft caps.
Miners are fully capable of producing smaller blocks regardless of the max
block limit, with or without collusion. Arguably, there is no need to ever
reduce the max block size unless technology advances for some reason
reverse course - aka, WW3 takes a toll on the internet and the average
bandwidth available halves. The likelihood of significant technology
contraction in the near future seems rather unlikely and is more broadly
problematic for society than bitcoin specifically.

The only reason for reducing the max block limit other than technology
availability is if you think that this is what will produce the fee market,
which is back to an economic discussion - not a technology scaling
discussion.
