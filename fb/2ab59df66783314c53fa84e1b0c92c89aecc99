Then don't use BIP9...

Honestly, if the reason for the too-short-for-safety timespan is that you 
want to use BIP9, then please take a step back and realize that SegWit is a 
contriversial soft-fork that needs to be deployed in a way that is extra 
safe because you can't roll the feature back a week after deployment.
All transactions that were made in the mean time turn into everyone-can-
spent transactions.

I stand by the minimum of 2 months. There is no reason to use BIP9 as it was 
coded in an older client. That is an excuse that I don't buy.
