Doing that only makes addresses a few % shorter, at the cost of significant
downsides.  For example, not everyone knows what those additional characters
are called, particularly for non-English-speaking users. Non-alphanumeric
characters also complicate using the addresses in a variety of contexts ('/'
in particularly isn't valid in filenames).

I'd suggest you review the "Rational" section of the BIP for more details:
