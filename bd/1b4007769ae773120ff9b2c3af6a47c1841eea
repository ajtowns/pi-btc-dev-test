What if we reduce the block size to 0.125MB? That will allow 0.375tx/s. 
If 3->24 sounds "almost the same", 3->0.375 also sounds almost the same. 
We will have 50000 full nodes, instead of 5000, since it is so 
affordable to run a full node.

If 0.125MB sounds too extreme, what about 0.5/0.7/0.9MB? Are we going to 
have more full nodes?

No, I'm not trolling. I really want someone to tell me why we 
should/shouldn't reduce the block size. Are we going to have more or 
less full nodes if we reduce the block size?
