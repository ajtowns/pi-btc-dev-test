Thanks, fixed.

Yes, I've done some initial outreach and plan on doing another major
round now that the initial network is up and Im working on running some
relay time benchmarks. Finding someone to help push peering would be
nice, if you have any suggestions, Im all ears.

Agreed, improving relay times across the regular P2P network would be
nice, however I really dont see this as a part of the P2P network. Its
more of a backup relay network that just happens to follow the P2P
protocol (mostly, it doesnt do full block verification, so technically
it breaks spec). In this model, this is really a nice augment to the P2P
network no matter what improvements are made. Having more protocols/ways
blocks are relayed is always nice (anyone wanna launch a satellite?)
