I think the expected number of peers is actually ~47.75, which is pretty
close to David's estimate, which was wrong in a way that was actually
more favorable to the "everyone stores random blocks" scheme than the
truth.

Even assuming no archival nodes, and all nodes storing only one random
index between 5 and 255 inclusive, the chance of five arbitrary nodes
giving unique indices by chance is about 98.4%. To get the same probability
from a scheme where each peer has only 25% of the blocks, you need to
connect to 59.59 nodes.

This is over a ten-times increase in the number of nodes required to
download the entire chain, and requires participating nodes to use 25%
more space than David's proposal.

Storing random but complete blocks requires the assumption this is _not_ the
case; David's does not make any assumptions. So on top of the performance
considerations there is this potential DoS vector.
