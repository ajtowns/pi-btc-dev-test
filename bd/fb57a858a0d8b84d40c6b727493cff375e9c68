ACK for Ledger. What's necessary to sign a transaction is well known, I
don't see how driving any hardware wallet from the wallet itself or from a
third party daemon implementing that URL scheme would make any difference,
other than providing better devices interoperability, as well as easier
maintenance and update paths for the wallets.
