With DSP hat on, your decoder for noisy/distorted channels will be 99.9% of
the complexity and will completely control the design of the encoder.

It's not a proposal yet without a decoder, it's just an idea.  FSK modems
microphone-channel (terrible multipath) is quite challenging and several
other parties have tried to do bitcoin info over audio in the past without
success.

It's very interesting, but I think you do need to go through and get the
whole thing working to really gauge viability.
