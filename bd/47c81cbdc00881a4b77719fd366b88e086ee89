Yes, BIP9 need to be adjusted (setting bit 30 means BIP9 counts it as a
vote against all softforks).  BIP101 uses bits 0,1,2 AFAICT, so perhaps
start from the other end and use bit 29?  We can bikeshed that later
though...

A delicate balance.  If we penalize these blocks too much, it's
disincentive to set the bit.  Fortunately it's easy for SPV clients to
decide for themselves, I think?

Cheers,
Rusty.
