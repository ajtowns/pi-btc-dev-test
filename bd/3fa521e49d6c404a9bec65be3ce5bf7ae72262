Hey all, nice to meet you... I'm new to the community and thus, after taking that first step of signing up, have been reading/scanning these threads over the last few days without contributing my own two ?-- not, um, 'trolling', just, you know, educating myself and getting familiar with the group ethos and etiquette.  

It wasn't until I'd read ~10 posts that I  understood the initial purpose of the thread!  As few others have mentioned, I'm a bit surprised, at all the back and forth ? la hip-hop 'battling' ;-) It certainly obfuscates-- while entertaining-- to the point where a newbie like myself might drop out... Perhaps this is intentional-- to maintain exclusivity and weed out the uninitiated.  I dunno.  But if not, I'm just noting, as something of an outsider, that it took a while.

But I'd like to contribute.  With what little knowledge I possess, I'm inclined to favor hardfork... Is there a more suitable place to address this?  Perhaps to work on code?  For this specific project, that is...  Anyone point me to a map somewhere?  LOL.

Thanks to all for reading, and much admiration to you all and the work you've done, my latter comments notwithstanding!  

Cheers,
N
