If the user creates a password on an iOS device with an astral
character and then can't enter that password on a JVM wallet, that
sucks. If JVMs really can't support unicode NFC then that's a strong
case to limit the spec to the subset of unicode that all popular
platforms can support, but it sounds like it might just be a JVM
string library bug that could hopefully be reported and fixed. I get
the same result as in the test case using apple's
CFStringNormalize(passphrase, kCFStringNormalizationFormC);
