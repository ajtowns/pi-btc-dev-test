Funilly enough pretty much all low-level links that make up the
Internet use either bit-stuffing or byte-stuffing to escape a
particular bit sequence or byte that terminates an HDLC frame.

I'm not particularly agreeing or disagreeing with you on the
suitability for the case at hand, but as an absolute your statement
doesn't hold water.  The use of a terminator for a variable-length
data structure rather than a length prefix is a design desicion that
has little-to-nothing to do with the debate of text-versus-binary.

Anyone remember Holerith constants?
