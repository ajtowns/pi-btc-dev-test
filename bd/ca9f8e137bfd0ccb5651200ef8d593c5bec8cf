Let's just use a normal/low tag number. The extensions mechanism is great
for people who want to extend the protocol outside the core development
process. It'd be weird if nobody ever used the low numbers again though.

Tag numbers are varint encoded so using smaller ones does have a minor
efficiency benefit, it's not just aesthetics :)

Hmmm. Why "allow"? Should it not be called min_fee instead? Wallets would
have to attach at least that much in fees, right?

Also, why describe it as reducing the amount paid? Which output would be
reduced in value? Why not just have it be added to the total value
displayed to the user and the outputs are left alone/not reduced.

I like the idea but it seems this gets us back to the original problem -
senders don't care about confirmations, ever, not even if they make an
annoying set of transactions. The protocol allows users to submit
transactions directly to receivers, I guess, if the receiver does not like
the transactions they get they could potentially reject the payment. But
I'd hope that's really rare.

Sweet, thanks!
