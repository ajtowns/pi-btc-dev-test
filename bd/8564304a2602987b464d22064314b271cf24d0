To restate your (con dnssec) points:
   o DNS resolution of bitcoin addresses is bad because of potential
MITM attacks
   o DNSSEC is not a security measure for mitigating DNS resolution of
bitcoin addresses
      because the application would require its own dnssec enabled stub resolver

Please restate
   o HTTPS is your preferred method for resolution because?

If you can enumerate your advantages so I can develop a proper
response to the points you have raised.

thanks,
