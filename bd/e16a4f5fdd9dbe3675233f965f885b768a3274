You did. See the other sighash flags.

That way most existing problematic implementations would be fixed and no doors were closed for people experimenting with other stuff - tx v 3 would probably then be called experimental transactions.

In exchange you make the behavior basically impossible do deploy
without first blocking all ongoing transactions. This seems foolish.
All signers need to be updated to change their behavior to be
anti-malleability compatible, they can change their version at the
same time... and leave things actually working for the things which
can't be easily updated.
