Well, here are some quotes about CMake build tools...

JetBrains (2014)
================
Our brief research showed that CMake and ?make? were the most popular
cross-platform tools, having ~30% of users each, while both Autotools
and qmake had less than 7% of users. So we ended up with CMake and make.

KDE Project (2006)
==================
Now the next big change is happening: KDE is leaving the aging "autotool"
build chain behind. Some developers, not only in KDE, like to nickname
the autotools as "auto-hell" because of its difficult to comprehend
architecture. So, KDE 4 will feature a completely different build system:
CMake.

Also, there are more advanced build systems:
============================================
 - Meson [http://mesonbuild.com]
 - Ninja [https://ninja-build.org/]

All of them (CMake, Meson, Ninja) had a goal to replace automake.
Was there any discussion about choosing the best build system for
Bitcoin Core?

Thanks,
