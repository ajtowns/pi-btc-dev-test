Minimizing the number of UTXOs in a wallet is sometimes not in the best interests of the user. In fact, quite often I've wished for a configuration option like "Try to maintain _[number]_ UTXOs in the wallet." This is because I often want to make multiple spends from my wallet within one block, but spends of unconfirmed inputs are less reliable than spends of confirmed inputs, and some wallets (e.g., Andreas Schildbach's wallet) don't even allow it - you can only spend confirmed UTXOs. I can't tell you how aggravating it is to have to tell a friend, "Oh, oops, I can't pay you yet. I have to wait for the last transaction I did to confirm first." All the more aggravating because I know, if I have multiple UTXOs in my wallet, I can make multiple spends within the same block.
