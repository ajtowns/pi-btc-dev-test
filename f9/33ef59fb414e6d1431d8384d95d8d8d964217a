"Confirmations" in a numeric context isn't correct, though. We're using to it 
because we've been using Bitcoin so long, but to the average person they would 
expect it to mean something more than it is. If not referring to blocks, then 
perhaps "witnessed N times"?

I think you might be demonstrating my point with regard to user confusion 
here. Bitcoin addresses are *not* like email addresses, paypal ids, etc. 
Bitcoin addresses aren't the destination - they're point to a destination (an 
account in a wallet), but they also represent information such as who is 
paying and what for - in other words, a specific invoice.
