The part which lists raw Git pull requests says:
> #6057 ac5476e re-enable wallet in autoprune

But the main, handwritten part does not mention this.
Is pruning really finished, i.e. could I safely use it as a wallet "end-user"?

IMHO it would be one of the most interesting feature for users, as it could 
fix the issue of taking >60 GB of disk space.

So if it is finished, please mention that
- it's finished
- how to enable it.


Thanks for your hard work! :)
