I agree this would be useful for the "permit" case, but not the "confirm" case 
- it's important that transactions valid in block X also be equally valid in 
block X+1 to avoid reorg issues.

This would force every wallet to keep an index of all TXOs ever.

Actually, I think this may make address reuse easier, as with base58 adding 
data will make it impossible to tell at a glance when someone is reusing a key 
with just a different expiration... I suppose something other than base58 
*could* be used to resolve this, however.

They can already do this. It's perfectly valid for wallets/services to ignore 
(and not consider as payment) transactions using an address more than once. 
There might be race attacks if this is implemented in an immediate fashon 
(attacker transaction gets mined first to kill a payment), but should be 
pretty safe after a few blocks.
