Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Miners are struggling with blocks far smaller
 than 750KB blocks and resorting to SPV mining

As jl2012 indicated, this is an insufficient analysis.

You cannot assume that because X time passed since the last block, the
miner's internal block maker has updated the template, and from there, is
shipped out to the hashers in the field.  Further, even if you update the
block template at time Y, a hasher might return with a solution for the
block at time X, and the miner will of course publish solution X.

There are several steps of latency involved, even ignoring things such as
the miner relay network or getting US pool stratum links to a sub-pool in
China.
