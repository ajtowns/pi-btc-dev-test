One double-spend fighting option is for each mining pool to offer a realtime feed of accepted TXs.

I am hoping to complete the following later this month:
	
	(1) A minimal bitcoind patch that writes raw accepted TXs and BLOCKs to stdout with a prefix of ("2naXaRQj--TX\n%d\n" % (data_length))
		(Proof-of-concept done ? I'll submit a pull request with "--print-accepted-txs-and-blocks" when I get a chance to clean it up)
	
	(2) A minimal NodeJS app which invokes bitcoind as a subprocess, parses the TXs and BLOCKs, and offers a realtime feed
