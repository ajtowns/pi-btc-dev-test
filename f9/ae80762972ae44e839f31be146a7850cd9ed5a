Concept ACK.

For the details of executing the plan, I think the following is less disruptive:

1. Send a message with (max sequence - 1), notifying all nodes that the key will be retired on or before a date. People with systems relying on this key should either upgrade or ignore the revocation message. We don't know the actual date because the key is shared by many people.

With the max - 1 sequence, no message except the max sequence revocation message may override this message. 

2. Send the revocation message at the pre-announced time, if no one have done that before

3. After a few months or so, publish the private key.
