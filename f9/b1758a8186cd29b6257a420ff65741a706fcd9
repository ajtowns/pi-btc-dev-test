Credit card transactions are simply an expample of a widely used payment
system that has frequent fraud and chargebacks. The argument I'm making is
that different people in different situations value speed and convenience
over a known fraud risk. Instant zero confirmation transactions are
extremely useful despite the risk in all kinds of real world situations.
You can't substitute your own value judgements for everyone in every
situation.
