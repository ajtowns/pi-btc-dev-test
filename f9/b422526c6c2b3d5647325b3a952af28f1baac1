One of the main goals of steath addresses is actually scalability. In
particular in the refund address case you would use stealth addresses
with a per-order UUID so that refunds can be detected cheaply by just
scanning for payments to your (single) stealth address, then when those
payments are detected, check the UUID against a on-disk database. A
64-bit "UUID" is probably fine, although unfortunately with OP_RETURN
quite unexpectedly dropped to 40 bytes the standard needs to change;
might have to compromise on privacy and re-use a txin pubkey to make
things fit.
