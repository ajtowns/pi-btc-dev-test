I don't understand this.

Just disallowing duplicate coinbases is possible, but it requires keeping a
set of all coinbases transaction around until infinity. That's not really a problem,
but it can be avoided. One very reasonable proposed solution is adding the block
height to the coinbase. However, as coinbases are used for all kinds of things
already, this is harder to roll out network-wide. Hence, first this "emergency"
solution that already prevents (afaik) all practical attacks, and in a later step
forcing unique coinbases, so that transactions can be assumed to be unique
identifiable by their hash again.
