Oh, and we should also point out that Bloom filters have scaling issues,
as each application of the filter has to scan the whole blockchain -
with future blocksize increases these issues increase, in some proposals
quite dramatically. The underlying idea also conflicts with some
proposals to "shard" the blockchain, again suggesting that we need a bit
to handle future upgrades to more scalable designs.
