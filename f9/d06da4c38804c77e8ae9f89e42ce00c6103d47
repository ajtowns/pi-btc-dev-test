I disagree.

Therefore, we do not have a consensus.

As there is no consensus, you need to do one of two things:

1) Post a 10 page, 5 paragraph persuasive essay about how you are a Traitor
to Consensus, and do it
loudly on Reddit, MySpace, LinkedIn, etc, so that everyone in the community
is correctly informed.

2) Do nothing.

This is a very logical argument and is of the utmost seriousness, as what
Peter[:-1] is doing is a threat
to Consensus, which is the very foundation of Bitcoin. These are related
issues.

I question Peter[:-1]'s motives and hereby challenge him to a public debate
with the following conditions:

- - The subject is Bitcoin.
- - The debate may take place at any time at any place.
- - You will not know that the debate has begun until it is over.

Sincerely,
NMH
