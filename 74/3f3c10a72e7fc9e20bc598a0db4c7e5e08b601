Err actually not (efficient) I made a mistake that came out when I started
writing it up about how the t parameter in the proof relates to bitcoin
precision and coin representation (I thought t=2, but t=51).  Damn!  Back to
the not so efficient version (which is more zerocoin-esque in size/cost), or
the more experimental Schoenmaker non-standard p, q non EC one, or other
creative ideas to change the coin representation to simplify the proof (of
which this was a failed attempt).  See the bitcointalk thread for details.
