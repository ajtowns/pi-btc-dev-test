1. They won't be attacking Bitcoin, they will attack merchants who accept
payments with 0 confirmations. This attack has nothing to do with Bitcoin
consensus mechanism (as Bitcoin protocol doesn't provide a consensus over
mempool contents), thus it is not an attack on Bitcoin.
2. In the example I used, having 10% of hashpower is enough to offer 10%
success rate. Would you mind having 1 out of 10 hamburgers for free? If a
system can be attacked by a tiny fraction, it is a shitty system.
