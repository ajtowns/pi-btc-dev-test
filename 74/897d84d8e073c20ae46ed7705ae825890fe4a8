Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Weekly development meetings on IRC: schedule
Message-ID: <20150922143628.GB958@amethyst.visucore.com>

Hello,

There was overwhelming response that weekly IRC meetings are a good thing.

Thanks to the doodle site we were able to select a time slot that everyone (that voted) is available:

    Thursday 19:00-20:00 UTC, every week, starting September 24 (next Thursday)

I created a shared Google Calendar here:

The timezone of this calendar is Reykyavik (Iceland) which is UTC+0. However, you can use the button on the lower right to add the calendar to your own calendar, which will then show the meeting in your own timezone.

See you then,

Wladimir
