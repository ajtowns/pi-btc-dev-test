Pieter, these are in my opinion very reasonable positions. I've made some observations inline.

Yes, libbitcoin also provides these options on an IP basis.

I explicitly exclude client-server behavior as I believe the proper resolution is to isolate clients from the P2P protocol. Libbitcoin does this already.

You can't prevent people from create connections along preexisting trust lines. That does not mean that the network as a whole relies on first establishing trust everywhere.

Of course, the network operates just fine without universal trust. My concern is not that it is required, but that it may grow significantly and will have a tendency to gravitate towards more effective registration mechanisms for what is a "good" peer. Even an informal but pervasive web of trust may make it difficult for untrusted parties to connect.

You're very right to point out that this does not give you protection from active attackers, and that active attacking is relatively easy through sybil attacks. I still prefer my attacker to actually do that over just listening in on my connection.

We agree, and the ease of this attack must be acknowledged. And given that the protection is weak it is not unreasonable to consider the potential downside of creeping node identity.

> And yes, we should also work on improving the privacy nodes and wallets have orthogonal to encryption, but nothing will make everything perfectly private.

I agree, and I doubt this proposal will have much impact on an advanced persistent threat, or even lesser threats. People should understand that there is both a risk and a limited benefit to this proposal.

> BIP 151 plus a simple optional pre-shared-secret authentication extension can improve upon pure IP-based authentication, as well as simplify things like SSL tunnels, and onion addresses purely used as identity. This will still require explicit configuration, but not more than now.

I agree - I consider tunneling the legitimate use case for this proposal. Yet when nodes become closely coupled they are not fully independent. I have a concern with these practices being promoted for general use while at the same time being strongly implemented.

> BIP 151 plus a non-leaking public key authentication scheme (where peers can query "are you the peer with pubkey X?" but don't learn anything if the answer is no) with keys specific to the IP addresses can give a TOFU-like security. Nodes already remember IP addresses they've succesfully interacted with in the past, and ban IP addresses that misbehave. Being able to tell whether a node you connect to is the same as one you've connected to before is a natural extension of this,

With this I disagree. There is no way to know that a node is one you have connected to previously unless that node wants you to know (apart from relying on the IP address). This is of no value in detecting misbehaving nodes that do not want to be detected. Ones that don't care (eg broken nodes) can be sufficiently managed by IP address.

Absolutely.

Yes, let's not make it worse. This is a secondary concern. I remain primarily concerned about growth of node identity in a vain attempt to make transaction submission private in the P2P protocol (and to patch the other client-server features, specifically Bloom filters). As you imply, we cannot stop people from turning Bitcoin into a private network - but let's not facilitate it either.

I believe you have misinterpreted my comments on distributed anonymous credentials (and the like) as commentary on the construction of BIP151 (and a subsequent auth proposal). As such your observation that it is exaggerated would make sense, but it is not what I intended. Encryption and auth are straightforward. Preventing bad nodes from participating in an anonymous distributed system is not.
