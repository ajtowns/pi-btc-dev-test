A few issues:

Revocable payments are almost always invoked in cases where the decision
that a payment needs to be revoked is done by humans. To worry about the
difficulty of finding a "trusted escrow service" is irrelevant at the
protocol level - this isn't a problem that can be solved by math.

Legally speaking revocation can generally happen any time in the future,
even years in the future. Note the controversies involved around a
variety of land transactions that occured hundreds of years in the past
in North America and other parts of the world, where distant relatives
of those who made the transactions are attempting to have them reversed
partially or fully. Technical solutions with a limited revocation window
are likely to be found unacceptable in the eyes of the law.

Focusing on the need to "revoke" a transaction is taking a banking idea,
and applying it very incorrectly to the Bitcoin world; in banking
revoking a transaction can result in your balance being negative.

What you need to focus on is the spirit of what revoking a transaction
is about, which is to take money from someone who thought they had it,
and give it to someone else. We can easily replicate this effect in
Bitcoin by simply giving the private keys for our wallets to the
relevant revocation authority, or, if more auditing is desired, storing
our coins in 1-of-2 multisig addresses spendable by either us or that
authority.

In the event that a transaction needs to be revoked, simply have the
escrow service make a transaction that takes the correct amount of coins
from your wallet, and gives it to the person who sent you the money.

Problem solved.
