This situation isn't something that can be ignored and simply moved past. If 
you can't determine the validity of a block, you also cannot process its 
results correctly. Taking for example the BDB/LevelDB issue, the result was 
that BDB failed to accept further changes to the UTXO set. Unless the UTXO set 
could be updated correctly, there is no way to even attempt to validate the 
next block or any new transactions.
