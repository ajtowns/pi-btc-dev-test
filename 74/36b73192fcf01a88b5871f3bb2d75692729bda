By ignored, do you mean the nodes/miners didn?t even include the low fee transaction in their memory pools, so would no longer have access to it? If a node decides to not include it in its memory pool for this reason, I guess it won?t send out any INV messages either?

Could the broadcaster of TX_b rebroadcast TX_a? Then I guess any node that did add it to its memory pool would realize it?s not new and not rebroadcast it to those who didn?t, so it won?t propagate? Although, after receiving the orphan transaction TX_b, it could re-(pay attention) to an INV with TX_a (for a short-ish time to prevent further DoS vectors)? Assuming the sender of TX_b has a copy of TX_a?

For example, a third transaction C whose unconfirmed utxo from transaction B has an unconfirmed utxo in transaction A (all of A?s inputs are confirmed), with each A, B and C being ~300bytes, should C?s transaction fee be 0.0001 btc for the ~1kb it is about to commit to the blockchain, or 0.0003 btc for the 3 transactions it is going to commit.

It still hasn?t confirmed, which could be any of: a) CPFP doesn?t have enough hash power, b) the amounts are too small, c) the coins are too new, d) the fee should have actually been 0.0002 btc, e) the congestion is just too great; or some combination.
