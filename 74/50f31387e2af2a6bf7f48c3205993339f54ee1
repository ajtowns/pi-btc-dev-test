Owners of small mining rigs get paid by pools, generally using regular
transactions that pay regular fees (p2pool is an exception that pays
directly from coinbase).  The point is the unintended consequences are
directly at odds with one of the justifications offered for small blocks
- miner centralization.

This is a special case.  Raystonn's general point was that high fees
will lead to fewer economic actors overall, and therefore fewer full nodes.
