Having observed the customer support nightmare it tends to cause for a
small exchange service when 100% full blocks happen, I've been thinking
that the limit really should be dynamic and respond to demand and the
amount of fees offered. It just doesn't feel right when it takes ages to
burn through the backlog when 100% full is hit for a while. So, while
pondering this, I got an idea that I think has a chance of working that I
can't remember seeing suggested anywhere.

How about basing the maximum valid size for a block on the total bitcoin
days destroyed in that block? That should still stop transaction spam but
naturally expand the block size when there's a backlog of real
transactions. It'd also provide for an indirect mechanism for increasing
the maximum block size based on fees if there's a lot of fees but little
bitcoin days destroyed. In such a situation there'd be incentive to pay
someone to spend an older txout to expand the maximum. I realize this is a
rather half baked idea, but it seems worth considering.
