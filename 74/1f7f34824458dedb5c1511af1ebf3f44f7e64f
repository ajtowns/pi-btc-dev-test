Is this truly the intent?  That the merchant/processor takes full
responsibility for getting the TX confirmed?

It is within the customer's economic incentive -- and right as a free
person -- to work to get their transaction relayed to the network and
confirmed in parallel with whatever the merchant is doing.

BIP 70 states that the customer broadcasts the transaction, in
addition to sending the Payment message.
