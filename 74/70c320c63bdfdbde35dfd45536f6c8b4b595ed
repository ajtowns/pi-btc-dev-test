Oh yes there is interest. I meant to reply but haven't been able to put much
energy in bitcoin development lately.

More strict privilege seperation between applications on a least-authority
basis is something that Ubuntu is certainly going to need if they're serious
with the app store thing (and want to keep up with Android and Macosx...).

This has been needed for a long time, and this would be useful for any
private data managed by applications running as the same user (ssh,
browsers, pgp, ...)

Wallet encryption is useful and necessary but no substitute for OS-level
protection.

You have to rewrite the entire thing from scratch?

This is probably blasphemy but: how can it be compared to the android model,
with a UID per application/user, and thus layering the security on top of
current UNIX/ACL permissions?  Is another FS really needed?
