Who am I? Personally I have zero objection if the creator steps in. I
think he would be highly welcome by the most people. At first I had the
impression that the email was a fake, but maybe I was wrong. At the
moment I think: Maybe it's even the best if we do not know exactly
whether it was Satoshi or not.

Unanimity is mission critical for Bitcoin and must be an absolute
priority. If not the vast majority is in favor for a fork, then the fork
should be avoided until a consensus is found. Even if it takes until the
cows come home.

But it is very likely now that it will come to a fork. No matter which
site will win, this will produce a lot of humiliated people at the end.
That's not good and leads to bitterness on both sites.
