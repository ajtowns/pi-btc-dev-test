The timestamps simply needs to be reasonably accurate.  Their main purpose
is to allow difficulty updates.

They can also be used to check that the node has caught up.

Much of Bitcoin operates on the assumption that a majority of miners are
honest.  If 50%+ of miners set their timestamp reasonably accurately (say
within 10 mins), then the actual timestamp will move forward at the same
rate as real time.

Dishonest miners could set their timestamp as low as possible, but the
median would move foward if more than half of the timestamps move forward.

If you are assuming that the miners are majority dishonest, then they can
set the limit to anything as long as they don't move it more than 2 hours
into the future.

The miners could set their timestamps so that they increase 1 week fake
time every 2 weeks real time and reject any blocks more than 2 hours ahead
of their fake time.  The difficulty would settle so that one block occurs
every 20 mins.

For check locktime, the median of the last 11 blocks is used as an improved
indicator of what the actual real time is.  Again, it assumes that a
majority of the miners are honest.
