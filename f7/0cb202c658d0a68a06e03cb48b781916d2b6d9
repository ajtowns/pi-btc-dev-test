There's another important use case which you mentioned Greg, that also
requires special exemption: compact commitments via mid-state compression.

The use case is an OP_RETURN output sorted last, whose last N bytes are a
commitment of some kind. A proof of the commitment can then use mid state
compression to elide the beginning of the transaction.

How do you make a special exemption for this category of outputs? I can't
think of a very clean way of doing so that doesn't require an ugly
advertising of sort-order exemptions.

The fact that we have two different existing use cases which conflict with
soft-fork enforcement, I'm quiet concerned that there are either other
things we aren't thinking of or haven't invented yet which would be
affected.
