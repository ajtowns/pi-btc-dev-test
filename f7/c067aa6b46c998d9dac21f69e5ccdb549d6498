I'm very interested in this. I was expecting transitive/multi-hop
transactions (Ripple) with colored coins, and I don't understand why
is not possible.

>From https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts

SIGHASH_ALL: This is the default. It indicates that everything about
the transaction is signed, except for the input scripts. Signing the
input scripts as well would obviously make it impossible to construct
a transaction, so they are always blanked out. Note, though, that
other properties of the input, like the connected output and sequence
numbers, are signed; it's only the scripts that are not. Intuitively,
it means "I agree to put my money in, if everyone puts their money in
and the outputs are this".

Why "Signing the input scripts as well would obviously make it
impossible to construct a transaction"?
I don't understand that part. I think a new SIGHASH_* type that
doesn't pay attention to that "obviously" is needed to achieve what we
want.

Say we want the following transaction:

A 1 satoshi -> B 1 satoshi -> C 100 btc -> A

It would be necessary to sign the following:

Inputs: from srcA, from srcB,
Outputs: 1 satoshi to destB, 1 satoshi to destC, 100 btc to destA

"from srcC" is not really necessary.

This same scheme can be used for n-hops.

What am I missing?
