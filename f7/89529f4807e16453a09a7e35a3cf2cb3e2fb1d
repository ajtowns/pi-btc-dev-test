Luke's proposed changes to BIP8 (specifically, the FAILING state) seem designed to address the regression compared to BIP9 that there is no way to avoid activating a softfork that is shown to be suboptimal or flawed in some (serious enough) way - after deployment is well underway - without hardforking.
I agree with your principle but we should also look at the circumstances in which this mechanism would be beneficial vs. when it would cause harm (compared to BIP8 without this mechanism). The scenario this was designed for is "miners refusing to activate, on non-technical grounds, a widely desired upgrade" - in which case the "wakeup call" would be in users' hands, not anyone in particular.
Is there a hypothetical scenario in which the orphan risk outweighs the benefits of having this kind of upgrade mechanism that can (at deploy-time) be chosen to be optional by default with a deferred mechanism to make it mandatory? If so, is there any thought on how to realize the latter without the former?
