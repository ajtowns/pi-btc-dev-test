Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Introducing Hive, a new wallet for Mac OS X
Message-ID: <47608B02-CF00-4AA6-BDFE-0EE09C7E2DBF@grabhive.com>

Hi everyone,

We have pushed out our first test release of Hive, a new OS X wallet focused on usability and discovery:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=304060

Hive is powered by a new version of our BitcoinKit.framework, updated recently with bitcoinj support.

Memory of a famous Reid Hoffman quote implores us to reveal that Hive is still missing _many_ basic features. This is not a release that you should give to anyone for serious use. We wanted to get the ball rolling with the community as early as possible, to gather feedback -- and hopefully a little assistance!

Thanks to everyone at Bitcoin Europe 2013 for the feedback and moral support!

PS- If you're interested in including an app for your Bitcoin-supporting service in Hive, please be in touch!
