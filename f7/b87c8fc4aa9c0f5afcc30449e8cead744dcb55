So, OP, in your scenario, you have 1 transaction in the mempool, A, then
you want to spend the change before confirmation, so you broadcast a new
transaction, B, which replaces A.

> Because the size of the merged transaction is smaller than the original
transactions, unless there is a considerable feerate bump, this rule isn't
possible to observe.

I'm confused, the mempool only sees 1 transaction at a time, first A, then
later B. " the original transactions", plural, should not exist in the
mempool.

B's fee and rate needs to be larger than A's, but B will be greater than or
equal to A anyway. So, just increasing the fee rate will cause a larger fee
anyway.

Am I missing something?
