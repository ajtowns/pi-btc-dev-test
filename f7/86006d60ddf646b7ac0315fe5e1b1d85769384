Note that Bitcoin source and binary downloads are protected by both the
PGP WoT and the certificate authority PKI system. The binaries are
hosted on bitcoin.org, which is https and protected by a the PKI system,
and the source code is hosted on github, again, https protected. A MITM
attack would need to compromise the PKI system as well, at least
provided users aren't fooled into downloading over http.
