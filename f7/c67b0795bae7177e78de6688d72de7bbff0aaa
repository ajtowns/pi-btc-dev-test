Gregory,

you are good at language and its easy to write eloquent words.

Looking at this little dialog, for instance;

This *seems* to read like the same thing. But it is not.  Your version is more 
polarizing and changes the intent quite dramatically.

It is an eloquent change, but not really the topic we were discussing. It also 
makes you attack Mike (calling him out as having a strawman) without basis.
For the second time in this thread. 
I would suggest arguing on the topic, not on the man.
