The largest output on testnet is a bit under 1MB, and encodes a certain
well-known love song...

In many circumstances(1) miners have an incentive to create larger blocks that
take their competitors longer to receive and validate, so protocol-level block
limits need to take all these potential DoS vectors into account; serialized
size is one of the most fundemental things that needs to be limited.

As mentioned above, and explained in detail in my recent blog post(1),
restrictions are needed to keep a level playing field between all miners.
