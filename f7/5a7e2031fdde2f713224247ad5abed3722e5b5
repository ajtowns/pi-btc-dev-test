I never said that Bitcoin message field lengths should always be the same. But before this change they certainly were constant per protocol version. All I'm saying is that optional lengths shouldn't be used (a field exists or not) and for every field change, the protocol version should be upgraded.

Now that fRelayTxes is part of the protocol, the version number should be upgraded to reflect this fact.

If you want to criticise the Bitcoin protocol for sloppyness, the variable length of some messages isn't where I'd start.

Note that ping has the same issue, its length has changed over time to include the nonce.

If your parser can't handle that kind of thing, you need to fix it. The protocol has always worked that way.

What happens in the future when new fields are added to the version message? It's not a big deal to say that this protocol version has X number of fields, that (higher) protocol version message has X + N number of fields. Deterministic number of fields per protocol version is sensical and how Bitcoin has been for a long time.

Nowhere was this written. It doesn't help other implementations to have an unclear behaviour that depends on some magic from one implementation.

This is not only easier for parsing messages, but just good practice. I don't see why a 1 byte flag needs to be optional anyway.
