This doesn't work like you might think: first of all, the fees today are 
greatly subsidized - the actual cost to store data in the blockchain is much 
higher than most storage solutions. Secondly, only the miner receives the 
fees, not the majority of nodes which have to bear the burden of the data.
That is, the fee system is setup as an antispam/deterrant, not as payment for 
storage.

Not the same thing at all; nobody is forced to store/relay video/voice/images 
without reimbursement. On the other hand, any full Bitcoin node is required to 
at least download the entire blockchain once. And the network as a whole 
suffers if nodes decide to start not-storing parts of the blockchain they 
don't want to deal with.

This is how merged mining solves the problem. A single extra hash in the 
coinbase can link the bitcoin blockchain up with unlimited other data.

See above.
