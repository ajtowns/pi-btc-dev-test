You seem to misunderstand the usecase.
If you send me a transaction, both of use are using our phones, then I need 
to be able to have immediate feedback on the transaction being broadcast on 
the network.
This is not about zero-conf, this is simple seeing what is happening while 
it is happening.

Additionally, when the transaction that is meant for my wallet is broadcast, 
I want my SPV wallet to parse and check the actual transaction.
It is not just to see that *something* was actually send, but also to be 
able to see how much is being paid to me. Maybe If the transaction is marked 
as RBF-able, etc.

Really basic usability: provide information to your users when you can, 
should they want to, and by default on.
