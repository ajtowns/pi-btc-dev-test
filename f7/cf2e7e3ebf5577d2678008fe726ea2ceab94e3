I'd also like to see some more formal analysis of the notion that "$10 in
the hand of 10 people is more than $50 in the hand of two, or $100 in the
hand of one". I think this encapsulates the security assumption on why we
want decentralization at all.

This is a very critical property bitcoin exploits for being able to
transact large amounts, among other things. (Closely related is the notion
that defecting will destroy all the value...)
