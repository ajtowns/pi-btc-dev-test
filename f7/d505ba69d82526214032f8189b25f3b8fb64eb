Well done Gavin for quickly setting the record straight[1] officially as
project lead. MtGox tried to blame their issues by throwing Bitcoin under a
bus and I am glad there has been a public rebuttal showing up their
incompetence which is doing harm to the bitcoin eco system. Basically, yes
there are issues, but MtGox should have worked around it.

Also thanks to Gregory for also writing[2] about the matter.
