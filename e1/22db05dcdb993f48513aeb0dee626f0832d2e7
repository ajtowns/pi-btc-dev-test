Diverging from the satoshi block size change plan[1] and current economics
would seem to require a high level of months-ahead communication to users.

Segregated Witness does not kick the can, it solves none of the problems
#1, #3 - #8 explicitly defined and listed in email #1.

1)  A plan of "SW + no hard fork" is gambling with ECE risk, gambling there
will be no Fee Event, because the core block size is still heavily
contended -- 100% contended at time out SW rollout.

2) We are only 100% certain that bitcoin works in the
blocks-not-full-on-avg state, where there is a healthy buffer between the
hard limit and the average block size.

There is remains major ECE risk due to the core block size freeze, possibly
pushing the system into a new, untried economic state and causing major
market and actor disruption.  Users of the Service can still drift randomly
and unpredictably into a Fee Event.

SW mitigates this
- only after several months
- only assuming robust adoption rates by up-layer ecosystem software, and
- only assuming transaction volume growth is flat or sub-linear

Those conditions *must* go as planned to fulfill "SW kicked the can" -- a
lot of if's.

As stated, SW is orthogonal to the drift-into-uncharted-waters problem
outlined in email #1, which a short term bump does address.
