Disagree with treating the "version" field as a number, in BIP 9 or this BIP 
which reinterpret it as a bit vector.

Minor nit (not relevant to actual proposal): This is not true. There are over 
32 other bits (part of the "previous-block" field) which also serve no 
purpose.

With the current codebase, it is significantly easier to trigger on the block 
timestamp rather than its height or median-time-past. Using either of the 
latter would require refactoring of CBlockIndex. As a hard-fork, even if the 
rules are ineffective for a few blocks following the forking point, using the 
hardfork version bit in this BIP would still ensure a clean break. While I 
agree that median-time-past and height are superior methods that ought to be 
used for hardforks, an emergency hardfork may need to avoid them for 
simplicity, and I don't think they need to be mandated as such in this BIP.

I would avoid implying the hardfork can be "officially deployed" without 
actual adoption.

This seems vulnerable to DoS attacks by rejected hardforks.

Rather not imply BIP 9 should be used for hardforks, or that miners have any 
voice in the decision. This is already a serious misconception.

This is not actually desirable, and would suggest a possible reason *not* to 
comply with this BIP. A legitimate hardfork would never have two continued 
sets of rules for miners to choose from.
