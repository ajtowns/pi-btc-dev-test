Because I was designing a system under the assumption that you were
highly likely to connect to an attacker at some point, and the trade-off
available with the available math was to either give very detailed info
to that attacker, or give away some probabalistic info to everyone.

Quite likely - I think most of this disagreement stems from the fact
that we have different starting assumptions. In particular my assumption
that you are likely to end up connecting to an attacker logging data,
and my desire to have a standard that can be implemented with existing
cryptographic primatives. Remember that I'm spending a lot of time
working with wallet authors; they have approximately zero interest in
standards that require crypto any more fancy than HD wallets do.

Scanning performance is different from bandwidth performance. Prefix
brute-forcing was designed to address the latter concern for cases where
you are bandwidth limited and don't have a trusted peer to do the
scanning for you.
