Nobody is preventing anyone from claiming anything. Some developers
are encouraging users to ask for bigger blocks.
Others don't want to impose consensus rule changes against the will of
the users (even if they're 10% of the users).
Still, "Things apparently aren't bad enough" is just your opinion.

1) I don't care what the so-called "majority" thinks: I don't want to
impose consensus rule changes against the will of a reasonable
minority.
2) It doesn't matter who is to blame about the current centralization:
the fact remains that the blocksize maximum is the only** consensus
rule to limit mining centralization.
3) In fact I think Luke Dashjr proposed to reduced it to 400 KB, but I
would ask the same thing: please create a simulation in which the
change is better (or at least no much worse) than the current rules by
ANY metric.

Please read the point 2 with special attention because it's not the
first time I say this in this thread.

** There's also the maximum block sigops consensus rule to limit
mining centralization.
