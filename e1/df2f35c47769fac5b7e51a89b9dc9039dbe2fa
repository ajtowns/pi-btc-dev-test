Yes, discussion for the BIP still happens on the mailing list.

Weak? What does that even mean? GitHub's terms are no trivial list. It's not a 
matter of "easy", but whether you're willing to agree to the terms or not - 
and people should be free to participate without doing so. The Bitcoin Wiki 
has never had a problem with whitelisting people, and isn't exclusively 
available via IRC.

GitHub's collaborative features for the wiki function is clearly inferior.

Then you're essentially standing in the way of BIP 2 and stalling it.

I have no interest in having to manually approve every single little comment 
on BIPs, and I think it's likely nobody will use it if doing so requires such 
effort.
