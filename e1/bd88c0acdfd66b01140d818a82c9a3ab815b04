As far as I can see, that state is gone, and is now passed in a
separate object to the transaction-creation methods.

I'd like to see it go in, as I believe it can be helpful in
understanding the difference between the high-level abstraction
(wallet) and the underlying implementation (individual coins) -
something that many people are confused about. I think that's even a
more important advantage than the ability for micro-management it
offers. Multiwallet would be more appropriate for avoiding linkage
between identities, but it seems there's little progress on that front
now.
