Subject: [bitcoin-dev] On bitcoin-dev list admin and list noise
Message-ID: <CADm_Wcbf+p=ShdfQqKzbWPvVWJ6WMxR2dF4Y4M5N+yzoqZtTCw@mail.gmail.com>

This was discussed in IRC, but (did I miss it?) never made it to the list
outside of being buried in a longer summary.

There is a common complain that bitcoin-dev is too noisy.  The response
plan is to narrow the focus of the list to near term technical changes to
the bitcoin protocol and its implementations (bitcoin core, btcd, ...)

Debates over bitcoin philosophy, broader context, etc. will start seeing
grumpy list admins squawk about "off-topic!"

It is a fair criticism, though, that "take it elsewhere!" needs to have
some place as a suggested destination.  The proposal is to create a second
list, bitcoin-tech-discuss or perhaps just 'bitcoin', with a more general
rubric.  This split has served IRC well and generally manages to keep the
noise down to a productive level.  We want this list to achieve that same
goal; if bitcoin-dev is not productive then it's not useful.
