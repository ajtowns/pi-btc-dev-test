Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP status updates & BIP 2 activation
Message-ID: <201611301020.31747.luke@dashjr.org>

To conclude discussion on BIP 2, I have opened a pull request to implement it 
and mark it active. Note this implies activation and implementation of BIP 123 
as well: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/478

I plan to merge this on December 14th. If there are any hard objections to 
this change, please bring it up on the bitcoin-dev mailing list before then. 
Further reviews of the implementation are welcome in the meantime. Please 
refrain from requesting further changes to the BIPs themselves unless it is a 
blocker/show-stopper or trivial (not changing the meaning).

In the process of implementing BIP 2, I came across a number of BIPs which 
managed to get into the repository without a proper license. Authors of any of 
these BIPs should open a pull request adding the necessary Copyright section 
and License header(s). (If there are other contributors to the document in the 
BIP git logs, I will try to reach out to them to get permission. If you have 
accepted contributions from anyone not documented in git as an Author, please 
mention this in the PR explicitly.)

These BIPs need a license:
