Well in the case of coinbase transactions we want them to be dependent on
the height they are included in, which is not a problem since they are only
valid in conjunction with the block that mined them.

No need to add an extra field to the transaction just to include the
height. We can just add a rule that the height specified in the scriptSig
in coinbase transactions (and only coinbase transactions) is copied into
the locktime of the transaction before computing the normalized transaction
ID and leave the locktime untouched for all normal transactions

Sounds reasonable :-)
