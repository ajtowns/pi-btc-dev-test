OKAY.  The only tweet I was shown was this one:

https://twitter.com/sickpig/status/1043428373530390528

It doesn't many any mention to him not reporting it and I encountered
it in the context of another person citing it to claim it had been
reported.

Yes, in fact I referred to the that specifically in my message as well
as including his entire message in my post.

I'm unclear what you're now stating. Are you stating that awemany knew
that it could
cause inflation but indicated otherwise to us or are you stating that
he did not know and
in the abundance of caution he sent the report as fast as possible
before making that
determination?

I'm just asking because I'm confused by your response; I don't think
it's particularly important one way or another.
