HCE is a bit scary. It's like the card companies tried the secure element
thing, decided the security was too hard and were like "screw it, let's
just use regular apps after all". Not that we're any better :)

At any rate, Bitcoin doesn't have any need to emulate smartcards as we
don't have any pre-existing infrastructure. We can just use a regular
non-smarcard-emulation ISO-DEP protocol. The new UI in Android 4.4 provides
some way to choose the default payment app, but I think it's only intended
to disambiguate between credit card providers. Everything else gets dumped
into CATEGORY_OTHER and I dunno what happens if you have multiple Bitcoin
wallet apps doing the same thing. Worst case, we can add some
disambiguation code on top, inside the apps themselves.
