Update:

(1) and (3) are doable, however, Debian and Ubuntu policies make (2)
very difficult (with the exception of security patches). Micha Bailey
and I worked to get bitcoin removed from Debian and Ubuntu stable
releases because they would not allow (2). There are other mechanisms
that could accomplish (2) (backports, volatile, and updates
repositories), however they are not enabled by default and require
user intervention.

Debian unstable does allow (2) since there is no release, and there is
a package in Debian unstable. That package is blocked from
transitioning to a stable release. We've also blacklisted it from
Ubuntu so that Ubuntu doesn't just autoimport and release the Debian
unstable package in an Ubuntu stable release.

Micha is also working to have all old versions of bitcoin removed from
previous released Ubuntu versions.

Matt C's PPA is the best way of getting (1-3) above on Ubuntu, and the
Debian unstable package is probably the best way of getting (1-3)
above in Debian. Both require users to add a line to their apt sources
list; the Debian package would also require apt pinning.
