Hey Tom,

Thanks for getting involved! It's great to see someone who would like to
focus on docs.

One project I've been thinking about recently is a "Bitcoin Developer
Network" subsection of our website. Right now bitcoin.org is entirely
consumer focused. And as you noted, the wiki is undergoing some kind of
heart attack - it's not an ideal medium for professional docs anyway.

So it's too hard to learn how to work with Bitcoin as a developer, and we
could really benefit from professionally curated web content. We have a
great web dev in the form of Saivann, who recently got some sponsorship
from the Foundation to spend time on the website, so I'm hoping that if we
find people to produce the content then he can with the visual design and
we could create something really special.

If you're interested in this let me know.
