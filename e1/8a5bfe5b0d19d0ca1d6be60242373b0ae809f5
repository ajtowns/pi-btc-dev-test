Here are some additional use cases:

* Long term lock funds, requiring signatures from 2 officers of a company
to disburse (2 of n for n between 3 and 20)

* Short term lock funds, with 2-factor auth to disburse and an additional
2 of n backup in case one of the factors is lost (2-of-2 OR 2-of-n)

* "Escrow" with the the two parties having to agree or one of two backup
observers helping in case of disagreement (2-of-2 OR 2-of-3 OR 2-of-3)

* An options contract where the outcome is triggered by a key being
broadcast: (Ks AND K1) OR (Kr AND K2) - s gets control of funds if K1 is
broadcast, r gets control if K2 is broadcast.
