I would like to second this point...privacy is essential because the market
demands it.  If Bitcoin doesn't do it well (and I would argue that it
doesn't today), then eventually a competitor to Bitcoin will do it better
and that would be the beginning of the end for Bitcoin.  Debates about
whether it was or wasn't a core feature are pointless.
