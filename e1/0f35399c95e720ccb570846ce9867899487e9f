Yes.

A simple guarantee of 1:1 correspondence between request and response.
 The bitcoin protocol sometimes simply elides a response when the
response would be empty, and this makes it difficult to know whether a
request is timing out or already processed.

Sending a ping(nonce) after each P2P command is another way of achieving same :)

An nServices bit would be a better fit for this optional service, but
nServices bits seemed like a scarce resource, so I elected to be
conservative.

Absent the scarce-resource concern, I'd vote for an nServices bit.
