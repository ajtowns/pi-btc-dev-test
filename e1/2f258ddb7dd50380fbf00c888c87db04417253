I may be able to provide some insight regarding request volume / abuse via my public node at http://statoshi.info

My node receives a 'getaddr' request about every 50 seconds: http://i.imgur.com/XEpnWfG.png

In terms of the 'addr' messages that it sends out, the volume is also low. This graph has 'inv' and 'tx' sent messages for comparison. http://i.imgur.com/keyitsS.png

Now, these are just message volume and not actual resource usage, but I have a feeling that 'getaddr' requests are not resource intensive since it shouldn't be reading from disk. I could look into adding timing metrics around these requests if you think it could be useful.
