Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Deprecating Bitcoin Core's
 regtest-specific `setgenerate` behaviour

I would recommend adding the new method and deprecating (as in warning
against using) the old one for one major release. Then removing it
altogether in the following major release.

I have written a Java RPC client and Groovy/Spock functional tests
<https://github.com/msgilligan/bitcoin-spock> that use the current call.
A separate `generate` or `generateblocks` call is a great idea.

However, I try to keep my tests compatible with the current stable and
unstable versions of Bitcoin Core (and the Omni Core fork) and would
have to write code that checks the RPC server version (or checks for the
presence of the new call, falling back to the old one) to support the
use cases that I need to support. Not a huge deal, but I'm probably not
the only one.
