I thought this had already been covered up-thread?

When creating something that must be hashed and/or compared, the data
structure must be created and reproduced precisely, byte-for-byte.
JSON offers significant -disadvantages- in this regard.  With JSON,
you would therefore require an additional middle layer, between JSON
and application, ensuring that all fields are output in the same
order, all whitespace is not only perfectly preserved -- but reliably
generates identical whitespace output for identical inputs, given two
separate JSON implementations.
