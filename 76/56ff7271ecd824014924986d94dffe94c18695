A couple of half-baked thoughts:

I'd encourage you to code up a prototype first (or at the same time), in
whatever programming language / networking library you're most familiar
with.

Maybe not even using the existing p2p protocol; there could be a
mining-only very-fast-block-propagation network separate from the existing
p2p network.

Combining your optimizations with "broadcast as many near-miss blocks as
bandwidth will allow" on a mining backbone network should allow insanely
fast propagation of most newly solved blocks.
