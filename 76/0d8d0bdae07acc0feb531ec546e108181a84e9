Re-reading this, even with the most recent message, is still isn't
clear _precisely_ how your technology works, or why it is better than
namecoin.  User profiles (and distributed ledgers) need to reflect the
latest updates, and a stream of updates of over time is precisely what
bitcoin technology secures.

Keys expire or are compromised, and the public ledger needs to reflect
that.  There is a lot of computer science involved in making sure the
public ledger you see is not an outdated view.  A log-like stream of
changes is not the only way to do things, but other methods need less
hand-wavy details (show the code) before they are well recognized as
useful.

But they do have a specific use case and that is to provide "advanced knowledge" of a publickey that can be used for encrypting a message to an intended recipient, without the requirement for a third-party CA, and more importantly without prior dialogue. We think it is this that would allow you to communicate a pay-to address to someone without seeing them in a secure way.
