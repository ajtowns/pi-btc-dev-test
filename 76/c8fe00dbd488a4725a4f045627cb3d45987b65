For someone with 'Chief Scientist' as their job title, I'm surprised you
think so little of hard evidence and so much of idol worshipping.


P.S. A year or so ago you complained that if I cared so much about
decentralization, I should make P2Pool better. Your homework: What do
tree-chains and Andrew Miller's non-outsourcable puzzles(1) have to do
with that? What about the cube-square law? And why don't I think TXO
commitments solve the blocksize problem?
