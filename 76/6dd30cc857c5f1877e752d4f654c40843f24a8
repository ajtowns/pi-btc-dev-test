Although it currently does not seem to be used that way, I'd like to see
merchants sign their payment requests but store them on their payment
processors server. Currently if you buy from Humble Bundle, all you see
is Coinbase which is unfortunate.

I think that's unrealistic. HTTP is already in use, and also the
proposed spec is open to other transports, e.g. Bluetooth which is also
already in common use.
