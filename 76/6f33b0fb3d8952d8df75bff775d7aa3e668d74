Are you saying your proposal is intentionally not intended to reflect the 
reality? I wasn't talking about a "current state of affairs" for BIPs as much 
as that that the acceptance of BIPs is *defined by* the state of affairs.

Overall, I think something *similar to* this proposal is a good idea, but I 
disagree with how this proposal currently approaches the problem. Instead, 
what I would recommend is a specification based on BIP 123 that specifies the 
conditions under which a proposal is *known to be* accepted by the community 
(ie, discerning, not deciding), and establishes a way for a committee to 
review the BIP and *determine* if these conditions have been met. This would 
avoid a "disconnect" between the "official status" and reality, making the BIP 
process more useful to everyone.

Reviewing your current proposal:

As mentioned, IMO a committee shouldn't be indicating acceptance, as much as 
it should be *determining* acceptance.

1% seems like an awful lot to dedicate to BIP status changes.

That sounds very time consuming. And what happens if these committees don't 
represent the community? What about when only part of the community - let's 
say 10% - decides to adopt a BIP that doesn't require consensus? Logically 
that BIP should still proceed...

But the Bitcoin user base is completely unknown, and tracking software user 
base is a privacy violation.

Bitcoin economic activity is also unknown, and it seems likely that merchants 
consider their own activity confidential.

> Mining: proof of work (Min 1% of Hashpower)

This needs a proper specification. How do miners express their positions?

Chosen how, and by whom?

Until this BIP is active, its rules do not apply, so this would be a form of 
circular reasoning. I like the idea of putting conditions for activation in 
the BIP text, but I don't think we can just let the author set any conditions 
they like either...
