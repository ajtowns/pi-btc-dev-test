Hello Matt,

The results of my paper hold unless the information about the included transactions is identically zero.  If this information is extremely small, then I agree that something other than the orphan cost would drive the fee market. I don't think this will ever by the case, however.

In this paragraph, you are talking about intra-miner communication (you refer to other nodes "of theirs").   I agree that this can be very fast because there's only one entity involved.

I look forward to hearing your talk about the Relay Network.  Let's image there was no block size limit.  Using the Relay Network as it currently operates now, how big would the block solution announcement be:

(1) if a miner published a 10 MB block where 100% of the transactions are known by the other nodes?  

(2) if a miner published a 10 MB block where 90% of the transactions are known by the other nodes?  

(3) if a miner published a 100 MB spam block where 0% of the transactions are known by the other nodes?

Best regards,
Peter
