The additional material _IS_ then part of the private key. It's not
something seperate. Its something you need to know in order to author
the address.  This was fundamentally my argument. Not that you could
hide information, but that information was already hidden.

Right now under conventional uses I can't identify all the
transactions that land in your wallet, because I don't know the keys
it contains. With the proposal it's the same situation.

These projects will be able to use the _same_ procedure to extract the
identifying information. Except now instead of
ripemd160(sha256(pubkey)) it will be more like ripemd160(sha256([some
extra bytes generated by the wallet holder]||pubkey)) that you
extract.  If the former is not a problem for these applications, why
is the latter?
