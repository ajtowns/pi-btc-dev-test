No, Bitcoin classic only activates if 75% of the _miners_ adopt it. That
says nothing about the broader network and indeed is much easier to achieve

hashrate is ultimately only a dozen people or so.

You have plenty of channels through which you can make your announcements,
this particular one is not okay.
