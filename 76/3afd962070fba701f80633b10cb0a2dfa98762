Subject: [Bitcoin-development] bitcoin DNS addresses
Message-ID: <CAJ1JLts5_r6hHoJR-gS-CuuvS00p=RQ6iYbCyOkBDcvgs1xtew@mail.gmail.com>

I've just joined the list with the goals of producing a patch to
sendtoaddress in rpc.cpp to support DNS lookups so that one could publish a
TXT record in the DNS with their wallet address to facilitate sending of
coin.

I'm proposing something like the code below, which works but needs
additional error handling.

also working on a internet-draft to describe how to put bitcoin addresses in
the DNS which I hope to post the first draft of this week.

I'd appreciate comments on issues around annomity, community push back and
any other issues you might have with leveraging the DNS for bitcoin
transactions.

thanks,

[comment-to]\n"
           "<amount> is a real and is rounded to the nearest 0.00000001");
