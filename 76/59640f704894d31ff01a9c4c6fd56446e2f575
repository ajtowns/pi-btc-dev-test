Senders have no interest in ever attaching any kind of fee, which is one
reason we explored child-pays-for-parent for a while. It's not the sender
who cares about double spending risk. Left to their own devices, all
senders would always attach no fee at all (or rather: whatever the min was
to get the transaction relayed to the merchant).

However, receivers do want a fee attached, and ideally we would do this
without redundant transactions. Hence, receivers asking senders to attach a
fee and effectively folding it into the price that is paid. That is, if you
go into a restaurant and the menu says "Burger: 10mBTC" then when you come
to pay, what you see on your phone screen is 10mBTC. The fact that actually
the shop with receiver 9.9mBTC and the tx fee is 0.1mBTC is hidden in the
user interface - creating a situation like many others, where receivers eat
a transaction cost. For instance in Europe sales taxes are included in the
price, not attached separately later.

There's no need to trust the vendor. If a vendor asks for a ridiculously
high tx fee, it will just surface as uncompetitively priced goods/services.
Buyers will go elsewhere.

That's what fee estimation does, essentially, minus the encoding into
blocks. Once you start getting miners telling people what fees are directly
you run into cases where they might try to lie about their behaviour or
otherwise influence the average. Querying all nodes avoids that problem.
