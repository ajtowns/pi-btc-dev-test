I mentioned this in my reply to Pieter, but this may not be true if we
remove the blanking of the `hashSequence` field. Anyonecanpay would
allow changing the number of inputs in an arbitrary fashion, while
`noinput` without the blanking would (in a weird roundabout way) still
commit to the number of inputs. Maybe we want to make that more explicit
by also hashing the number of inputs? But I can't think of a good
usecase for keeping that, with noinput.

Cheers,
Christian
