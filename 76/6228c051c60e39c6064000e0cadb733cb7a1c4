I agree with Luke: make the rules only apply to transactions with a
strict nVersion==3. If we want to extend that later we can do so in
another soft-fork.


On another topic, I'm skeptical of the choice of nVersion==3 - we'll
likely end up doing more block.nVersion increases in the future, and
there's no reason to think they'll have anything to do with
transactions. No sense creating a rule that'll be so quickly broken.
