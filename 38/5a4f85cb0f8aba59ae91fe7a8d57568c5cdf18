Do mind that some of the steps on the path of bitcoind towards SPV are
also useful in general. For example, headers-first allows parallel
block download, which would solve a lot of sync issues people are
having - a much higher priority than the wallet.

But anyhow I'm describing how I would do it. If you're going to do it,
you can do it in any order that you want. As we're talking about a
separate project here it's not even clear who will be maintainer.

I don't understand your argument against Electrum here. Dependencies?
Come on, that's a matter of software distribution. If that really
bothers you I suppose you could contribute to Electrum server so that
it has less deps. It doesn't make the protocol worth any less.

Although Pieter and I disagree with regard to issue #4351, we agree on
wanting to keep (or at least making) bitcoind as lean as possible.
Maintaining extra indices for others doesn't fit in there - that's
also why the address index patch was not merged. An 'index node' could
be a different animal.
