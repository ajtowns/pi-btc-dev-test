that my BIP is unneeded, so I'm not sure it would be worth the effort for
me to improve it with your suggestions.

I think it should be made an option (with the default being that the
threshold is given and verification is applied. There could certainly be a
few cases where the threshold is set high, you maybe don't have access to a
great enough variety of hiding spots or secure enough hiding spots, and you
want deter an attempt to find all the shares (with the idea being that the
risk of detection would be too high, in particular when you use tamper
evident seals). But for the majority it would be better to find a few
different safeboxes to put the shares in and rely on physical security.
