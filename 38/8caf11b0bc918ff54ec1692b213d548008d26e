Subject: [bitcoin-dev] [RFC] Lightning invoice/payment format draft
In-Reply-To: <874lw0h4y3.fsf@rustcorp.com.au>
References: <874lw0h4y3.fsf@rustcorp.com.au>

In order for such messages to be dispatchable between apps, I suggest
prepending with an URI scheme, similar to the already existing
"bitcoin:" scheme.

Also I suggest defining a MIME type, e.g. for usage in NFC NDEF messages
or emails.

What is the relation of this BIP to BIP21 and BIP70-72? Is there a
reason for not extending BIP70?
