See bip2, specifically
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki#bip-workflow

"Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the BIPs
git repository as a pull request. This draft must be written in BIP
style as described below, and named with an alias such as
"bip-johndoe-infinitebitcoins" until the editor has assigned it a BIP
number (authors MUST NOT self-assign BIP numbers)."

But I think it's kind of late to modify bip141, given that there's
code out there with the current specification.
I guess you can propose extensions or alternatives to replace it. I'm
really not sure what's the next step, but I don't think you have
provided enough motivation as to why we would want to maintain
asicboost. You said it makes the network more secure, but that's not
the case, as explained, not even if all honest miners use it.
