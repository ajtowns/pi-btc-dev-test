On the subject of unexpected results, for the longest time wikipedia
had problems with images randomly not displaying for some users.

Images were stored by their cryptographic hash. If the hash was
deadbeef the URL would be:

/d/de/deadbeef.jpg

Turns out that a lot of people are running addons that block /a/ad/  ...

Not running afoul of various censorware filters should be a design
target too, as insane as it seems. Simply because "The key is
'Tienanmen Square people monkey'"  "People monkey isn't working!" is a
hard situation to trouble shoot!
