When I read this, I get the impression that you (and possibly many
others) never actually understood the Bitcoin security model in the
first place.

Bitcoin is a digital cash system that prevents double spending without
using a trusted third party.

More specifically, successful double spending in Bitcoin requires an
attacker to pay a proof of work cost that exceeds the cumulative proof
of work paid by all non-attackers since the original spend.

The security model holds for any user who has access to the complete
blockchain, and currently does not hold for all users who do not. An
attacker can double spend without paying the full PoW cost the security
model requires if users do not have a full copy of the blockchain which
which to verify the attacker's blocks.

That's a problem, but it's not an unfixable problem.

The reason an attacker can fool SPV clients into accepting invalid
blocks is because there exists no mechanism via which honest nodes can
prove the invalidity of blocks.

Implement that mechanism, and the security of SPV clients will far more
closely resemble the security of full nodes.
