Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin cookbook
Message-ID: <CA+8xBpccs4ru1h9sYnXZ6F+MmECTt_KM=BUgWxqvE9N=99AGFw@mail.gmail.com>

Created a forum thread "Bitcoin cookbook", to collect real world, step
by step examples of some of the more advanced uses of bitcoin:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=118126.0

If you have a recipe to contribute, create a new thread, then mention
your thread in the cookbook.

Maybe some of this will migrate to the wiki, but the wiki itself tends
to be a poor place for discussion and questions.
