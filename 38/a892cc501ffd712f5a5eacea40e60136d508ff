I agree, it looks very slick.  Well done.

While on the subject of connected peers, what about the idea of adding the ping time from this node to other peers?  The problem with fitting that information into the current design is that the graphs seem to be comprised of overall statistics for this node, not per-peer statistics that can vary between peers (such as ping time).  If a line were to be added to a graph to represent each peer's ping time, the number of lines (statistics) on the graph would have to vary in real time as peers are added or removed, which would be a challenge.

I earlier added the "ping" feature to bitcoind, and it works to measure the ping time, however this feature is on-demand: it won't ping other nodes unless requested.  So, something would have to send the "ping" RPC command on a regular schedule, to ensure the graph is updated with new information.  Also, there is currently no support for overlapping pings (although that would be easy to add), so if a peer is slow enough to not respond at all to the first ping request, and a second ping request goes out in the meantime, any late response from the first ping request would then be discarded.

Great graphs, and these are just brainstorms for future ideas :)
