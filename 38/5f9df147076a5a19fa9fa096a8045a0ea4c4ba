Not really. BIP140 might be easier to implement, but in longterm the UTXO overhead is significant and unnecessary. There are also other benefits of segwit written in BIP141. Some of those are applicable even if you are making a new coin.

Instead, the normalised txid (i.e. txid with scriptSig removed) is used when making signature. Comparing with segwit (BIP141), BIP140 does not have the side-effect of block size increase, and doesn?t provide any incentive to control the size of UTXO set. Also, BIP140 makes the UTXO set permanently bigger, as the database needs to store both txid and normalised txid
