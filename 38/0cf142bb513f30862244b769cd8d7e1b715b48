Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Request for Comments: Mastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition
Message-ID: <CAFmyj8wyEwP1-zywTXFBxyCj1gcEfqAbbGD4oERijBFS87J1Gg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm requesting feedback and corrections for the second edition of
"Mastering Bitcoin". Apologies if this is considered off-topic - it is only
my second message to this list in 4 years and I think it is relevant
because this book is the first source of information for many new bitcoin
developers.

The book is in pre-production and will be published within the next 6-8
weeks. The new edition covers many new topics including segwit, bip9
signalling, timelocks, payment channels & lightning network. In addition,
most chapters have seen big changes, clarifications and corrections.

The book is open source (CC-BY-SA) and produced on github (
https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/tree/develop). Pull requests,
issues and comments are welcome, only 2-3 weeks left before it goes into a
production freeze.

Many thanks,

Andreas
