We've discussed this before: that rule prevents bandwidth usage DoS attacks on
the mempool; it's not a "heuristic". If you drop it, an attacker can repeatedly
broadcast and replace a series of transactions to use up tx relay bandwidth for
significantly lower cost than otherwise.

Though these days with relatively high minimum fees that may not matter.
