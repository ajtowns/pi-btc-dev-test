I find it more likely that fake PGP keys are from corporate industrial 
espionage and/or organized crime outfits. Intelligence agencies will stick
to compromised X509, network cards, and binary code blobs.

Besides, why would an intelligence agency want your bitcoin when they can 
just intercept ASIC miners and make their own?

Uhhmm, real operating system use package managers with PGP instead of pre-
compromised X.509 nonsense. https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt
