BIPs were based on Python PIPs, PIPs use this same ordering but spell out
the month like '1-Oct-2000'. This is slightly more readable than our format.

http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0453/

But to make it more confusing they have two different date conventions
within the header (one for the modified date, and one for the created date).

Personally I'd prefer to standardize on ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) dates as well.

Feel free to submit a pull against bips/bips that changes around the dates.
