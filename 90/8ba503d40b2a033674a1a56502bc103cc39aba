Possibly, but in the IPFS case I suspect the latency required to inspect
all hashes would likely  impact the ability of the miner to succeed in the
block. (True? I don?t touch mining software.)

Thus as long as all hashes look the same, and there are multiple content
addressable schemes that use hashes that have to be searched in order to
know to censor, you have to censor all or none.
