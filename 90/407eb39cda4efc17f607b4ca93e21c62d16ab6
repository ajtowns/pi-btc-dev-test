OK I pulled a couple other minor bits.

The only remaining question, IMO, is whether or not we should pull

     Make UPnP default on Bitcoin but not on Bitcoind.
     https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/372

We are all kicking the can on this decision to Gavin I believe <grin>
I think the two strong arguments for upnp are
     - other p2p apps widely deployed, notably skype, use it
     - it will make a significant positive impact in the number of
       nodes supporting incoming connections

so my personal (read: not speaking for anyone else) opinion is to turn
on upnp for bitcoin _and_ bitcoind.
