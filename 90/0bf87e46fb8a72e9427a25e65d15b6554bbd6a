You can, but as reviewing can take a while, the github model works better
for this project.

In my experience people lose track of patches sent to mailing lists, at
least when posted to github there will be a nagging 'issue' appearing until
it is either merged or closed otherwise.

If it concerns a proposed protocol change do discuss it on the mailing
list, as people building other implementations read here and not on github.
