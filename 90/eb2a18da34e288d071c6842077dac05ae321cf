I think this is unreasonable. There is a straight-forward soft-fork
approach which is safe (e.g. no risk of invalidating existing
transactions). Yes, it means that you need to use newly created
addresses to get coins that use the new signature type... but thats
only the case for people who want the new capability. This is
massively preferable to expecting _every_ _other_ user of the system
(including miners, full nodes, etc.) to replace their software with an
incompatible new version just to accommodate your transactions, for
which they may care nothing about and which would otherwise not have
any urgent need to change.

I've expected this need to be addressed simply as a side effect of a
new, more efficient, checksig operator which some people have been
working on and off on but which has taken a backseat to other more
urgent issues.

Can you help me understand whats taking 40 minutes here? Thats a
surprisingly high number, and so I'm wondering if I'm not missing
something there.
