I don't see any basis for these claims.  Under this theory developers 
also do not "participate in the economy" either.  These are questions 
for economists and not developers.

Maybe "we" could change the language of Core to prevent the 
centralization of developers?  Maybe switch over to FORTRAN?   lol
