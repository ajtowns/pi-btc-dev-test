That would be fine as well. Although I would prefer if one could
query for a specific transaction id, whether it comes from a trusted
source and also from which trusted source, as you might want to
keep track of the amount of unconfirmed funds you are currently
accepting from a specific source (or the Bitcoin daemon could
keep track of that as well, either way is fine).

This sounds a little too involved though, for my level of familiarity
with the Bitcoin source code and C++, to implement myself.

Regards,
Jan
