I was wondering about that too, but it turns out that isn't necessary. At
least in Bitcoin Core, all the data needed for such a filter is in the
block + undo files (the latter contain the scriptPubKeys of the outputs
being spent).

I have a script running to compare the filter sizes assuming the regular

That's very helpful, thank you.
