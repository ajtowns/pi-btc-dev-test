Hi,

There is currently 5 alerts pages on bitcoin.org concerning past network
events (vulnerabilities, hard fork, etc.). Those don't have any
visibility and cannot be listed or followed easily.

I've created a setup to improve this and allow developers to easily
communicate about any kind of network event worth mentionning. Code,
screenshot, live demo, instructions and details are in the pull request :
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org/pull/194

Any comment is welcome. And since it is ultimately a tool for
developers, only you can define if it makes sense to merge it. Or if you
would like it to be done differently.

Best,

Sa?vann
