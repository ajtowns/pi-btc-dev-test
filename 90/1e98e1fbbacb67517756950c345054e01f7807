This proposal seems closer to Version 5 than Version 4, in spirit.
But given that useful content may be deduced from UUID, it is not
truly applicable to either.  A bitcoin-specific version 6, if you
will.

Note that, as this example unintentionally implies, humans are going
to want a side-by-side mapping /anyway/, just to make it readable and
usable to humans.

Almost all useful multi-chain software will require a readable
shortname string anyway, the thing this proposal wishes to avoid.
