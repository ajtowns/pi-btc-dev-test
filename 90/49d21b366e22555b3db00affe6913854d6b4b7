This is a good point. The rollout procedure needs to be fully tested
*before* any changes are enforced.

Has anyone provided conclusive results on system load demands with an
increase to 2MB? Extrapolating further to higher blocksizes will also be
useful to get an idea of the scope of the problem. If the system does jump
to 2MB it is unlikely that will be the ultimate limit so 4, 8, 16 etc...
should also be quantified.

We already hear of the high system load (energy/cost) requirements* for
nodes under the current blocksize which appears to have created a barrier
to entry for a lot of miners. If increasing to 2MB makes it even more
expensive in terms of hardware and energy costs to run a node that will
consolidate the nodes into the control of a few wealthy parties who can
afford to run the most powerful hardware. Conversely if the increase helps
the system and individual nodes run more efficiently then that would be a
big incentive for miners to upgrade.
