I think that is a misdirection on your part. The point of replace-by-fee is
to make 0-confirms reliably unreliable. Currently people can "get away"
with 0-confirms but it's only because most people arent actively double
spending, and when they do it is for higher value targets. Double spend
attacks *are* happening a lot more frequently than is being admitted here,
according to Peter from work with various clients.

Like single address reuse, people have gotten used to something which is
bad. Generally accepting 0-conf is also a bad idea(tm) and instant
confirmation solutions should be sought elsewhere. There are already
interesting solutions and concepts: greenaddress for example, and
CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY micropayment channels for example. Rather than
supporting and promoting risky 0-confirms, we need to spend time on better
alternative solutions that will work for everyone and not during the
honeymoon phase where attackers are fewer.
