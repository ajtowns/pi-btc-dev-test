I somewhat agree with Will (but also with Mike, Jeff, and Charlie.) I
think the idea of letting consumers know advanced details about the
transaction is good and defining these with strong types is also good.
Maybe an arbitrary set of accounting line items would be more
palatable. You could have a line item for state sales tax for example,
or a cash back reward, or a merchant discount like the proposed,
whatever is applicable. It would be a list of amount / label tuples
maybe.
