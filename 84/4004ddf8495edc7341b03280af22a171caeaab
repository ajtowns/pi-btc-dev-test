This sounds very dangerous. As Gregory Maxwell pointed out, the key derivation
function is weak enough that passphrases could be easily brute forced, at which
point the bad guys have cryptographic proof that you tried to lie to them and
cover up funds.


What model of human memory are you assuming here? What specifically are you
assuming is easy to remember, and hard to remember? What psychology research
backs up your assumptions?
