I only meant that double spends minutes apart are possible and that by then 
the sole use of a monitor is too late even if it will tell you.

Fair enough.

millisecond counts and you probably don't want to rely on watching 
transactions propagate across the block chain. For inter-exchange traffic 
this BIP would probably be useful. I've been talking about the consumer 
case.

That's quite different, granted.

> No, I expect there to be many kinds of trades where dispute mediation is 
unnecessary, e.g. when I buy a drink at Starbucks or a burger at McDonalds 
the chances of me wanting to charge it back is basically zero. Same for 
sending between people who know each other, large corporate transactions 
where the threat of a lawsuit is more useful than mediation, etc.

I wouldn't assume that if bitcoin alone (i.e. without third parties) can't 
be used for medium-high value purchases then it's useless. 

> But for transactions where third parties are needed for dispute mediation, 
yes, I'd expect there to be a handful of well known trusted names for the 
majority of such transactions, and then a long tail of specialists who only 
mediate e.g. purchases of rare Aztec artifacts or other things where a 
generic company might be easily fooled.

Agreed.
