I think this is just a terminology confusion.
There's conflicting spends of the same outputs (aka unconfirmed
double-spends), and there's signature malleability which Segregated
Witnesses solves.
If we want to define malleability as signature malleability +
conflicting spends, then that's fine.
But it seems Christian is mostly interested in signature malleability,
which is what SW can solve.
In fact, creating conflicting spends is sometimes useful for some
contracts (ie to cancel the contract when that's supposed to be
allowed).
Maybe it is "incorrect" that people use "malleability" when they're
specifically talking about "signature malleability", but I think that
in this case it's clear that we're talking about transactions having
an id that cannot be changed just by signing with a different nonce
(what SW provides).

Please, Christian, correct me if you mean something else.
