This is something I've wanted since 2011, but hasn't been a priority.

I'm not sure this increases the priority of it.

If someone feels it's worth the time, I'd suggest coding up a branch that 
hardforks it in at some far-off block height. Even if it doesn't get merged 
right away, at least the code will be available for testing and ready to go 
when/if that time comes.
