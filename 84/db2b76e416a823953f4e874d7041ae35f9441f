I agree with matejcik?s point 1 to 3 and especially with point 4.
The mandatory flag (or optional-flag) makes much sense to me.

I don?t see any reasons why space would be an issue.

HWWs probably can?t handle PBST natively since it is not optimised for
presenting various informations in a signing-verification.

A single stream-in of a PSBT through USB (or similar channel) will not work in
many cases since HWW come often with very restrictive RAM constraints.

Furthermore, I forget to mention in my last mail, that registering (or defining)
a mime-type for PSBT would probably a great usability feature.
(Send PSBT by email/messanger and with dbl-click to open feature, etc.)
