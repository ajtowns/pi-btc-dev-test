I read from your answer that even if we use ECDHE, we can't use it for
every situation. So in any case we need the simple bootstrap via a
session key parameter. My suggestion is defer ECDHE for now but keep it
in mind. We can add it later I think.

I happily step up and do the implementation work on the app side. A
first step could be:

- If there is an "s" parameter present wrap the Bluetooth connections
with AES. Sounds good?
