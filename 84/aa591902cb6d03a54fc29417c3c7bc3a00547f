Thanks for CC'ing me Mike. Having trouble receiving maillist list posts.

Even if a user could get the BIP70 URL in the URI, they would still need
internet to access the URL. This BLE spec doesn't preclude BIP70, but can
work with it while still allowing individuals without a certificate to
broadcast a request.

The issue of confused payments becomes less so if the Recipient broadcasts
a name along with the 10 digit public addr prefix. Only if there is a name
conflict will the user have to be concerned with the prefix. The name can
be something like

Mikes Coffee #1 and it can have a "Register #1" at the counter. A customer
facing screen can also show the 10 digit prefix.
