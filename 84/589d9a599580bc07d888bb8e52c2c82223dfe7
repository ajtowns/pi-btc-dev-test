Yes - the logic applies to all soft forks.  Each soft fork degrades the
security of non-upgraded nodes.

The core design of bitcoin is that trustless nodes validate the work of
miners, not trust them.

Soft forks move in the opposite direction.  Each new soft-forked feature
leans very heavily on miner trust rather than P2P network validation.
