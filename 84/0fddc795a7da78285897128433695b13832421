Have you talked with anybody at the Bitcoin Foundation about this proposal?

As Chief Scientist of the Foundation, I am strongly opposed to any proposal
that puts the Foundation in a position of centralized authority, so this is
unacceptable: "The Bitcoin Foundation will act as fair play party and
enforcement body to control the misuse of vast financial powers which
bitcoin has."

The idea that a central organization can be trusted to keep secrets secure
is just fundamentally wrong. In the very recent past we have seen
government organizations fail in that task (the NSA, the OPM) and we see
commercial organizations that SHOULD be highly motivated to do a good job
also fail (e.g. the Ashley Madison leak).

Even if it were technically possible, I would be opposed because
decentralization is a bedrock principle of Bitcoin.
