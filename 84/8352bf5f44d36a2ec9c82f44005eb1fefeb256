- Payment channels seem clearly inappropriate for things like monthly
subscriptions, the use of nlocktime, etc.

- Merchants cannot send requests to users for future payments, because
users don't run servers that they can connect to.  That's why BIP0070 works
the way it does.

- Need to have an interval for subscriptions, at a minimum, and stored in
the wallet so next months payment can go out on time

- Support for varying currency conversion needs to be baked in to
wallets.   Fortunately, by adding advisory subscription info to the
paymentrequest, this is left up to the wallet to
secure/validate/repeat/convert/etc. as needed for each subscription.

- The UI you describe is nice - but not unique to the solution.
