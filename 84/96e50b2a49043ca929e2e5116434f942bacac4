Hello Folks,

Thanks for expediting this debate, I understand some still disagree about how this final spec should look like.

1. Coldcard's plugin for Electrum using the original BIP spec is ready, https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/pull/4470 <https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/pull/4470>
2. Our hardware is ready with this spec (src will be public soon)
3. Samourai Wallet and Sentinel also are ready with the current spec.

We intend to upgrade it once the final spec is ready, but I need to ship Coldcard.

Cheers,

?.

At the moment a parser reading a key-value record does not know whether it should read it as per-input type or per-output, a way to address this is to declare in advance the number of maps and ensure they are ordered (inputs first). If you haven't already worked out some types for that i propose using:

By excessive I mean that even in the best case scenario (using the smallest possible scriptPubKey as in P2WPKH) it is possible to create a PSBT that would certainly create an invalid transaction (because of its size) when finalized. I haven't found anything related to this in the previous discussions, please ignore this if it was already proposed/discussed.
