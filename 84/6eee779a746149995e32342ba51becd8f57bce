My full-RBF patched branch of Bitcoin Core v0.14.0rc1 is now available:
https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/replace-by-fee-v0.14.0rc1

As with replace-by-fee-v0.13.2, this version uses the nRelevantServices
machinery to do preferential peering, so it's just a few lines of code changed
between it and Bitcoin Core v0.14.0rc1.

The relevant services machinery is less agressive at connecting to full-RBF
peers than the earlier custom code previous versions used. But it seems to work
well enough to keep RBF peers connected to each other, so I'm inclined to keep
using it as doing so makes maintaining this patched branch pretty trivial every
time a new upstream version is released.
