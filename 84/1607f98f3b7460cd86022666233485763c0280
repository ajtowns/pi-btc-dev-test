Issues like that particular one (simple elegant fix, strong utility
justification) plus previously more privacy stuff (like committed tx,
homomorphic encrypted values) was what got me wondering about a way to
do a live beta (one-way peg) and then to get excited about the 2wp &
Greg's mechanism for that.

I think it would be hypothetically possible to make a "special"
singleton sidechain which is merge mined, and has a consensus rule to
require some proportion of reward be sent to it via coinbase tx (a
mechanism to address incentive incompatibility) and a general timeline
eg 12mo to next version +/- etc. might be an interesting thing to
explore as a place to store live versions of "hard fork wishlist"
items where people who need them early can help validate them.

I am not sure that helps the full network upgrade issue though.
