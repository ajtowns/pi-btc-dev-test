Can you show me a model of quantum computation that is conjectured to
be able to solve the discrete log problem but which would take longer
than fractions of a second to do so? Quantum computation has to occur
within the coherence lifetime of the system.

By using scriptpubkeys with actual security against quantum computers
instead of snake-oil.

Indeed, that doesn't work.

They are. But I don't believe that is relevant; the attacker would
simply steal the coins on spend.
