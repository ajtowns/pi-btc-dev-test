Please fix your software stack. Something is wrong with your system
and I doubt it has much to do with bitcoin. A full sync here takes
something like an hour.

There are certainly lots of scalability things going on, but there is
no cause for concern for regular hardware being unable to _keep up_
without a hardforking change to the protocol first.
