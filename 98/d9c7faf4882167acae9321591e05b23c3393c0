Basically stealth addresses *are* your scheme, using the blockchain as a
low or even no overhead communication channel for the payor to give the
payee that multiplier without bidirectional communication.

In the business card example I can't easily take your business card and
just send you some money without that transaction being linked to public
information. (your business card)

WoT is a perfect example of the problem: if you put BIP32 branch payment
info into my OpenPGP key I can't pay you securely and reliably without
making the transaction public. The best I can do is pick a nonce and pay
X=rootKey*nonce, communicating to you the nonce later - this isn't
reliable because if I or you lose the nonce the funds are lost.

With stealth addresses the user experience can be as simple as you
telling me on the phone "hey! send me that 0.234 BTC you owe me!", me
clicking on "Send to Alan Reiner (verified by PGP)" (perhaps again on my
off-line second factor device for a multi-sig wallet) and tellling you
"OK, sent".

Even if your phone has been wiretapped, the attacker still didn't learn
exactly what transaction was actually used to make the payment - a big
advantage over per-tx nonce stuff.
