This is outright ridiculous.

Zero-confirmation double-spending is a small problem, and possible
solutions are known. (E.g. trusted third party + multi-sig addresses for
small-value transactions.)

On the other hand, protocol changes like described above might have
game-theoretical implications which are non-trivial and hard to understand.

The above approach works as long as the majority of hashpower is honest,

No. Bitcoin should work if miners are merely individually rational, i.e.
they try to maximize their pay-offs without colluding with others.

I guess word "honest" might have different meanings, that can be a source
of confusing.
1. Honest -- not trying to destroy bitcoin
2. Honest -- following rules which are not required by the protocol
