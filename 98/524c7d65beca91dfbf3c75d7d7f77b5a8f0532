True; the effort of a chargeback is non-zero on credit cards; but that's my 
point: it's non-zero for bitcoin too.

You're still being unfair to bitcoin.  Not everyone who uses bitcoins will 
be dishonest.  The dishonest 5% hashing power is not going to be used in 
100% of any given merchants transactions.  That's all I'm saying.  You're 
original statement that we could end up in a position that bitcoin has a 
higher failure rate than credit cards seems unfair to me.

who were systematically trying to defraud merchants, we'd already be having 
worse security than magstripe credit cards.

"[If] there was a large enough population" -- why are bitcoin users more 
dishonest than credit card users?  Most people are honest, so it seems 
unlikely that that 5% attack surface would be used at 100%; or even 40% 
necessary to equal the 2% chargeback rate with CC.  

I really didn't want to get into an argument over this: all I'm saying is 
that things aren't as bad as you painted them.
