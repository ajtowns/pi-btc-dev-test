Bypassing IsStandard should be considered as an "expert mode". The 
message should be "don't bypass it unless you understand what you are 
doing".

By the way, miners are PAID to protect the network. It is their greatest 
responsibility to follow the development and keep their software up to 
date.

Let me try to answer this question. Softfork is beneficial to non-mining 
full nodes as they will follow the majority chain. In the case of a 
hardfork (e.g. BIP101), non-upgrading full nodes will insist to follow 
the minority chain. (unless you believe that all non-miner should use an 
SPV client)

Put it in a different angle. In a softfork, the new fork is a persistent 
95% attack against the old fork, which will force all in-cooperating 
miners to join (or leave). In a hardfork, however, there is no mechanism 
to stop the old fork and we may have 2 chains co-exist for a long time.

Although it is not mentioned in the whitepaper, the ability to softfork 
is a feature of Bitcoin. Otherwise, we won't have these OP_NOPs and the 
original OP_RETURN.
