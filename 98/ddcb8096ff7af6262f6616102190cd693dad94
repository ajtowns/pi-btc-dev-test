Share rate is relevant to more than user information - it also affects the 
variance of reward/payout. I disagree with claiming shares are found when 
they're not sent to the pool - this makes auditing and troubleshooting more 
difficult; for example, see the GUIMiner bug where it reports shares despite 
misinterpreting the pool's target and submitting nothing at all (this happens 
when the pool uses pdiff 1).

I don't understand the first two questions here at all.
