Rather than offering discounts, how about offering automatic cashback?
I know they're kinda stupid, but I gather cashback deals are very
commonplace in the US and (probably as a result) not unheard of elsewhere.

So you add an optional cashback_to field to the Payment message,
distinct from but conceptually similar to the refund_to field.  The
wallet can tally up how much cashback is received, without having to
trust the merchants.

Much harder to game, AFAICS.
