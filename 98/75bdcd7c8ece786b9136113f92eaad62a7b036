Clarification...

These are not mutually exclusive.  We can design an increase to blocksize
that increases available space on chain AND follow technological
evolution.  Peter's latest proposal is way too conservative on that front.

And given Peter's assertion that demand is infinite there will still be a
an ocean of off chain transactions for the likes of blockstream to address.
