Here is what I understand:

2^128 iterations is not brute forcable today, and will not be for the 
foreseeable future.

An EC pubkey of length n can be forced in approximately 2^(n/2) 
iterations (see http://ecc-challenge.info/) Thus, Bitcoin pubkeys, which 
are 256 bits, would require 2^128 iterations. This is why unused 
addresses (160 bits hash) are better protected than already used ones.

However, people tend to believe that a public key of size n requires 2^n 
iterations. This belief might have been spread by this popular image:
