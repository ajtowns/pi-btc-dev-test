I haven't looked closely at replace-by-fee yet, but I assume this is a
non-consensus change to mempool mechanics. To me, this seems like the
"actuator" side of fee mechanics: it provides a transaction sender a way to
influence the system.  By contrast, learning about fees is the "sensor"
side of fee mechanics.

Consider how a replace-by-fee wallet makes fee decisions. When does it
replace by fee?  It needs feedback in one of two forms:

a. Direct feedback from a trnasaction relay service, or:

b. Information in the blockchain, which is verified by all verifying nodes
and refined by all miners.

The first kind of information is quite acceptable and practical for many
use cases, but leave the wallet vulnerable to fabrications by that service.
This vulnerability is precisely what SPV security intends to mitigate,
right?

With only information type a, a (non-SPV) wallet can "shop around" to find
competing services, and this should work pretty well, provided the wallet
can discover those competing services. If, OTOH, the wallet has access to
information type b, it now has "perfect competition" across all such
services, even when it can't discover the low-priced services directly.

This actual-fees-in-the-actual-block-chain information of type b seem like
a powerful source of pricing information, and if SPV security is already
valuable for other reasons, then it seems natural to leverage that value.
