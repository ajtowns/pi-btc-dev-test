Hi all,

StackOverflow has something that they call "Free Vote-Based
Advertising for Open Source Projects". The way it works is that a
suggested 220x250 pixel ad is posted here:
http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/114442/open-source-advertising-sidebar-1h-2012.
As soon as it gets 6 upvotes or more it will be included in a rotation
of ads displayed on the right hand side of the StackOverflow site.

"It must be an advertisement soliciting the participation and
contribution of programmers writing actual source code. This is not
intended as a general purpose ad for consumer products which just
happen to be open source. It's for finding programmers who will help
contribute code or other programmery things (documentation, code
review, bug fixes, etc.)."

I remember Gavin talking about the need for testers (I don't know what
the need is for developers). Anyway, we could target the ad towards
whatever we need. If you think that this is a good idea, please post
some ad suggestions in this thread. Please don't post the suggestion
on StackOverflow just yet since we're not allowed to have multiple ads
for the same project and we'll want to make that ad a good one.

D.H.
