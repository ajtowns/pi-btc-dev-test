If the primary purpose of pow is to destroy value, then a masked proof of
burn to an expanded address that assigns the private key holder the right
to mine only in the next Nth block would be sufficient.  Expanding the
address space so that addresses can only be proven invalid only with the
private key.  Miners can then not trivially game the system by excluding
tx...without killing the entire system.  ( Like POW ... miners lose many
burns since only one valid proof is deterministically selected. Difficult
adjusted upward based on the number of valid proofs per block.)

The other part of "real POW" is that miners take *time* to mine.  Proof of
destroyed value us not sufficient.  Proof of time spent is critical....
something even a masked burn cannot provide.
