Hi Cameron, good to hear from you!

This is not really the case with Bitcoin. A MITM attack does not require that the attacker find a way to inject traffic into the communication between nodes. Peers will connect to the attacker directly, or accept connections directly from it. Such attacks can be easier than even passive attacks.

It is the implication of widespread authentication that is at issue. Clearly there are ways to implement it using a secure side channels.
