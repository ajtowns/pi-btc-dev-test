Yes, 3 years is silly.  But coin expiration and quantum resistance is
something I've been thinking about for a while, so I tried to steer the
conversation away from stealing old money for no reason ;).   Plus I like
the idea of making Bitcoin "2000 year proof".

- I cannot imagine either SHA256 or any of our existing wallet formats
surviving 200 years, if we expect both moores law and quantum computing to
be a thing.   I would expect the PoW to be rendered obsolete before the
Bitcoin addresses.

 - A PoW change using Keccak and a flexible number of bits can be designed
as a "future hard fork".  That is:  the existing POW can be automatically
rendered obsolete... but only in the event that difficulty rises to the
level of obsolescence.   Then the code for a new algorithm with a flexible
number of bits and a difficulty that can scale for thousands of years can
then automatically kick in.

 - A new addresses format and signing protocols that use a flexible number
of bits can be introduced.   The maximum number of supported bits can be
configurable, and trivially changed.   These can be made immediately
available but completely optional.

 - The POW difficulty can be used to inform the expiration of any addresses
that can be compromised within 5 years assuming this power was somehow used
to compromise them.   Some mechanism for translating global hashpower to
brute force attack power can be researched, and consesrvative estimates
made.   Right now, it's like "heat death of the universe" amount of time to
crack with every machine on the planet.   But hey... things change and 2000
years is a long time.   This information can be used to inform the
expiration and reclamation of old, compromised public addresses.

- Planning a hard fork 100 to 1000 years out is a fun exercise
