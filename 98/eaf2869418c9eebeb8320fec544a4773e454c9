I wish to NOT signal for segwit if mining.

I wish to NOT enforce segwit consensus rules.

good point, thanks for clarifying.

I've set the nTimeout to 0 already.  I will look into the NODE_WITNESS
p2p bit.

I think that logically, if coded correctly, my node would have no more
risks than any other legacy (pre-segwit) node on the network...

fair enough.  But these are the same risks as running any pre-segwit
node, correct?    For example bitcoin-core 0.13.0, or any version of
btcd to date...
