As the author of that comment: the reference there is unrelated to the
code but just a found-on-the-internet explanation for an trivial, old,
and well known technique (which I've seen in code since at least the
80s) that manages to sometimes surprise people who aren't familiar
with fixed point signal processing.  I wrote and submitted the comment
after encountering people confused by our code in another project,
long after it was written.
