Rather than a simple one-period delay, should there be a one-period 
"burn-in" to show sustained support of the threshold?  During this 
period, support must continuously remain above the threshold.  Any lapse 
resets to inactivated state.

With a simple delay, you can have the embarrassing situation where 
support falls off during the delay period and there is far below 
threshold support just moments prior to enforcement, but enforcement 
happens anyway.

BIP 101 has this problem too.
