BIP 9 doesn't limit itself, merely acknowledges the *inherent* nature of it 
not being applicable to hardforks. BIP 9 provides a mechanism for having 
miners coordinate softforks because they can make the upgrade process smoother 
this way. But the same is not true of hardforks: miners are essentially 
irrelevant to them, and cannot make the process any smoother. Therefore, BIP 9 
and any miner signalling in general is not very useful for deploying these.

Softforks are not required to use BIP 9, and even if they do, they are not 
required to use the recommended thresholds.

Basically, the problems you're trying to solve don't exist...
