I've been a strong supporter of the 1e-6 unit switch since the beginning
and ready to do whatever I can with Armory to help ease that
transition.  I'm happy to prioritize a release that updates the Armory
interface to make "bits" the default unit, when the time is right.  I
think it makes sense to get as many apps and services to upgrade nearly
simultaneously.

My plan is to have a popup on the first load of the new version that
briefly introduces the change, and mentions that they can go back to the
old way in the settings, but make them work to do it.  For the transient
period (6 months?) all input boxes will auto-update nearby labels with
the converted-to-BTC value as they type, so that they don't have to do
any math in their head.  Similarly, all displayed BTC values will show
both.  But the 1e-6 unit will always be default or first unless they
explicitly change it in the interface.
