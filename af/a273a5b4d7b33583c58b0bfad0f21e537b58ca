Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Scaling Bitcoin - summarizing non-jgarzik block size
	BIPs
Message-ID: <CADm_WcYva+CeM2eozBp_iDW6FZP_qCOu0ghVOzE4VzonPi_25w@mail.gmail.com>

To collect things into one place, I was asked by Kanzure to cover
non-jgarzik block size BIPs in a quick summary, and the Scaling Bitcoin
conf folks have graciously allocated a bit of extra time for this.

e.g. BIP 100.5, 103, 105, 106 - "the serious ones"

If there is some input people would like to add to the meat grinder prior
to Dec 7, email jeff at bloq.com

Thanks!
