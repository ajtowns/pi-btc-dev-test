Hi everyone,

Thanks to everyone for a very friendly and scientifically-oriented
discussion. We have collated all the issues that have been raised related
to NG, and placed them in context, here:
    http://hackingdistributed.com/2015/11/09/bitcoin-ng-followup/

Overall, NG has a unique insight: turning the block creation process upside
down can provide many benefits. Most notably, throughput can go as high as
the network will allow, providing scalability benefits that increase as the
network improves. There are many other side benefits, including fast
confirmations that are stronger than 0-conf in Core, and come much more
quickly than Core's 1-confirmations. And there are ancillary benefits as
well, such as resilience to fluctuations in mining power, and healthier
incentives for participants to ferry transactions. We believe that a fresh
new permission-less blockchain protocol, designed today, would end up
looking more like NG than Core. Of course, if NG could possibly be layered
on top of Bitcoin, that would be the ultimate combination.

Many thanks for an interesting discussion, and as always, we're happy to
hear constructive suggestions and feedback,
- egs
