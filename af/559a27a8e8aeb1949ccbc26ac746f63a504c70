Hey Matias,

We are working on bitcore-wallet-server (BWS), a HD multisig wallet

Could you describe what exactly BWS does? It sounds like the server doesn't
have to actually derive the keys itself for any particular purpose beyond
knowing the addresses are a part of the wallet. Could the server work if it
didn't even know that, and was just a bucket of arbitrary addresses with
the clients themselves deriving the addresses?
