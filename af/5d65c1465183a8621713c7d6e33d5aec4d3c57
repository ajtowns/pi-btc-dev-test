I have not seen a custodial service that does so (this is not a scientific study; I rarely use custodial services); custodial services will deduct more from your balance than what you send, but will not modify what you send, and will prevent you from sending more than your balance minus the fees they charge for sending onchain.

If the users are expected to manually operate a hardware wallet to fund the channel, they might do stupid things like using 2 wallets to make 2 txs, thinking that they could combine the values this way; or ?refilling? the offchain wallet with the address, as you suggested. While I appreciate the goal to separate the coin-selecting wallet with the offchain wallet, I am not sure if we should rely on users to do critical steps like entering the right value or not reusing the address. Especially, the setup address should be hidden from user?s view, so only a very few ?intelligent advanced users" could try to refill the channel.

If we don?t rely on the user as the bridge between the hardware wallet and the offchain wallet, we need a communication protocol between them. With such protocol, there is no need to spend the setup TXO with NOINPUT.
