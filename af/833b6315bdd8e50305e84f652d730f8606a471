Probably - but that's a very rare edge case. People that are security
conscious enough to buy a Trezor will not run XP. Also I don't dare to say
that there is not some way to sociaal-engineer the user with malware on a
compromised OS even with a trezor.

Maybe: for 0.9.2 add a warning message and push people to upgrade (either
to Win8.1 or something else), then in the next major release 0.10.0 drop XP
support completely.
