Individually rational strategy is to vote for coinbase reallocation on

Yes, in that case nobody will get reward. It is similar to prisoner's

In practice that would mean that simple game-theoretic models are no longer
applicable, as they lead to absurd results.

It absolutely doesn't matter whether they are deliberately trying to
double-spend or not: they won't be able to double-spend without a collusion.
