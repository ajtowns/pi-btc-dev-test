A planned hardfork, similar to certain softforks, leaves users with some
reduction in security.  It does not leave them defenseless.  Consider the
following:

1: Hard to be robbed on the basis of hashpower.

In reality the old chain will see mining all but stop, and blocks would be
hours to days apart even if a couple percentage points of hashpower failed
to switch over.  Six confirmations would certainly take days.  If the fork
can be scheduled at the beginning of a difficulty period, the old chain
would almost certainly not even ever make it to the next retargeting.

2: Hard to be robber on the basis of awareness.

Expect there to be fairly widespread coverage in the Bitcoin press, and as
the fork draws near, maybe coverage in business and tech publications.
Further, the alert keys will certainly be used, so node operators will get
the message directly.

3: There still needs to be a targeted attack by a fraudster on an unaware
node operator.

To fall victim, one needs to give up something of value to an attacker in
exchange for Bitcoins (on the old chain).  The typical uninitiated
full-node user (probably a small subset anyway) is typically going to be
buying bitcoin from a trusted source, and then saving or spending them, or
perhaps gambling.  They are not, typically, going to be providing a service
or selling goods in exchange for Bitcoin unless they are at least somewhat
aware of what is going on in the Bitcoin space.  It's possible, of course,
but we are talking about small numbers here of people who fit the above.

All three parts of the above would have to go perfectly wrong for someone
to loose out.  Someone somewhere will probably get scammed as a result of a
hardfork.  That stinks, and we should make reasonable efforts to help them
avoid that fate.  But at this point in Bitcoin's development, it is still
in beta, it's still an economic experiment, and we can't allow the software
to become hamstrung out of fear that some inattentive user might bungle
their security.  If they merely waited for 6 confirmations, as is the
standard advice, they would be waiting for days.  If that along doesn't
give them a hint that something is wrong, it might still be too early days
for them to be playing with Bitcoin for anything important.

I support a hardfork deployment that takes 80% of hashpower activate + a
4-month delay.
