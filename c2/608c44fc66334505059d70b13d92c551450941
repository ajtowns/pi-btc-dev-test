btw the fact that mining is (or can be) anonymous also makes oligopoly
or cartel behaviour likely unstable.  Miners can break ranks and
process transactions others wish to block, or with lower fees than a
cartel would like to charge, without detection.

Anonymous mining is a feature and helps ensure policy neutrality.

This is all overlaid by the 51% attack - if a coherent cartel arose
that could maintain 51% and had enough mutual self-interest to make
that stable, they could attack miners bypassing their cartel policies,
by orphaning their blocks.  This is partly why mining decentralisation
is important.  Also that is an overt act which is very detectable and
could lead to technical counter-measures by the users, who are in
ultimately in control of the protocol.  So there is some game theory
suggesting it would be inadvisable for miners to be overt in cartel
attacks.  Non overt attacks cant prevent anonymous under cutting of
cartel desired fee minimums.
