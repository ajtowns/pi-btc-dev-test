Subject: [Bitcoin-development] DOS-Attacks on bitcoin-client?
Message-ID: <51618612.9010603@olivere.de>

Hello,

I'm using your bitcoin-qt client (version 0.8.1). Normally everything is 
working pretty fine, but sometimes it seems that other nodes produce an 
enormous amount of traffic. I have not had the time to investigate 
thoroughly yet. I only have briefly viewed with tshark.

So far I have just restarted the client in the hope that it no longer 
connects with the 'evil' node. This usually works quite well.

Is anything about DOS-Attacks known to you?

regards
Oliver
