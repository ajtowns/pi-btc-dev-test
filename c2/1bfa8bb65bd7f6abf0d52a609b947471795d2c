I agree.  For example, a corporate wallet can require threshold signatures
to disburse.  Or for personal use you can have a couple of additional
keys, one stored on a secure device for confirmation and one offline as
emergency backup if you lose your secure device.

For context - I am the author of the latter.

Incompatible at the UI level, but not at the block chain level.  Changing
the block chain rules will be quite an undertaking.  You will have to set
a block number for the rule change a few months in advance and will have
to get agreement from the pools.  I think it is important to increase
trust in the bitcoin ecosystem sooner than that.  The current flat
exchange rate and difficulty may be a signal that people are getting risk
averse.

That is my worry too.  We already have working code for this (pull 319),
and the addresses are not so long as to be unusable.  I hope we can move
forward on the existing code and in parallel move forward on block chain
rule proposals at an agreed upon block number.
