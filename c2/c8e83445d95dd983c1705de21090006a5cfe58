There is some postprocessing done in the script that fetches
translation files (see
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/devtools/update-translations.py
). It removes stray control characters, but for example there is no
check for number and presence of formatting characters. I generally
check that by manually looking through the diffs. But would be great
if someone added that.
