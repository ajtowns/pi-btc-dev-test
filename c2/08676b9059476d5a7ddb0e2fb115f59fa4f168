In my opinion, there's not necessary any payload format (json, xml,
multipart). In keeping stuff KISS, everything we need is just an address in
response + potentially some stuff like HTTP redirects (for providing
additional compatibility for proposal of bitcoin URIs with "amount",
"label" and other parts). I don't see reason why we need some extra payload
yet.
