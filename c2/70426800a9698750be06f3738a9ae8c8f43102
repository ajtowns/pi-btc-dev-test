It does have another advantage: it makes testnet codes visually (after base58
encoding) different from realnet ones, which is probably the reason why the
relatively large number 111 was chosen.

The only small change that can cause the first base58 character to remain equal,
is a modification to nVersion of less than 5 in absolute value.

PS: +/- 111 is also possible, instead of XOR 111.
