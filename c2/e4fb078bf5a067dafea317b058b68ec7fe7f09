Thinking about this a bit, I support this proposal for a BIP.
This is not Bitcoin, but address types are bound to meet in meat-space and 
it would be good to have a central place where this is defined.

I would very much appreciate someone that worked on BIP32/BIP43 itself to 
comment on the details.

Quoting bip 43;


"We encourage different schemes to apply for assigning a separate BIP
number and use the same number for purpose field, so addresses won't be
generated from overlapping BIP32 spaces."
