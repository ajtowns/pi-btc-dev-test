I'd add a third: make structured key-management possible, e.g.

At a minimum:  Users should be able to hit a "retire keys / keys
possibly compromised" button, which creates a new seed, forces the
user to make a backup (and allows more than one), then switches to the
new seed and moves all their coins.

"We didn't say it couldn't be done?  We said don't do it!"

Part of the challenge here is that the service does a number of things
people _really_ shouldn't be doing? things so dangerous that I
certainly won't do them? and as a result to not use the site turn into
big education efforts rather than just "use this other thing (that
also does the wrong headed thing you want to do)".
