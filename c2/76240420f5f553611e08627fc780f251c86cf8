The BIP is a process for deriving only the type of scripts you would
encounter doing addmultisigaddress. More complicated scripts would
require more metadata to be shared, but the only case we describe is
when given public keys and the number of signatures required.

You're right, we're missing a Specification. I have tweaked the document
to cover this now.

It would be interesting, but I agree it should not be brought into these
validation rules - just a convention for people to follow for now. I
think it's fair that implementers are free to order them however they
please. But I think there is good reason for wallets to opt in to the
convention and declare this, for ease of recovery, and for
interoperability reasons.
