The Trsst project (Twitter + RSS + Google Reader = Trsst social network)
has some interesting ideas:

Quote:

   In Trsst, every user account is a digital wallet. Authors and
   individual pieces of content can receive secure and anonymous
   micro-payments of digital crypto-currency, enabling long-
   envisioned content monetization schemes where authors receive
   small payments each time their content is consumed, shared,
   or "liked".

But it seems that this could be a helpful way to at least _begin_ organizing Bitcoin around people and organizations in a way that is broadly familiar.

>> Re-orienting Bitcoin around people and companies is something we wanted to do for a long time. How do you get an address linked to a personal profile? Someone was asking me about this last month and I suggested watermarking addresses into social network profile pictures. The advantage of that approach is every social network supports profile pictures and big ones like Facebook and Twitter allow querying of somebodies picture without needing any API or user authentication, eg:

>> So obviously with such a thing you can send to any Facebook user who has configured their profile correctly. There's a library that implements watermarking that can survive social network recompression, but it is (doh) written in Java ;)
