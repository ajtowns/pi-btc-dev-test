This is quite off topic, so please consider another channel. As long as you
have my attention, I previously started a cryptographically secure RPS game
as a proof of concept.

https://github.com/thofmann/rock-paper-scissors-protocol-secure/blob/master/readme.md

Unfortunately, I do not have the time to develop it at the moment, but you
can message me off the channel if you would like to discuss things further.

Thank you,
Trevin Hofmann
