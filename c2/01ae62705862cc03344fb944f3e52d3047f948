I was looking at the wiki entry for this and noticed that your
description of DNSSEC is incorrect. It is an internet standard and is
widely deployed in the root (.), many TLDs, ccTLDs and second leverl
domains.

Also understand when the IETF or ICANN adopts new (we worked on DNSSEC
no less than 10 years) standard the horizon is at least 20 years.
Nothing and I really mean nothing is adopted in mass over shorter time
scales.

I also am largely in favor of using secured zones to publish TXT
records to digital currencies. I've been thinking mainly about TXT
using the following format for bitcoin.

_btc.<lhs>.<rhs>

you can look up the following record _btc.rick.wesson.us (from
rick at wesson.us) which yealds

; <<>> DiG 9.6-ESV-R4-P3 <<>> _btc.rick.wesson.us txt

while this isn't a secured zone, any leverage of DNSSEC would require
the application to have direct hooks into the stub-resolver, rather
than just leveraging the OS's implementation.

just some food for thought...
