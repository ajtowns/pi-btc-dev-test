I'm pleased to announce support for creating individual accounts on https://statoshi.info so that devs can create, save, and share their own dashboards. If you want to create an account for yourself, follow these instructions: https://medium.com/@lopp/statoshi-info-account-creation-guide-8033b745a5b7

If you're unfamiliar with Statoshi, check out these two posts:

My goal with Statoshi is to provide insight into the operations of Bitcoin Core nodes. If there are any metrics or instrumentation that you think should be added to Statoshi, please submit an issue or a pull request at https://github.com/jlopp/statoshi
