Specialization of nodes is ongoing most prominent with SPV wallets and mining.

There is a need I see on my own business for software that is able to serve multiple wallets, and is multi tiered,
so the world facing P2P node can be in a DMZ. I target them with a hybrid model that is SPV plus mempool transaction validation 
against UTXO and use ?reference? implementations as border router.  I think that this setup will be common for enterprises 
and hence push for a stripped down ?reference? border router without wallet, payment protocol, GUI, RPC calls here. 

That border router could also serve as archive node evtl. also offering blocks at bulk e.g. through http. 
Enterprises that run a multi tiered environment have the bandwith to serve as archives.
