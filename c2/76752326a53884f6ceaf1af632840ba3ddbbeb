No, the hardfork can still happen, but if a small group remains using the
old chain (a single person will likely abandon it very soon), then it
cannot be said that deployment was universal and thus the hardfork BIP
doesn't move to the final state. As long as there's users using the old
chain, a hardfork BIP shouldn't become final if I understood BIP2
correctly.

In other words,  uncontroversial hardfork bips can make it to the final
state once deployed, controversial hardforks may never become universally
deployed.
