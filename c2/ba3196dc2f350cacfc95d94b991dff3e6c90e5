First of all, sorry for the delayed answer.

Thank you, I knew this wasn't new for us but I doubted we had written
it anywhere.
As said in those mails, being only able to offer AAA for BTC and not
BTC for AAA nor AAA for BBB is enough of a limitation to justify a
hardfork IMO.

These are the two methods I know for cross-chain trading (no third
chain needed in any of them):

In fact, I don't think the seller will care enough about this to pay
the proof of publication fee either. Assuming sellers can either
broadcast the order on a bitmessage-like network or use your proof of
publication scheme, the later will be always be more expensive. So my
prediction is that most people will just use the simplest, fastest and
cheapest method, but I guess only time can tell.
I don't think this will be a tragedy, because like we discussed on
IRC, I don't think the primary goal of markets is price discovery, but
trade itself.

About historic data, the actual trades are always public, and some
kind of "archivers" could collect and maintain old orders for historic
bid and asks, etc.

As an aside, nLockTime would be nice not to always have to
double-spend the inputs of an order to cancel it.
