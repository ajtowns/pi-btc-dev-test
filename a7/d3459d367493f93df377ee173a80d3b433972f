Hi Sriram !

Thank you very much for your Reply !

Yes you are right.

I did not had the right Configuration Options.

BTC Drake and ChinaTinte contacted me yesterday direct off the Mailing 
List after i posted the mail here and helped me to solve the Problem.

I got bitcoin-core finally builded from sources and running.

Big Compliments to everyone especially also to all the bitcoin developers.

Have all a nice Day.
Greetings LinuXperia
