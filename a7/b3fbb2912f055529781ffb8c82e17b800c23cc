Martin,

I like your idea for the commit protocol in that it resolves the
vandalous address substitution attack. However, I don't see a way to
prevent privacy loss without adverse impact to the scenario.

Anyone could perform the handshake and thereby obtain the payment
request. Therefore to prevent inadvertent disclosure the customer must
visually confirm the "phrase" and then verbally tell the merchant to
proceed by sending the payment request.

One might argue that it's sufficient to preserve the integrity of the
transaction while suffering the privacy loss, especially given that a
hijacked handshake should never result in a completed transaction -
unless of course the hijacker pays.

But imagine someone purchasing their meds. HIPAA requires the checkout
queue to form behind a yellow line. That speaks directly to this question.
