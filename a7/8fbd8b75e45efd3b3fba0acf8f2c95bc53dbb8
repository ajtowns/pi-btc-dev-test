rewarded with fees and

form a shared valid history,
incentivising them to behave honestly.[...]"

Ignoring altrustic miners, the irreversibility of a DMMS chain
obviously depends on the rewards received by miners on that chain.
Nobody is claiming that sidechains will be "as secure bitcoin", any 2
way pegged assets is always "more secure" (probably too vague of a
term in this context) in its original chain.

Since all seigniorage from Bitcoin's initial distribution is spent on
mining subsidies for the main chain, it is not available to subsidize
sidechains too. Thus sidechains, in principle, reward their miners
with the same Bitcoin will use in the future: only transaction fees.
Since some people claim that won't be enough (is not always clear to
me if they believe that won't be enough for sidechains or also for
bitcoin when the subsidies are gone), we included this section with
other ideas we have explored to further. Some of them, like
"time-shifted fees" could be interesting for Bitcoin itself in the
future.

Reorganizations are both a naturally occurring phenomenon and
something that an attacker may cause to revert history.
Section "11. Calculations" of the Bitcoin whitepaper gives you this
formula (in C code):

#include <math.h>
double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)
{
    double p = 1.0 - q;
    double lambda = z * (q / p);
    double sum = 1.0;
    int i, k;
    for (k = 0; k <= z; k++)
    {
        double poisson = exp(-lambda);
        for (i = 1; i <= k; i++)
            poisson *= lambda / i;
        sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));
    }
    return sum;
}
Also says "Given our assumption that p > q, the probability drops
exponentially as the number of blocks the
attacker has to catch up with increases."

In this case, the contest period determines z, the number of blocks
the attacker has to catch up from the honest chain.
So the longer the contest period is, the harder it is to succeed with
a fraudulent transfer.
For example, if a given sidechain chooses 52560 as the contest period
(1 year assuming 10 min blocks), it will be very hard for an attacker
to produce a fake alternative longest-than-the-last-year-of-history
fork to steal coins.
A sidechain with such an extreme contest period would probably not be
very practical though, since honest users would have to wait more than
a year to complete transfers from the parent chain to the sidechain
and viceversa.

I hope this clarifies our assumptions.
