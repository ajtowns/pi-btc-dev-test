Jerry, some feedback on generating space-efficient QR codes. QR codes
have 4 possible encodings, see "Storage":
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code

The encoding you're proposing in BIP81 switches you to binary mode
without actually using all the bits. So you'll end up with bloaty QR
codes. One fix would be of course use all the available bits.

However, binary QR codes cannot be used to auto-dispatch to apps on
Android. If you want a wallet app to automatically open upon scan, you
need to encode your data as an URI. That pretty much locks you into
using alphanumeric mode QR codes.

I've implemented that in Bitcoin Wallet for efficiently encoding
transactions and BIP70 payment requests into QR codes. Since the allowed
alphabet is 43 chars, I've named the encoding Base43 (it uses the same
algorithm as Base58 or Base64). Tell me if you're interested in the details.
