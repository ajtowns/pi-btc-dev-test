First and foremost, I consider this thread an utter waste of time. These 
matters were "finished" over a year ago, and there is no need to dig them up 
again just because there are numbers for BIPs now. I don't intend to continue 
this topic any further than necessary, since my time (and everyone else's) is 
better spent working on *actual forward progress*, not this attempt to rewrite 
history. That being said...

Before the BIP process was formalized. The process itself existed long before.

It did. In early 2011, there was a consensus and multiple implementations (by 
name, I know of at least Spesmilo and WalletBuddy). This is by definition the 
Final status. It was not until months later that anyone objected to the 
standard.

You are contradicting the assignment of BIP 0020 to a preexisting standard 
here.

By trying to demote BIP 0020 from Final to Draft, you are not following the 
specification in BIP 0001.

Rather, I am claiming that assigning a number does not give you the authority 
to demote a preexisting standard. No other standards organization has 
attempted to claim preexisting standards don't exist or change their status.

Anyone is welcome to submit a new BIP aimed at Superceding BIP 20 (and doing 
so might make good sense soon, with various new functionality), but until that 
occurs, BIP 20 remains the Final status it has been for a whole year now.
