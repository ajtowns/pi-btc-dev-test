It's not about being technically correct. It is about protecting the
user from grave breaches of privacy. It is for their own benefit that
they should not be reusing addresses, and if they understood why they
wouldn't.

Unfortunately calling it a "bitcoin address" and including an "address
book" in the reference client has had the effect of making people
think that these objects are like paypal address, or email addresses,
but they are not and they should not be treated the same.
