I did that Sunday twice. I'll report the results soon. Short version is that it looks like valgrind is just finding 200 kB to 600 kB of pblocktemplate, which is declared as a static pointer. Not exactly the multi-GB leak I'm looking for, but possibly related.

I've also got two bitcoind processes running on the same machine that I started at the same time, running on different ports, all with the same settings, but one of which is serving getblocktemplate every 5-6 seconds and the other is not, while logging RSS on both every 6 seconds. RSS for the non-serving node is now 734 MB, and for the serving node 1997 MB. Graphs coming soon.

The improved reporting suggests that actual in-memory usage ("usage":) by CTxMemPool is about 2.5x to 3x higher than the serialized transaction sizes ("bytes":). The excess memory usage that I'm seeing is on the order of 100x higher than the mempool "bytes": value. As such, I think it's unlikely that this is the mempool, or at least not normal/correct mempool behavior.

I don't know which email list he is subscribed to (probably XT), so I'm sharing it with both lists to make sure you're all aware of how big an issue this can be.

I ran a Core bitcoind process (commit d78a880) overnight with no mining connected to it, and (IIRC -- my memory is fuzzy) when I woke up it was using around 400 MB of RSS and the mempool was at around "bytes":10MB, "usage": 25MB. I ran ./bitcoin-cli getblocktemplate once, and IIRC the RSS shot up to around 800 MB. I then ran getblocktemplate every 5 seconds for about 30 minutes, and RSS climbed to 1180 MB. An hour after that with more getblocktemplates, and now RSS is at 1350 MB. [Edit: 1490 MB about 30 minutes later.] getmempoolinfo is still showing "usage" around 25MB or less.
