Not necessarily some_averaging_function. Could also be something that
depends on how much work has been put in, i.e. make the miners do more
computational work if they want to add bigger blocks into the chain, and
the chain doesn't have to be the original chain, it could be a sidechain or
block extension, so as to not force people to upgrade.
