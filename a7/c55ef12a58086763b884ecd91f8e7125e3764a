Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Miners forced to run non-core code in order to
 get segwit activated
Message-ID: <09fd0e96-6a9f-4f6c-bd50-ecdb0af34868@email.android.com>

I concur with Mark's reply. Just to underscore this: Miners arent going to bother to signaling or changing a setting unless they have to. Anything that requires time--especially if requiring a restart/any time not mining or risks a crash---reduces income. So why would they change any settings unless they have to?

I think it is very na?ve to assume that any shift would be temporary.
We have a hard enough time getting miners to proactively upgrade to
recent versions of the reference bitcoin daemon. If miners interpret
the situation as being forced to run non-reference software in order
to prevent a chain split because a lack of support from Bitcoin Core,
that could be a one-way street.
