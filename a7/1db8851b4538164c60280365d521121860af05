Hi Gregory,

I played with the database sync as well to get further speedups, but in the latest version I could only get about 1% extra from this. 

In the Satoshi client there is a bunch of sleeps and mutexes (put in there with great generosity)  for making threads run smoother and to avoid deadlock I guess.

The big change in speed came from moving from the threading based setup to the async based setup, so I think these are the culprit. Further, as I also write somewhere in the wiki. I can measure that 50% of the time is consumed in verify, so there is not much left to optimize now. Actually, Berkeley DB does a quite decent job in caching reads so not even a cache should help.

Cheers,

M
