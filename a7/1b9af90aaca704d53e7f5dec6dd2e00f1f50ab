I want to put a big thank-you out to Pindar, Warren, and others in the
organizing committee who I know must have put in a lot of hours to make
this happen. I will be attending, and I hope to see many of you there too.
It is my sincere hope that the academic structure of a workshop will help
break down some of the communication walls that have arisen in this debate,
and help us all work towards finding a compromise towards scaling bitcoin,
something we all want to see happen.
