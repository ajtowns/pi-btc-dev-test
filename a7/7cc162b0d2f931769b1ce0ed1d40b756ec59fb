The point of the extended URI is to allow the server to negotiate payment 
details (payment/order information, fees, new privacy address, etc) rather 
than merely sending a simple payment to a single fixed address.

I am not convinced *aliases* are practical, without CA trust. An organization 
that wants to trust a CA with all their funds can leave off the address 
portion, to provide more human-friendly URIs.
