I'm working on a more digestable alternative:
https://gist.github.com/jgarzik/6065679

Should be ready in another ~24 hours, as its obviously incomplete
right now.  Alas the publishing of the lame version (which yes, I did
ACK) didn't give me time to finish my version.

I worked on Fedora packaging while at Red Hat, so hopefully, I have a
bit of insight here.  Was also thinking about publishing this on
opensource.com.
