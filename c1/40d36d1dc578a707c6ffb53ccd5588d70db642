Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Gitian builds on all platforms using
	Vagrant/VirtualBox (GH #1597)
Message-ID: <CACh7GpH4MbT7gG-p0OONvi=HfLwE8ud4e3m86Xdqkb-MEjz9XA@mail.gmail.com>

I had some difficulty setting up and maintaining my own gitian build
system. So in the time-honored tradition of scratching my own itch, I
recorded the necessary steps into a makefile so that doing a gitian build
is a simple as "cd contrib/vagrant && make", on any platform provided that
you have the necessary dependencies installed.

I hope that others find this useful. I have submitted these scripts as
pull-request #1597 on github.

Cheers,
Mark Friedenbach
