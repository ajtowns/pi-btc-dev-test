SSL doesn't actually provide non-repudiation. We actually want
non-repudiation. I want to be able to prove to others that some node
deceived me.

(there are a number of other arguments I could make against SSL, but
that one is probably sufficient? or rather, it's an argument that we
should have some way of cheaply getting non-reputable signatures
regardless of the transport)

Also look into torchat, which bundles a special tor build and runs a
hidden service.

Because of services like Blockchain.info attacking the casual privacy
users not using their webwallet service I've been thinking that even
for clients that don't normally use tor their own transaction
announcements should probably be made by bringing up a connection over
tor and announcing. But thats another matter...

I've switched to running on tor exclusively for my personal node (yay
dogfooding) and I've found it to connect and sync up very fast most of
the time. The biggest slowdown appears to be the our timeout on the
tor connections is very high and so if it gets unlucky on the first
couple attempts it can be minutes before it gets a connection. We're
short on onion peers and I sometimes get inbound connections before I
manage to get an outbound.
