I agree. Especially when multiple chains are combined (multisig) for
P2SH usage, defining things like a gap limit becomes impossible
without knowing some metadata.

However, perhaps it is possible to define something like "BIP44
import-compatible", meaning that the application doesn't actually
support all of BIP44 features, but does guarantee not losing any funds
when imported? Similar things could be done for other purpose types.
