Often these are groups of nodes that are in collaboration, so logically they are one node from a system security standpoint. But if people become generally reliant on good node registration, it will become the registrar who controls access to the network. So my concern rests I this proposal becoming widely adopted.

BIP151 is self-admittedly insufficient to protect against a MITM attack. It proposes node identity to close this hole (future BIP required). The yet-to-be-specified requirement for node identity is the basis of my primary concern. This is not self-authentication.

The orthogonal question of whether Tor is safe for use with the Bitcoin P2P protocol is a matter of existing research.
