Depends, without BIP62 a /lot/ of the even basic contracts that people
want to use today (or wanted to use 18 months ago) are unusable, in
fact, without BIP62, the atomic swaps suggested as important for
sidechains are not secure. While redoing Bitcoin in a hardfork is nice,
its a very long-term thing, so I'm not sure about making people wait for
a large hardfork just to use payment channels.

Also, I echo the difficulty of writing consensus-compatible code and
highly suggest anyone with money behind an implementation that is doing
script verification in code that isnt Bitcoin Core rethink that decision.
