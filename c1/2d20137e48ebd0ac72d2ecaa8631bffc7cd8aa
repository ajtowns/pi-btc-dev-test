Well that's good that there is no real problem.

To be brutally honest; I don't see how the BIP16/17 changes are any less 
"breaking" than what I proposed (I'm not trying to push mine; forget it, the 
last thing bitcoin needs is another proposal if there is no real argument).  
I will agree the changes are smaller for BIP16, since the transactions are 
left as they are.

If BIP16/BIP17 were being honest they would too increase the version number 
of the transaction structure.  The new transaction type is not supported by 
the old client... that's a break.  My argument would be that once you're 
going to break the old clients anyway, go the whole hog and fix some other 
stuff as well.

I'm glad I wasn't talking rubbish then.

Me too.  Which is a shame; as it means we're locked into quite a fair number 
of earlier decisions that will now never be changed.

Again: I don't see how BIP16/17 aren't "breaking" as well; but perhaps I'm 
just not familiar enough with the conventions.  As far as I understand; no 
pre-BIP16 miner is going to allow BIP16 into the blockchain because it's not 
going to pass the IsStandard() test.

I'd repeat: the reasonable thing to do is to increase the version number of 
the transaction structure to indicate that they are being processed 
differently from old transactions.
