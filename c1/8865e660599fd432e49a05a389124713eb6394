This is an absurd restriction-- I hope it was not your intent to
directly ban P2Pool and probably any other form of decentralized or
less centralized mining pooling... but thats what doing that does.

This removes important flexibility that was intentionally preserved.
What happens when an additional commitment is needed for bitcoin?
must some sidechain be irreparably destroyed? looks like it in  your
proposal.

And what happens if index 1 isn't present? if index 35 is used must
there be 34 dummy outputs?

This is not monotone/reorg safe. It means that the output coins (if
any) are not equivalently fungible with other bitcoins (for, e.g. 100
blocks) because if there is a reorg this transaction cannot be
restored to the chain.  It's also impure and not compatible with
caching, which would be unfortunate and slow block propagation.
