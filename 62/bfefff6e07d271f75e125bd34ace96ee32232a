Totally agree it really shouldnt be a vote, in the end UPnP is bad for
an individual (more bandwidth usage, etc), but good for the network.
That means people will vote against it, but in the end someone has to
make the tough decision and turn it on.

Also, bitcoind is prebuilt in the daemon folder on the download archives
(though Im not sure about OSX)
