Greg, I believe Jeff is focusing on BtcDrak's proposal (
https://gist.github.com/btcdrak/1c3a323100a912b605b5 ) where the
increased nBits are used to vote for the block size to raise
permanently ( or until it gets voted down).
His arguments don't seem to apply to your original proposal (where the
size is only increased for that block).

The potential loss does not economically compensate for size increase gains in most cases, when you consider the variability of blocks (they come in bursts and pauses) and the fee income that would be associated
