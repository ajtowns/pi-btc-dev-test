I completed a whitepaper for Bitcoin a proof-of-stake version which uses a single nomadic verifiable mint agent and distributed replication of a single blockchain by compensated full nodes to achieve 6-hop, sub-second transaction acknowledgement times. Plus it pays dividends to holders instead of wasting it on miners. Subsidized transaction fees are thus lower.

Because the code is not yet written, this idea is half-baked so to speak. Comments appreciated on my project thread, which will be a development diary. I plan a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain in early 2016, after a year of public system testing, and conditioned on wide approval.
