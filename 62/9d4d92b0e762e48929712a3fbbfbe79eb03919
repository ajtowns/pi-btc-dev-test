This seems like a fairly indirect approach. The resource being watched
for is not the size (otherwise two transactions for 200k would be
strictly worse than one 200k transactions) but the potential of N^2
costs related to repeated hashing in checksig; which this ignores.

The cost of the indirection is forclosing future applications which
involve larger signatures but have no quadratic component and are thus
fast to verify-- or requring yet another hard fork to remove the
limit, or a kludgy soft fork that splits the same data across two
"transactions" which get processed as a unit... all would be
unfortunate.

Alternative 1 sounds more attractive to be for this reason as it's more direct.
