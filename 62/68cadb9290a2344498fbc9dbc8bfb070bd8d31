Personally, I have little preference, sipa and gmaxwell fall on the side
of cherry-pick, but I think it might be good to do a broad-base test of
CWallet in 0.3.24 so potential bugs can be found in it before crypto and
0.4. In either case, I dont think we should spend too much time as this
is just a minor update release, just get it out the door so we can focus
on 0.4 (hopefully) without interruption.
