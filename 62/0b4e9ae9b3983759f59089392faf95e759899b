Message-ID: <CA+s+GJA5D3s5ch_e8k09Yk9W5euMoU-UVVViLXSTgC-fgZx6mA@mail.gmail.com>

FYI rc2 has been uploaded last weekend to
https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.3/test/, with some further fixes in
network and memory behaviour

- Remove a useless millisleep in socket handler
- Stricter memory limits on CNode
- Better orphan transaction handling
- Add `-maxorphantx=<n>` and `-maxorphanblocks=<n>` options for
control over the maximum orphan counts
