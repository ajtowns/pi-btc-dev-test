 The only reason someone would want to make a license is so they can sue/threaten people for not following the license rules. At best this is pointless since Bitcoin cannot be controlled, and at worst it will result in a group of people using coercion against the community to gain profits. 
 
 There is no legal ground for anyone to make a Bitcoin license, it simply wouldn't stand in court. Not even the MIT license is valid or meaningful. But I wouldn't be surprised if people tried scaring people with a license even if they knew it was invalid.
    
    
    It's actually disgusting that you wrote what people are allowed and not allowed to do with Bitcoin. Pure centralization ideology. Maybe go work for the government and make regulations instead of trying to centralize one of the only de-centralized things left on the planet.

Hello,  
   
  
  
We believe the network requires a block chain licence to supplement the existing MIT Licence which we believe only covers the core reference client software.  
  
   
  
  
Replacing or amending the existing MIT Licence is beyond the scope of this draft BIP.  
  
   
  
  
Rationale and details of our draft BIP for discussion and evaluation are here:

Regards,  
  
   
  
  
Ahmed
