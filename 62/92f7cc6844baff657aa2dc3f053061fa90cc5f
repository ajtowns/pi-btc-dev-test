Yes, an attacker can continuously try to do this, losing all (and only)
fees.
They will succeed every time they mine a block after the to-be-double-spent
transaction is placed by the current leader. So a microblock + delay is
stronger
than a zero-confirmation transaction, but not as strong as a first-block
confirmation.

A game theory analysis is indeed difficult here, mainly since the
assumptions
are not entirely clear. We are working towards this, starting with
formalizing
the attacker's incentive structure.
