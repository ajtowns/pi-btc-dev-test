Re: the unprunable accumulators, that doesn't need to be an inherent property
of Zcash/Monero style systems.

It'd be quite feasible to use accumulator epochs and either make unspent coins
in a previous epoch unspendable after some expiry time is reached - allowing
the spent coin accumulator data to be discarded - or make use of a merkelized
key-value scheme with transaction provided proofs to shift the costs of
maintaining the accumulator to wallets.

The disadvantage of epoch schemes is of course a reduced k-anonymity set, but
if I understand the Confidential Transactions proposals correctly, they already
have a significantly reduced k-anonymity set per transaction than Zcash
theoretically could (modulo it's in practice low anonymity set due to lack of
actual usage). In that respect, epoch size is simply a tradeoff between state
size and k-anonymity set size.
