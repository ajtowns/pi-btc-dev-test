Having control of the site gives you a cert regardless, as several CAs
will issue a cert to anyone who can make a http page appear at a
specific URL at the domain when requested via the CA over http.

It really is darn near pretextual security in this kind case? only
protecting you against attacks near the client, not the server? but as
Wladimir says, it's expected and I don't see how it would be a harm.

The revocation argument is somewhat interesting, especially since any
such site should use HSTS or otherwise a downgrade attack is trivial.
