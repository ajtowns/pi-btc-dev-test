Operation mod the group order is how secret keys must be combined in
type-2 private derivation for BIP-32. It's also absolutely essential
if you want to build a secret sharing scheme in which the shares are
usable for threshold ECDSA.

I still repeat my concern that any private key secret sharing scheme
really ought to be compatible with threshold ECDSA, otherwise we're
just going to have another redundant specification.
