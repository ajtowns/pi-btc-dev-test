Quoting from RFC 3986, Section 3.4. Query:  "The characters slash ("/")
and question mark ("?") may represent data within the query component."

Thanks for testing this. It would be interesting to know what device and
software you used for scanning. But anyway, it falls into the same
ballpark as my tests.

So BIP72 with a BT URI in the 'r' parameter?
