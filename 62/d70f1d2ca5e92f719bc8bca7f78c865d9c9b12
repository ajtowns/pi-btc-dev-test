I'm a big proponent of a testing project.

I think if one could self organize that Gavin and team wanted to bless we
could put up some BTC as bounties or funding. We won't have our heads
around the foundation budget for a few more weeks, but self-organization is
often slower than budgeting. :)

This is just my opinion, but I would like very, very much to move the
current specification into unit tests so that anyone could validate their
alternate bitcoin implementation. This is a lot of work, some of which has
been done, much of which hasn't.

So, my two cents, plus an offer to bring it up at our next budgeting
meeting.

Peter
