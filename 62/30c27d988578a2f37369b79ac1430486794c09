Wordlist is necessary for the step [seed]->[mnemonic]. Step
[mnemonic]->[bip32 root] doesn't need any wordlist, there's just hashing
involved.
For this reason client can generate whatever mnemonic and unless all
clients use the same process [mnemonic]->[bip32 root], the result is the
same.

Trezor generates the seed and transforms it to mnemonic (which is then
shown on internal display). Generating the mnemonic outside the client-side
(computer) is one of main functionality of Trezor.
