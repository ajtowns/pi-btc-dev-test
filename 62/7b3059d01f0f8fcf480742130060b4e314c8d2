The `n` is the curve order, as shown here:

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1

This step is necessary to keep you on the curve. The
secp256k1_ec_privkey_tweak_add function from libsecp256k1 handles this
automatically, but if you use OpenSSL or some non-EC math library, you
probably have to do it yourself.
