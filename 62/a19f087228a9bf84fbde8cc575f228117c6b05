We shouldn't need a new protocol [extension] for every new policy. Obviously 
this can't be perfectly flexible, but supporting different feerate definition 
versions is trivial and obvious.

In Core, they aren't (but Core never uses bloom filters anyway) - because 
otherwise it would leak privacy. But light clients (particularly overlapping 
with those that use bloom filters!) have no privacy in the first place, so 
they have no reason to use this rule.
