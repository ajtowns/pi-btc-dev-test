Yes, certainly an RLE-style compression would work better in this instance,
but I wanted to see how well standard compression algorithms would work
without doing something custom. If there are other standard compression
schemes better suited to this, please let me know.

As far as relevance, I'll clarify that the intention is to compress the
bitfields when sending proofs of spentness/unspentness to light clients,
where bandwidth is a concern. As you note, the bitfields are small enough
that it's probably not necessary to store the compressed versions on full
nodes. Though lz4 is fast enough that it may be worthwhile to compress
before saving to disk.
