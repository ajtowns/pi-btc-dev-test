+1. BIP70 is important. We want to keep it very simple and generalized, or there is a very real risk that implementers will either not bother with it or implement it in buggy, poorly standardized ways. 

Any information not required by the machine should only exist in human-oriented fields (namely, the memo field). 

Let's try to avoid ending up with another horrendously complicated, edge-case-oriented protocol like we programmers frequently complain about.
