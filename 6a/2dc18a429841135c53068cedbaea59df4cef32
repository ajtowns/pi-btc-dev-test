Yeah, good point. If you have a cert, we have the CN from the cert, which  
becomes the string displayed as 'Pay To' and alternatively 'Merchant'.

But if there's no cert then all you have is memo.

So the best way to differentiate signed requests is by prominently  
displaying that Merchant string. Really the green part should just be the  
'Pay To' line, the rest is content. If it showed a BLANK 'Pay To' that  
would make the lack of certificate highly apparent.
