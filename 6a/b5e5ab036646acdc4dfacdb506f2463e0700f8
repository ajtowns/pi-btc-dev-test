any Java Card supporting ECC can sign on user supplied Weierstrass curve
parameters - you can find a good shopping list at
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvenda/jcsupport.html (look for ALG_ECDSA_SHA256 on
javacard.crypto.signature). The NXP JCOP platform (found in Yubico Neo) is
a popular choice, and then you can add your own custom logic for validation.
