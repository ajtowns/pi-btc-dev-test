Mailman isn't resigning it.  Should it be?  Does other mailing list
software?

I understand the reason to protect the "heavily phished" domains.  I heard
that LKML does not modify the subject or add a footer, perhaps because it
would make it incompatible with DKIM of the several big corporate domains
who participate.

footers if we have no choice...
