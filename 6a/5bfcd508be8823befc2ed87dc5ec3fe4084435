Thanks! I'd love to see this library become usable behind a command line
flag or config setting. At some point we're going to want to switch to it.

I believe the main issue at the moment is the malleability issues? If so,
it would seem possible to use OpenSSL to parse the signature into
components and then libsecp256k1 to verify them.
