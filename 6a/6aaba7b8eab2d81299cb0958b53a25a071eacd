Not sure how you interpret a tautology as doublespeak.

I'm addressing the hard fork proposal (see subject line).

Changes to consensus rules change the value of coins, which are property
of their owners. Nobody owes a miner a promise of consistent revenue for
future work. Cost or benefit to miners is relevant only to the extent
that those who hold money believe it will affect their value and
therefore consider it in their decision to consent.

How is the small group of experts today different from the small group
of experts tomorrow?

This is precisely the issue. The precedent of hard-forking to "fix" the
money is a precedent for establishing authority over the money.

But of course the losses would not be entirely operational, since
hardware (at a minimum) does not depreciate to zero because of a
halving. The ability to plan does not change this fact. There are
certainly similar considerations for labor, bandwidth, space and even
electrical/cooling costs (contracts). To the extent that these costs are
sunk (as Tier said) *any* earnings are better than none.

Of course, how could they not?

... which also ignores fees.
