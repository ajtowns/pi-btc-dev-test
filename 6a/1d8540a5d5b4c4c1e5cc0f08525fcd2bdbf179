I've modified the gitian build so that it builds against Qt 4.6
instead of Qt 4.8 in this pull request:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4094

A test build of master with that pulls gitian descriptor is available:

https://download.visucore.com/bitcoin/linux-4765b8c-gitian-2d48b96.tar.gz.sig

These bitcoin-qt executables *should* work on Debian Squeeze / Tails
Linux. Let me know if it is the case.
