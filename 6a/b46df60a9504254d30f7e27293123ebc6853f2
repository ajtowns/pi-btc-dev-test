Thanks Nina and Andrew, I may have the capability to run a simulator large
scale on many nodes on AWS/GCE, but am looking to optimize the ROI by
selecting categories of experiments that benefit from a more controlled
environment, rather than be invalidated by its divergence/s from livenet.
But wondering if anyone else has already been doing this, would be nice to
collaborate.
