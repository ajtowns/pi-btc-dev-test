I was actually waiting for this. It makes 'smart contracts' simpler
and better from many points of view.

Pete I don't see anything about RCLTV in BIP65, was that a separate
BIP? Which one is it and are we also deploying it via
IsSuperMajority()? RCLTV in addition to CLTV would be trivial so maybe
we can take the pain just once?
