Fair point, but you need to understand that all specs created by the W3C
are committed to be royalty free.  That's why there's a CLA, but I can
totally see if you or your employer feels uncomfortable with that.  You
might have the best possible interests, but not everyone may be as honest.

Personally, have participated as an unaffiliated volunteer and hobbyist at
the W3C for a few years, I've never seen an issue with this.  In fact, I'm
really happy that they have a bullet proof intellectual property framework
that guarantees all my contributions will never be encumbered by patents or
be charged royalties for.
