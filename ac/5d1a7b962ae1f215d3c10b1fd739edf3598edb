This scheme is independent of the number of accounts. It works with BIP44
as well as BIP43 purpose 0, or any other BIP43 purpose/layout. Instead of
overloading the account index to indicate the type of address, you use the
chain index, which is already being used to indicate what the specific
address chain is to be used for, i.e. receive vs change addresses.
