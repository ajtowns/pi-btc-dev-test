Our message may have crossed in the mod queue:

"So can we quantify the incremental increase in security of SHA256(SHA256)
over RIPEMD160(SHA256) versus the incremental increase in security of
having a simpler implementation of segwitness?"

I believe the history of computer security is that implementation errors
and sidechannel attacks are much, much more common than brute-force breaks.
KEEP IT SIMPLE.

(and a quibble:  "do a 80-bit search for B and C such that H(A and B) = H(B
and C)"  isn't enough, you have to end up with a C public key for which you
know the corresponding private key or the attacker just succeeds in burning
the funds)
