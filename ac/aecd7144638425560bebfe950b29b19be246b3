Oops, in my enthusiasm I completely forgot that 0.7.1 is still in rc, not final.

What I merged is:
- #1901 from laanwj/2012_10_remove_strlcpy
- #1900 from Diapolo/optionsmodel_getters
- #1913 from sipa/noi2p
- #1879 from sipa/fdatasync

I don't think any of them is problematic to have in rc2. If it is, we
need to make a branch for 0.7.x at eb49457 and consider master the
0.8.x branch.
