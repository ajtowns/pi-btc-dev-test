Subject: [Bitcoin-development] [ANN] Bitcoin v0.3.23 release candidate
	available
Message-ID: <BANLkTineGhQW33aZ0oLvGf9vJY8XLxjxPg@mail.gmail.com>

Win32, Linux and source releases for bitcoin v0.3.23rc1 have been uploaded to
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.23/test/

This is another quick bugfix release, trying to deal with the influx
of new bitcoin users.

Main items of note:

* P2P connect-to-node logic changed to reduce timeout a bit.  The
network saw a huge influx of new users, who do not permit incoming
connections.  This change is a short-term hack, to more quickly hunt
for useful P2P connections.  Better "leaf node" logic is in the works,
but this should let us limp along until then.
* Transaction fee reduced to 0.0005 for new transactions (NOTE: free
transactions are, of course, still supported as they always were)
* Client will relay transactions with fees as low as 0.0001 BTC
