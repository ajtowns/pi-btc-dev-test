Again, for the last time: Bitcoin Core maintainer does not decide about protocol or consensus level changes.

This is not a role for me. Find someone else, if you think you need an arbiter. There was an idea about a Bitcoin Standards Body once, but as far as I know that's not actively being worked on.

BTW: for more exposure a proposal is better posted as a new thread, not as a deep reply to an existing topic.
