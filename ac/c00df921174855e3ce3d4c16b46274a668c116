Being Mr. Torrent, I've held open the "80% serious" suggestion to
simply refuse to serve blocks older than X (3 months?).

That forces download by other means (presumably torrent).

I do not feel it is productive for any nodes on the network to waste
time/bandwidth/etc. serving static, ancient data.  There remain, of
course, issues of older nodes and "getting the word out" that prevents
this switch from being flipped on tomorrow.
