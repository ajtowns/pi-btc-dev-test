Oh, and I just checked, and Mike's original pull-req for the Tor
blacklist didn't include the proxy disable code; what's in master != the
pull-req, so the OP may have been looking at the wrong code by accident.
(I personally noticed this issue in the pull-req and didn't realise it
hadn't been merged into master w/o modifications)

https://github.com/mikehearn/bitcoinxt/commit/931a4d59a03c7e64d7d85ddfc07ae127533c7f28#diff-11780fa178b655146cb414161c635219R171

Kinda sloppy of Mike to be making changes in master that don't
correspond to the peer-reviewed pull-req code...
