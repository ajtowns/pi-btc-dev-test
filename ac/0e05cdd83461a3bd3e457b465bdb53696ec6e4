Am suggesting a (possible) mitigation of [possible flooding, etc], via
some kind of discussion (potentially process BIP, related to bundling and
/ or randomization) not now, but down the road.  However, needs more
thought and analysis (you mentioned code audit?) before it could be
floated around or acted on in any way shape or form.  Thanks for this
discussion, things to think about.... am watching, listening (...)
