...in the same way going to university may be one of the more valuable things you ever do. But using the code resulting from that process over Satoshi Bitcoin/libconsensus is foolish.

I suggest you actually look at the git commit history for the consensus-critical part of the Bitcoin Core codebase - so much work cleaning it up and refactoring has been done for v0.10.0/libconsensus that I think we're risking the introduction of a consensus bug unnecessarily and should slow down a little.

"holy scripture" it ain't.

Again, this is exactly what people are working towards, at a speed that if anything is probably a bit too rapid.
