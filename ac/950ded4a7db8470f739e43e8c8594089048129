I'm not sure I see the problem. The scriptPubKey is derived directly
from the address in all cases, which means the unknown witness version
would have to be committed to in the address itself.

So yeah, I can make a P2SH address with a witness version > 0 and a to
me unknown pubkey and then fool you into thinking I own it, but I
don't really see why you'd ultimately care. In other words, if I can
SPEND funds sent to that address today, I can prove that I can spend
today, which is the purpose of the tool, I think.

For the case where the witness version HAS been upgraded, the above
still applies, but I'm not sure it's a big issue. And it doesn't
really require an old node. I just need to set witness version >
current witness version and the problem applies to all nodes.

All right.

I assume by inputs you mean addresses/keys. The address field could
optionally be an array. That'd be enough?

I'd love to not have to reveal the public key, but I'm not sure how it
would be done, even with MAST.

That seems sensible to me. A warning would probably be useful, in case
the verifier is running old software.
