Before considering a hard fork with unpredictable effects on the 
uncertainty window, it would be interesting to look at a soft fork that 
would directly target the goal of reducing the uncertainty window, like 
treating locally-detected double-spends aged > T as invalid (see earlier 
message "A statistical consensus rule for reducing 0-conf double-spend 
risk").

If anything is worth a soft fork, wouldn't reducing the double-spend 
uncertainty window by an order of magnitude be in the running?

Reducing the reasons that transactions don't get relayed, which actually 
seems to have a shot of happening pretty soon, would also make this kind 
of thing work better.
