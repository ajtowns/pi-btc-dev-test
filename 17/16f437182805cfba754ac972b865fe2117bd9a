1) It's not really clear to me how that would work, but assuming it does
then it will go into a basket of attacks that are possible but unlikely due
to the economic disincentives to do so.

2) That said, is the Achilles heal of this proposal the lack of a mechanism
to lower the block size?

3) Let me put it another way, I've read that both Gavin and yourself are
favorable to a dynamic limit on the block size. In your view, what is
missing from this proposal, or what variables should be adjusted, to get
the rules to a place where you and other Core developers would seriously
consider it?
