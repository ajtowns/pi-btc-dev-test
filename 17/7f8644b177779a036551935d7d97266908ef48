While I am not opposing the proposal, I am not sure about your statistics
because while Counterparty is not currently using OP_RETURN encoding, you
should factor in the number of CP transactions that would have been
OP_RETURNs if they had been permitted (100,000 since inception according
their blog[1] with monthly charts at their block explorer[2]).
