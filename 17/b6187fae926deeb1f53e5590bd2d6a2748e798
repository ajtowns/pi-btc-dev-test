Sorry for going out of topic on that thread, I have just created
another thread to discuss this particular point (whether schism
hardforks can be universally predicted to collapse into a single chain
or not), which is a fundamental part of BIP99 discussion and I believe
technical enough for this list (assuming that we stay on topic). But
the moderation thinks it's not relevant enough for this list, we can
move it to the discussion mailing list or private emails.

Of course, their technical difference come from the fact they are
technically different. That's not what I meant.
There's no technical argument that lets you predict whether
eliminating one rule or the other will be more or less acceptable to
users.
There's no technical difference that I can see in that reward.
I think these two examples strike people as "obviously different" just
because they are morally different, but I want to avoid moral
judgments in BIP99.

Those were unintentional hardforks. There's an example of a failed
schism hardfork: when some people changed the subsidy/issuance rules
to maintain the 50 btc block subsidy constant.
It didn't failed because of "tremendous pressure": it failed because
the users and miners of the alternative ruleset abandoned it. If they
hadn't, the two incompatible chains would still grow in parallel.

Yes, there could be arbitrage and speculators selling "on both sides"
is also a possibility.
At some point we would arrive to some kind of price equilibrium,
different for each of the coins. BIP99 states that those prices are
unpredictable (or at least there's no general method to predict the
result without knowing the concrete case, the market, etc) and in fact
states that the resulting price for both sides could be going to close
to zero market capitalization.
That still doesn't say anything about one side having to "surrender".
The coin that ends up with the lowest price (and consequently, the
lowest block reward and hashrate) can still continue, maybe even for
longer than the side that appeared to be "victorious" after the
initial arbitrage.
I haven't heard any convincing arguments about schism hardforks having
to necessarily collapse into a single chain and until I do I'm not
going to adapt BIP99 to reflect that.

Yes, I have control: all users (including miners) have direct control
over the rules that software they run validates.
You cannot ever have your coins stolen in the longest valid chain you
follow if the validity rules you use enforce property ownership.
No majority can force you to move to the new non-ownership rules, just
like no majority can force you to move to any different set of rules.
If we accept the notion that a groups of users could resist to
deploying this particular rule changes and keep operating under the
old rules, we have to accept that this can happen for any
controversial hardfork, and that we cannot predict a common lifecycle
for all schism hardforks.
