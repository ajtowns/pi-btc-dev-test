Agreed.  Unfortunately, a simple "block version >= 4" check is
insufficient, due to XT which sets version bits 001....111.

Given that, I suggest using the simple test:

        if (pstart->nVersion & 0x8)
            ++nFound;

Which means:
1) XT won't trigger it.
2) It won't trigger XT.
3) You can simply set block nVersion to 8 for now.
4) We can still use versionbits in parallel later.

Cheers,
Rusty.
