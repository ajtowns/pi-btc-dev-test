Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Number Request: Addresses over Audio
Message-ID: <CAL9WuQUUeR3cuUXHxUfBTNJ-+r0iJ-7Z8KRNub0G3NBujnkqcw@mail.gmail.com>

This is my BIP idea: a fast, robust, and standardized for representing
Bitcoin addresses over audio. It takes the binary representation of the
Bitcoin address (little endian), chops that up into 4 or 2 bit chunks
(depending on type, 2 bit only for low quality audio like american
telephone lines), and generates a tone based upon that value. This started
because I wanted an easy way to donate to podcasts that I listen to, and
having a Shazam-esque app (or a media player with this capability) that
gives me an address automatically would be wonderful for both the consumer
and producer. Comes with error correction built into the protocol

You can see the full specification of the BIP on my GitHub page (
