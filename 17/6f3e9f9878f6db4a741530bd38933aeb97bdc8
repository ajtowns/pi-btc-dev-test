Ooh nice graphs!

We were coincidentally talking about showing stats from a node on a
local web site on the #bitcoin-dev IRC a few days ago.

At some point, if we're going to offer Bitcoin Core node-only
installers, it'd be nice to include something like this so the user
can keep an eye on their node(s).
