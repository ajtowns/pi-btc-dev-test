Well, the block chain data itself is internally self-validating.  As
long as you know the latest block's hash -- a big "if" -- there is no
problem downloading all other block chain data from DHT or any other
untrusted source.

In a malicious case, you would notice latest-hash differs from
non-malicious and wind up downloading multiple chains, when walking
hashes backwards through a DHT/lookup table.  So, a bit more work but
nothing fundamentally less secure _on a trust basis_.

Of course, I was focusing on data validation, which ignores other
factors such as DoS'ing the DHT.
