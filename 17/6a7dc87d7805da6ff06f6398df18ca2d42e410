It would be a shame to prohibit someone from rewarding whoever mines their
transaction.  A good example would be a transaction designed to record some
information which is damning to powerful authorities, sort of like the
service cryptograffiti offers.  When we try to protect others by
prohibiting behavior we think is foolish, we may save some fools, but at
the same time, we hurt the best of us.
