Yes! Lets plan for success!

I'd really like to move from "IMPOSSIBLE because...  (electrum hasn't been
optimized
(by the way: you should run on SSDs, LevelDB isn't designed for spinning
disks),
what if the network is attacked?  (attacked HOW???), current p2p network is
using
the simplest, stupidest possible block propagation algorithm...)"

... to "lets work together and work through the problems and scale it up."

I'm frankly tired of all the negativity here; so tired of it I've decided
to mostly ignore
all the debate for a while, not respond to misinformation I see being spread
(like "miners have some incentive to create slow-to-propagate blocks"),
work with people like Tom and Mike who have a 'lets get it done' attitude,
and
focus on what it will take to scale up.
