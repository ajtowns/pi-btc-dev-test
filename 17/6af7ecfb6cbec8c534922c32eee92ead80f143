Point to this solved problem?

Your "solution" here is not a solution:

Let's assume you invented a simple way to double-spend txns to self (which you haven't, fyi), then that is an issue in of itself as the point of bitcoin is to *prevent* double-spending to self.

There would need to be much more time for the community to discuss the implications of wallets have a "double-spend to self" button in them.

Yes it does destroy same-chain fungibility, as discussed on twitter [1], you're making miner coins special on both chains.

> Lack of replay protection does not mean there is no coin.

It effectively does. If people want to proceed blindly, ignoring replay, they're welcome to read about the consequences [2].
