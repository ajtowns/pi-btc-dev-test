vanitygen can generate keypairs pretty fast (on my CPU it's comparable
with hashing time), and there are ways to make it faster.  Since you can
generate multiple script variations, too, I think hashing is the
bottleneck.

Antminer S7 can do 4.73 Terahash per second for $1.2k.  (Double SHA, but
let's assume RIPEMD160(SHA256()) is the same speed).

766,760,562,123 seconds to do 3*2^80, so you'd need over 200 million
S7s to do it in an hour.[1] If you want to do that for $1M, wait 27
years and hope Moore's Law holds?

Also, a colleague points out you could use this attack against a site
like bitrated.com which publishes one side's pubkey, giving you a much
longer attack window.
     
Cheers,
Rusty.
[1] Weirdly, the bitcoin network is doing this much work every 57
    days, for about $92M.  If that's all the attack costs, it's under
    1M in 10 years.
