So, there could not be, for example, a user decision to activate it?
(versus not activate it)?  I'm wondering if something about this can
be boiled down to allowing the user to make a choice on the matter
(turn it on and off).  In Bitcoin-NG, the protocol as follows (as
described in a general overview of it): every 10 minutes, NG elects a
'leader,' who then vets future transactions as soon as they happen. NG
approach supposedly can run as fast as the network will allow.

If this is the case, and if NG functions without major hiccup,
shouldn't a user (of Core, for example) be able to be given the option
to choose between:

(a) being limited by the blocksize and block interval, or
(b) running out as fast as the network will allow (NG)?

The other questions I had pertained to privacy.  How would this scheme
affect users who would be trying to do things like stealth or
confidential transactions?
