By the way, the Java Web Start system has improved a lot in recent versions
as well. I just tried running http://jfxtras.org/ and this was the
experience:

   - It told me my Java was insecure and that I should download the latest
   version (hah). It had three buttons, one saying "Update", one saying "Block
   content in browser" and one saying "Later". So it seems Java learned how to
   disable its plugin by itself anyway. I think on non-Linux platforms it
   probably knows how to update itself as well these days.
   - As it happens I don't care right now because jfxtras is a source I
   trust, so I clicked later and it popped up a permission screen saying the
   author was unknown, could damage my computer, etc. Actually, Jim has a code
   signing cert so this would show his identity at that point.
   - Clicked run. The app downloaded in a few seconds and was running.
   - JavaWS keeps the app up to date for you at that point.

It's triggered by downloading and opening a .jnlp file, so - same security
boundaries as a regular app download, except you download metadata for the
runtime instead of the whole app at once.

It might be worth providing a JNLP option on the multibit webpage as well,
as although I wouldn't let the applet plugin in my browser, once I made an
explicit decision to go to multibit.org and trust James Burton with my
money, the JWS experience at that point is pretty good. Until we have our
own auto update engine it's better than nothing.
