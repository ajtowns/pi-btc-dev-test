Nice work, Pieter. You're right that my simulation assumed bandwidth for
'block' messages isn't the bottleneck.

But doesn't Matt's fast relay network (and the work I believe we're both
planning on doing in the near future to further optimize block propagation)
make both of our simulations irrelevant in the long-run?

Or, even simpler, why couldn't the little miners just run their
block-assembling-and-announcing code on the other high-bandwidth-side of
the bandwidth bottleneck?
