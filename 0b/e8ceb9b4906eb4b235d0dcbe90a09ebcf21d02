We're going ahead with "bitcoin-dev".  A request for creation is now
pending.

Off-list I heard a suggestion to make the cut-off date as short as one week
after the new list is announced and people are given the option to
subscribe.  Could people please post feelings about this?

It seems most everyone agreed not to auto-subscribe everyone onto the new
list as that tends to be upsetting.

There is clarity if subscribing the old list to the new list is a good
idea.  Is anyone familiar with Mailman, is it smart enough to somehow
prevent double-posts if someone writes to both the old and new address?
