I'm not sure who wrote segwit.org, but I wouldn't take it as
authoritative reasoning why we must do X over Y.

You seem to be claiming that there is not cost for a miner to fill
"extra witness space", but this is very untrue - in order to do so they
must forgo fees on other transactions. Your analysis on worst-case vs
normal-case blocks also seems flawed - there is a single limit, and not
a separate, secondary, witness limit.

You suggested "If the maximum block weight is set to 2.7M, each byte of
non-witness block costs 1.7", but these numbers dont work out - setting
the discount to 1.7 gets you a maximum block size of 1.7MB (in a soft
fork), not 2.7MB. If you set the max block weight to 2.7 with a 1.7x
discount, you have a hard fork. If you set the discount to 2.7x with a
2.7 weight limit, you dont get 2.7MB average-sized blocks, but smaller,
and still have the potential for padding blocks with pure-witness data
to create larger blocks.

Additionally, note that by padding blocks with larger witness data you
lose some of the CPU cost to validate as you no longer have as many
inputs (which have a maximal validation cost).

Further, I'm not sure why you're arguing for a given witness discount on
the basis of a future hardfork - it seems highly unlikely the community
is in a position to pull something like that off, and even if it were,
why set the witness discount with that assumption? If there were to be a
hardfork, we should probably tweak a bunch of parameters (see, eg, my
post from February of last year at
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-February/012403.html).

Maybe you could clarify your proposal a bit here, because the way I read
it you seem to have misunderstood SegWit's discount system.
