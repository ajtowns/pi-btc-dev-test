Hmmm ;) Didn't you just make an assumption about the future price?

The currencies I'm familiar with are CHF, USD, EUR and GBP, which all have
roughly similar values. I guess such currencies make up the bulk of the
Bitcoin userbase at the moment.

Saying "it's already popular and would take work to change" is not really a
fallacy now, is it?

But anyway, this is getting silly. You don't have to convince me. Go visit

switching is the best use of their time :o
