IIRC, it is actually increased by ~81 bytes, and doesn't count witness data if 
on Segwit transactions (so in effect, nearly 4 MB transactions are possible). 
This probably doesn't make the hashing problem worse, however it should be 
made clear in the BIP.

Citations do not support the claim.

This is deceptive and meaningless. There is no reason to *ever* refer to the 
size of the block serialised without witness programs. It is not a meaningful 
number.

What is modified here? "segsignal" does not appear in the BIP 91 protocol at 
all...

A "plain block size limit" of 2 MB would be a no-op. It would have literally 
no effect whatsoever on the network rules.

Furthermore, this does not match what btc1/Segwit2x currently implements at 
all. The actual implementation is: If Segwit (via deployment method) activates 
at block N, then block N+12960 activates a new weight limit of 8M (which 
corresponds to a size of up to 8,000,000 bytes).

What is the rationale for excluding witness data from this measurement?

Actual network growth does not reflect a pattern that supports this claim.

Larger block sizes is not likely to have a meaningful impact on fee pressure. 
Any expectations that do not match the reality are merely misguided, and 
should not be a basis for changing Bitcoin.
