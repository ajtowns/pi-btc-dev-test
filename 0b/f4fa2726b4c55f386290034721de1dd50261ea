Note that this would be a massive, *massive* change that would
completely break bitcoin output frangibility. Merchants would have to
start demanding input history back to a certain depth in order to ensure
they are not exposing themselves to undue reorg-expiry risk.

There are useful applications of a consensus-enforced expiry,
particularly within a private (signed block) side chain, and for that
reason it is useful to have a discussion about the merits of an nExpiry
field or BLOCK_HEIGHT / BLOCK_TIME opcode, and methods for achieving
either. However I don't see this ever becoming part of the public
bitcoin network.
