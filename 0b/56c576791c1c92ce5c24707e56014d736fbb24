If this is just encoding BIP-21 addresses, it is basically an "audio QR
code". In this case, does publishing it as a BIP still make sense? (Not
to imply that it doesn't, but it's something you should consider.)

Please look at existing implementations of audio modems when creating
your design. A lot of this work has been done many times before, so
there is a lot to learn from.

Your selected frequencies are harmonics of each other, meaning nonlinear
distortion will make detection more difficult. The Bell 202 and similar
modem standards chose AFSK frequencies to minimize interference.

Repeating a message multiple times is a very inefficient method of error
recovery. It works, but there may be better techniques, such as trellis
modulation or other convolutional codes.

Defining channel models to simulate your various use cases will help a
lot to determine if you have met your requirements.

P.S. I also briefly considered audio to exchange transactions with a
hardware wallet. Using GNU Radio made the implementation much easier.
