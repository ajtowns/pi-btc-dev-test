Tom,

It's clear that you have some rather large gaps in your knowledge of Bitcoin, its rules, implementation and game theory. I highly encourage you spend some time learning more about these things before continuing posting here. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/ is a good place to start. It's a safe place where you can ask any question you want without fear of being laughed at.

Kind regards,


Jean-Paul
