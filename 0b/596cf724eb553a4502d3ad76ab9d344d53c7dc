Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 21 accepted, new BIP 19
Message-ID: <1328445712.12150.YahooMailNeo@web121003.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

BIP 21 had broad consensus among the major implementations:

BIP 19 is a document to propose adding a new payment type to the scripting system's template list.

I haven't fully evaluated it completely but it seems solid. My only thoughts is that it uses a bunch of arithmetic operators which can behave in strange ways.
