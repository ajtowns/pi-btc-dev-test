I think your "hardfork bit" proposal is clever.
It addresses the particular valid concern of re-org facing users of a
fork that a small/near/fluctuating majority, or less, of mining power
supported.
While the "economic majority" argument may be enough on its own in
that case, it still has some aspect of being a hand wave.
This proposal adds support to those economic actors, which makes it
easier for them to switch if/when they choose. That is, it provides a
good fallback mechanism that allows them to make a decision and say,
"we're doing this".
Do you have the latest version up on github, or someplace where it
would be easier to collaborate on the specific text?
