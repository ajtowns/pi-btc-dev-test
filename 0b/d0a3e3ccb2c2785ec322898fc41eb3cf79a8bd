How is github a hurdle?

It's easy enough to create a fork and submit back the changes as a pull
request.

In the case of text documents, this can be completely done through the web
interface.

If anything creating a github account is a smaller hurdle than having to
pay to create a wiki account and wait for it to be activated.

Aside: my proposal is for the BIPs that are already accepted, and should
not be edited without dicussion. If people want to put their drafts in the
wiki that's a different story.

Regards,
Wladimir
