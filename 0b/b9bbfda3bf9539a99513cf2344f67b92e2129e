HMAC has proven security property.
It is still secure even when underlying crypto hashing function has
collision resistant weakness.
For example, MD5 is considered completely insecure now, but HMAC-MD5 is
still considered secure.
When in doubt, we should always use HMAC for MAC(Message Authentication
Code) rather than custom construction
