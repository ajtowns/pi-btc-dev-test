Subject: [bitcoin-dev] The DCS Theorem - theory for understanding blockchain
	scalability
Message-ID: <E9C2F990-BAFA-4FA5-A6D2-AB1327B7E078@taoeffect.com>

The DCS Triangle was independently discovered by myself and Trent McConaghy.

It is a useful tool for clearing confusion about blockchain scalability and blocksize-related debates.

The DCS Theorem is a probability proof of the triangle, and it's now on arXiv:

Cheers,
Greg
