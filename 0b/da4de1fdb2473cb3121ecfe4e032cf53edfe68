Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Fast Merkle Trees
Message-ID: <CAMZUoKmD4v4vn9L=kdyJNk-km3XHpNVkD_tmS+SseMsf6YaVPg@mail.gmail.com>

The fast hash for internal nodes needs to use an IV that is not the
standard SHA-256 IV. Instead needs to use some other fixed value, which
should itself be the SHA-256 hash of some fixed string (e.g. the string
"BIP ???" or "Fash SHA-256").

As it stands, I believe someone can claim a leaf node as an internal node
by creating a proof that provides a phony right-hand branch claiming to
have hash 0x80000..0000100 (which is really the padding value for the
second half of a double SHA-256 hash).

(I was schooled by Peter Todd by a similar issue in the past.)
