I did not intend to imply that there was agreement on a desire to
schedule a second hardfork. My wording may have been a bit too loose.
Instead, I believe there was much agreement that doing a short-term
hardfork now, with many agreeing that a second would hopefully be
entirely unnecessary/impossible, while others thought that a second
would be necessary and would have to happen. While this may set up a
similar controversy again in several years, I think everyone agreed that
we cannot predict the future and I, personally, think none of us should
be committing to a viewpoint for what should be done at that time.

Personally, I think it is also critical that there be no messaging that
people should rely on or assume there will be a future increase after a
short-term bump (which I also do not believe people should be relying on
now).
