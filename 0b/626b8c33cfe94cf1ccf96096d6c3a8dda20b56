I think this is a bit well, sad, at the moment--  a basic principle in
sound decision making is that one should try to withhold judgement
until after the analysis and options are laid out to avoid prematurely
laying down "battle lines" which then they're socially and politically
committed to a particular answer.


There are several other BIPs in the works right now that aren't out
there yet, as well (as presumably) new insight from the workshop. It
would be a shame if these things would be for naught because of being
decided prematurely.
