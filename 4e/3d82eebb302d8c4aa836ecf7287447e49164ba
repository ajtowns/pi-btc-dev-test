Yes, but keep in mind the meta risk, which is that as Bitcoin becomes
centralized one of the types of transactions that will be censored are
ones that preserve your privacy. For instance, as it costs thousands of
dollars to setup a mining pool, and hence mining pools also become quite
visible, it would be very easy for local governments to start doing
things like specifying that transactions must be accompanied with a
proof of identification. With that proof of course Bitcoin can remain
totally legal, and the pool in business.

Why do you expect that? It's always harder to hide a large amount of
bandwidth than a small one, and stenography is limited by the bandwidth
of the data it's hiding it. HD video streams aren't going to require
more bandwidth in the future.

Right now the thing that keeps pools honest is that setting up another
pool is pretty easy; note how most pools are run as hobbyist projects.
Similarly you can always use P2Pool, which is totally decentralized.
But if running the validating node required to run a pool costs
thousands of dollars that competition just isn't there anymore and
starting a new pool isn't an option. Remember there will be a chicken
and egg problem in that the new pool has thousands of dollars in costs,
yet no hashing power yet.

As for constantly moving countries, The Pirate Bay is in the same
position, and as well as they've done, they still wind up getting shut
down periodically. Do you really want access to your funds contingent on
some highly visible mining pools, constantly wondering if their local
government will change their mind?


Anyway, seems that my question was answered: There aren't any clever
technical ways to avoid censorship if validating nodes and mining pools
are centralized.
