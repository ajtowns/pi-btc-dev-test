Thanks for looking at the issue.

Unfortunately, it still fails for me:

$ nslookup testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org
Server:		127.0.1.1
Address:	127.0.1.1#53

** server can't find testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org: SERVFAIL

Like I said, can you look at the logfiles how the requests arrive?

What particular thing did you fix? It would be good to know for future
outages.
