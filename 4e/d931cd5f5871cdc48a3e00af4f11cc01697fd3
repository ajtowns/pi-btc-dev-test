I still fail to see the harm caused by this attack. At some point the
attacker will get bored of laughing even if the attack has a small costs
(which I'm not that sure it is).

This is what seem to have happened with uncontroversial softforks in the
past. Why is wishful thinking to expect the same for uncontroversial
hardforks?
