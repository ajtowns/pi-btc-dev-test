The attack I'm trying to address is described here: https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Bitcoin
It was discussed here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=632124.0

It uses the following observation. Each NATed client connects to the Bitcoin network
through 8 entry peers; he also advertises his public IP address to these peers which
allows an attacker to make the mapping <8-entry-peers, client-IP-address>.
The probability for two different clients to choose
the same entry peers is negligible. When a client generates a transaction,
the entry peers of the client are likely to be the first to retransmit it.

The attacker establishes many connections to each reachable Bitcoin peer and listens
for transactions. For each transaction she records 8-10 peers which were the first to forward this tx.
As a result, if two transactions are forwarded by the same set of entry peers,
they are likely to belong to the same client. 
Also each 8-tuples has a mapping to the client's advertised IP address.
