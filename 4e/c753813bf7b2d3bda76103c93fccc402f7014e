Yeah, if anyone wants to make the letter more digestable please do propose
an alternative, although by this point it's probably not worth it as people
have already signed.

FWIW, Gregory is right that my original draft was much more brusque. The
pain in the packaging relationship travels both ways. I have in the past
wasted a lot of time due to bogus packaging applied by non-expert packagers
that broke things. In fact the project I was a part of adopted a policy of
automatically closing bug reports from people who were using distributor
packages (any distro) because the quality was so inconsistent and so many
subtle bugs were introduced.

If packagers hear upstreams cry about packaging a lot, I think you should
keep an open mind that some of them probably know what they're talking
about. We really shouldn't have to beg and cajole here. Saying "we have our
reasons and we want you to stop" should be enough.
