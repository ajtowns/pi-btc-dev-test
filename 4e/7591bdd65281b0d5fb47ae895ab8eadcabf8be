To each his own, but if I say "Please don't charge me for YOUR privacy
by putting junk like stealth addresses in the blockchain", I think I'd
get laughed out of most rooms.

Either the transaction fees are sufficient to pay the cost for whatever
random junk anyone wants to put there, or they are not, and if they are
not, then I suggest you re-think the fee structure rather than trying
to pre-regulate me putting 80 character pithy quotes in the blockhain.
