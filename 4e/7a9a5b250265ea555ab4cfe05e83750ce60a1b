You should split the block-only and block+tx not only by port number, but also
by DNS address. DoS attack by flooding blocks is fundamentally more difficult
than DoS attack by flooding transctions, so doing the split by IP address
ensures that in the event of an attack the more important block relaying
functionality is less likely to be damaged. In the meantime point both DNS
addresses to the same IP until it becomes an issue.
