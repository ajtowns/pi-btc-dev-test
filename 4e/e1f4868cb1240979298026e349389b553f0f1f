Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Wallet class merged -- rebasing needed
Message-ID: <BANLkTinuciS2cmp1XN9zefk27tCAJVF7hw@mail.gmail.com>

OK, sipa pulled his wallet code movement + wallet class stuff.

Wallet import/export and crypto will need a rebase.  Other code will
too, but those are the big ticket items that we want to merge in the
short term.
