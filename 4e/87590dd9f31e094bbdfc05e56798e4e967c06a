That complicates the implementation quite a bit.

I mostly implemented a variant that replaced the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant
with a function that took both a timestamp and a block height, and there
are several places in the current reference implementation where digging
out the block height (or, worse, calculating the median timestamp for the
block) would involve changing quite a few functions in the call-chain or
acquiring the cs_main lock to consult the current best chain.
