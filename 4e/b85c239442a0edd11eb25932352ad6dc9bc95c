Oh, here's an even better way to do the "tx drop" attack: when you drop
a transaction, make a fake one that pays the same scriptPubKeys with the
same amount, and send it to the SPV peer instead. They'll see the
transaction go through and show up in their wallet, but it'll look like
it got stuck and never confirmed. They'll soon wind up with a wallet
full of useless transactions, effectively locking them out of their
money.

Here's another question for you Mike: So does bitcoinj have any
protections against peers flooding you with useless garbage? It'd be
easy to rack up a user's data bill for instance by just creating junk
unconfirmed transactions matching the bloom filter.
