My Q and q are meant differently, I agree to your Q vs Q-1 argument,
but the q is "me as a miner" participating in "a pool" Q. If I
participate in a pool I pay the pool owner a fraction, e, but at the
same time I become part of an economy of scale (well actually a math
of scale...) and that can end up paying for the lost e. The question
is what is the ratio q/Q where I should rather mine on my own ? This
question is interesting as it will make bigger miners break away from
pools into solo mining, but I also agree that from pure math the most
advantageous scenario is the 100% mining rig.

Ha, yes, and then the math for p2pool starts... a math where we have
much more stales...
