well, it's easy to miss the point when the example you use doesn't
make the point you think you're making. :D
but ok, yes, it would be nice to send directly to something like
1brmlab from the client. i suppose figuring out how to make sure that
1brmlab actually does send to whom you think it sends, is left to the
details of implementation, but that's a separate question.
