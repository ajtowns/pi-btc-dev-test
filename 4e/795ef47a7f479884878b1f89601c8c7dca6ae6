Which is why I'm not proposing that.

You are assuming value is the same for everyone - it's not.

If I mine in a jurisdiction where zerocoin is banned, and the blocks I
mine are public, the value of zerocoin blocks to me are at best zero.
Equally it would be easy for the local authorities to ask that I merge
mine zerocoin blocks to attack the chain - it doesn't cost me anything
so what's the harm? I may even choose to do so to preserve the value of
the coins I can mine legally - alt-coins are competition.

Incedentally keep in mind it is likely that in the future pools will not
allow miners to modify the work units they receive in any way as a means
of combating block-withholding fraud; there may not be very many people
willing or able to honestly merge-mine any given chain.

Proof-of-sacrifice can be done in a way that is opaque to the master
blockchain by creating txouts that look no different from any other
txout. Hopefully not required, but it would be a good strategy against
censorship of sacrifice-based chains.

SCIP is for now a dream. Give it a few more years and see how the
technology shakes out.
