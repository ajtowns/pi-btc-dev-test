I don?t really have a strong opinion on block size either?but if we?re going to do a hard fork, let?s use this as an opportunity to create a good process for hard forks (which we?ll inevitably need to do again in the future). The change in block size is a very simple change that still allows us to explore all the complexities involved with deployment of hard forks. Let?s not just do a one-off ad-hoc thing.
