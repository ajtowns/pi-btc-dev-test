Right. Wallets are covering malleability in acceptable ways. Normal
user to user payments aren't (or at least shouldn't be) affected by
malleability.

Problems appear in second level and third level malleability, when
Alice sends txB to Bob which spends from txA which is unconfirmed. If
txA changes txid, txB becomes useless and invalidates Alice's payment.
Looking at scriptPubKeys instead of transaction IDs doesn't help in
this context.

This is the reason why some type of contracts are not workable or not
100% safe. One can't pre-sign a refund transaction with an nLockTime
in the future: the payer will provide the funding transaction ID from
which the refund tx will spend, but if the transaction ID of the
funding transaction is affected by malleability (third party
malleability, since the signer doesn't have interest to do so) the
refund tx becomes useless.
