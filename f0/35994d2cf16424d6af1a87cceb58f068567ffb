Regarding changing the e-mail list provider. Is anyone interested in 
sponsoring it? There are non-free options, but it may be difficult to 
always ensure the fee is being paid to the provider. I think finding an 
agreeable free solution may have been the issue before? I've also 
thought of trying to make a pay per message or byte solution (and this 
cost could be dynamic based upon the number of current mailing list 
subscribers). This could solve the who pays problem (the sender pays), 
as well as motivate people to be more concise and clear with their 
messages, and at the same time limit spam.



Any thoughts?
