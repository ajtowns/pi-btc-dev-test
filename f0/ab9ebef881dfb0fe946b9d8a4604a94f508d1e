He wants to use it to advertise services that are not part of the P2P
protocol itself, but run on a different port. Reserving services bits
for those is not acceptable.

All the NODE_EXT_SERVICES bit does is advertise the P2P "getextsrv"
command to get information, such as the port to connect on, for the
auxilary service.
