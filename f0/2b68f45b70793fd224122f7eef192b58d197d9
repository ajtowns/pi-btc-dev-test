Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP: register with IANA for
	bitcoin/cryptocoin port numbers
Message-ID: <20140103052243.GK3180@nl.grid.coop>

I believe this is self-explainatory:

1) Bitcoin usually runs on port 8333. Why?

2) Bitcoin does not show in up http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml .. why?

3) What needs to happen to have someone from the Bitcoin foundation 
  to fill out the form asking for an assigned port (see 
  http://www.iana.org/form/ports-services )

4) what should the process be for new cryptocoins to get both default
port numbers, as well as P2P network identifier 'magic numbers'
