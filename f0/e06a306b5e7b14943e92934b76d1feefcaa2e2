Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Schnorr signatures BIP
Message-ID: <CAPg+sBj7f+=OYXuOMdNeJk3NBG67FSQSF8Xv3seFCvwxCWq69A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Here is a proposed BIP for 64-byte elliptic curve Schnorr signatures,
over the same curve as is currently used in ECDSA:
https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki

It is simply a draft specification of the signature scheme itself. It
does not concern consensus rules, aggregation, or any other
integration into Bitcoin - those things are left for other proposals,
which can refer to this scheme if desirable. Standardizing the
signature scheme is a first step towards that, and as it may be useful
in other contexts to have a common Schnorr scheme available, it is its
own informational BIP.

If accepted, we'll work on more production-ready reference
implementations and tests.

This is joint work with several people listed in the document.

Cheers,
