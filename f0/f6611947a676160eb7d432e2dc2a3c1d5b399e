Be aware that the issue is more problematic for more complex contracts.
For example, you are building a P2SH 2-of-2 multisig together with someone
else if you are not careful, party A can hand their key over to party B,
who can may try to generate a collision between their second key and
another 2-of-2 multisig where they control both keys. See
