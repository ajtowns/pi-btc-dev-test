Subject: [bitcoin-dev] The increase of max block size should be determined
 by block height instead of block time
Message-ID: <CAFzgq-xNZmWrdwCDv3twdsqSWk-FyMuLYJjZ_bA42_5Po0mgEg@mail.gmail.com>

In many BIPs we have seen, include the latest BIP202, it is the block
time that determine the max block size. From from pool's point of
view, it cannot issue a job with a fixed ntime due to the existence of
ntime roll. It is hard to issue a job with the max block size unknown.
For developers, it is also easier to implement if max block size is a
function of block height instead of time. Block height is also much
more simple and elegant than time.
