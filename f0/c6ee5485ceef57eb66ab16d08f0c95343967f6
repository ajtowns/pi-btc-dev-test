Fully agree Pieter. Couldn't have stated it better.

It has been disappointing and scary to see political pressure tactics being used to change a distributed consensus system. 

By using the system everyone agreed on one set of consensus rules, that was the "social contract" of Bitcoin. To me, the consensus rules are more like rules of physics than laws. They cannot be changed willy-nilly according to needs of some groups, much less than lower gravity can be legislated to help the airline industry.

It is shocking to hear wide misunderstanding that it is supposedly 'the developers' that decide on such changes. As if this is merely a private top-down project. No, the point was that this can continue without any kind of central guidance, with expected stability. As a developer I work on improving the technical aspects and fixing bugs, not on 'governing' it.
By expecting a few developers to make controversial decisions you are breaking the expectations, as well as making life dangerous for those developers. I'll jump ship before being forced to merge an even remotely controversial hardfork.

The stressful conditions of last weeks have thus made me hostile toward the idea of hardforks. At least to hardforks that make politically loaded changes. In this case further centralization to well-connected geographic locales by increasing network bandwidth requirements.

Resiliency and decentralization are the key aspects. I would not want to risk breaking the system, or at least wildly changing its properties and applicability out of perceived necessity, and fear.
