btw if I got that right, it means you dont even have to fix the asn.1 level
ambiguity (though its a good idea to remove openSSL asn.1 parsing code) to
have conditional payments using not yet broadcast txid outputs as inputs to
work with high assurance.  (And even in the event that a new crypto level
malleability is discovered in ECDSA it remains secure.)
