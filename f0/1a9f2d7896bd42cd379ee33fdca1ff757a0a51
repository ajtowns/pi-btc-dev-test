All miners should validate transactions precisely because of the latest
attack you've described. Full miners can gain a lot from this attack to
leverage their full validation against spv miners who blindly spend energy
hashing on top of something that may be worthless crap. SPV mining makes no
sense, but some miners claim they're doind it for very short periods of
time, which shouldn't be as bad as doing it all the time.

I think it would be more rational for them to keep mining on top of the old
block until they've fully validated the new block (which shouldn't take so
long anyway), even if this slightly increases the orphan rate.
