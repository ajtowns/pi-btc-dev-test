If people split their bitcoins in multiple addresses, then maybe there
would be no need to worry(?), because the computational cost would be
higher than what the attacker would get.

*Here are some numbers that give a sense of how large scale this
computation was: *

   - *Nine quintillion (9,223,372,036,854,775,808) SHA1 computations in
   total*
   - *6,500 years of CPU computation to complete the attack first phase*
   - *110 years of GPU computation to complete the second phase*
