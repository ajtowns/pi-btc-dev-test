Again, you forget that there may exist miners for which the value of the coin
is negative.

Never mind that in practice you want there to exist a cost to encourage miners
to actually pay attention to what they mind and to encourage them to update
software when required and participate.

Validating clients, not SPV clients.

All those things simply change the amount of alt-coin the miner gets, which to
the miner may have no reward. You also have the issue that we may be talking
about a non-currency chain where reward is more nebulous.

In any case, regarding a zerocoin chain, Peter's observation that
proof-of-sacrifice allows a strong 51% attck defense is very clever and IMO is
significantly stronger than proof-of-work mining, merged or not, would provide.
It's essentially the ability to conjur up mining capacity on demand, but only
by those who have a stake in the crypto-coin. It does depend on the existance
of a proof-of-work chain, but we have a perfectly good one handy.
