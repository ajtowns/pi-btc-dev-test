This scheme would mostly be beneficial to end users of instant exchange wallets and would be implemented by the operators. None of the parameters would be filled up by the user by hand. It's more of enabling different wallet operators to communicate with each other and to be able to present to their end users the rates they are getting when sending from their pegged wallet to another pegged wallet. Abstracting bitcoin rates from both end users.?




To illustrate, imagine Alice who has a USD wallet wants to send JPY 10,000 to Bob who has a JPY pegged wallet.?




Alice's wallet scans Bob's wallet which tells Alice's wallet the following info:

1. Bob's BTC address

2. Bob's wallet currency is JPY

3. Bob's wallet operator is pricing BTC 1 at JPY?27,779 for the next 5 minutes.?





With these info, Alice's wallet can already derive the following:





Alice needs to send?0.35998416 BTC to send JPY 10,000. Alice's wallet can also show how much?0.35998416 BTC is in USD, which is USD 83.27. Alice's wallet can present it as follows;





"You are sending JPY 10,000 for USD 83.27 to Bob's wallet."
