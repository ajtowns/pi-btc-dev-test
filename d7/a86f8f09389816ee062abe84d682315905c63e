I'm not sure if a BIP is the right thing in that case, given that the
provided functionality is not special to Bitcoin and can be used in
other contexts as well. 

But ignoring this, the server should be authenticated at a
minimum.?Otherwise manipulating exchange rates seems to be a nice
way?for the attacker on the wire to make money...

Apart from that, my feeling is that it could be simplified. Is?
longpolling useful? And is the historical rate thing really necessary
for typical applications?

If yes, the client should be allowed to decide on which time scale the
data should be. (tick, min, hour, day, ...) That goes together with
clearly defining the type field (something like low, high, open, close,
but without flexibility). Think of a candle-stick chart basically.

Also, pushing may be more appropriate for "current" rates than polling.
Then no polling interval is necessary. On the other hand, this adds
complexity in other places, e.g., state.
