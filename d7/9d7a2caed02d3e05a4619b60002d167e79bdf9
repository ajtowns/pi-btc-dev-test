In chains where no timejacking attack is going on, yes. In the common case
the timestamp is limited to a range of [5 blocks in the past ... 2 hours in
the future].

However, during a timejacking attack, the timestamps of multiple-of-2016 blocks
are essentially independent from the others. In such a case, most timestamps are
very low, and only those of multiple-of-2016-blocks correspond to the current time.
Each 2016*N-1 to 2016*N transition incurs an arbitrary large forward shift to the
present time, each 2016*N to 2016*N+1 transition does a time shift backwards again
that is allowed because the median allows single outliers. By fixing the timestamp
occasionally more tightly to the maximum, instead of the median, no such time
lapses are possible.

Updated proposed rule: limit the timestamp of multiple-of-2016-blocks to
[max(past 11 timestamps)+1 ... current_time+7200], essentially just using a maximum
instead of a median. I believe that is enough to prevent the attack.
