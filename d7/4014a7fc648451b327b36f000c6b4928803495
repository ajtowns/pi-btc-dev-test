Hello,

I haven't heard anything about Peter Todd's tree chain idea 
(https://letstalkbitcoin.com/ltb104-tree-chains-with-peter-todd/) in a 
while. Is there some reason it has dropped from discussion? Was there 
some major flaw discovered? It seemed like it would be an additional 
technology actively discussed as an alternative to raising the block size.
