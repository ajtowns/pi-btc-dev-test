If software is using the DNS seeds in a way where one or two being
unavailable is problematic, then the software may be using them
poorly.

Generally DNS seeds should only be used as fast connectivity hints,
primarily for initial connectivity. Relying on them exclusively
increases isolation vulnerabilities (e.g. because the dns seed
operators or any ISP or network attacker on the path between you and
the seeds can replace the results with ones that isolate you on a
bogus network).
