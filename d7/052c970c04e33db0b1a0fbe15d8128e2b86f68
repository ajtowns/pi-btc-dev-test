Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin v0.3.23 released
Message-ID: <BANLkTim1FP5t=4erKYeomB011WPo4xshow@mail.gmail.com>

Win32, Linux and source releases (MacOSX soon) for bitcoin v0.3.23
have been uploaded to
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.23/

This is another quick bugfix release, trying to deal with the influx
of new bitcoin users.

Priority for next version:  wallet encryption

Main items of note:

    * P2P connect-to-node logic changed to reduce timeout a bit.  The
network saw a huge influx of new users, who do not permit incoming
connections.  This change is a short-term hack, to more quickly hunt
for useful P2P connections.  Better "leaf node" logic is in the works,
but this should let us limp along until then.
    * Transaction fee reduced to 0.0005 for new transactions (see note below)
    * Client will relay transactions with fees as low as 0.0001 BTC
(see note below)


NOTE:  There has been some fee confusion recently.  Free transactions
are supported and relayed as they always have been, according to
special anti-spam rules.  See
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees for details.

There were no changes between -rc1 and -final.  Wanted to get this out
ASAP, and move on to wallet crypto.
