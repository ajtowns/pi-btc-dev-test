That is not true, unless you are using a definition of the word
"decentralized" which is so broad as to convey no information whatsoever.

Saying that Bitcoin's security depends on decentralization is like
saying that a bridge's structural integrity depends on good materials.

Statements like that convey zero relevant information. Potential users
of a bridge want to know about the maximum working load of the bridge,
and under which conditions it is safe to use. At what wind speed should
the bridge be closed? Is it ok to keep using it after a magnitude 4
earthquake, or should it be closed for inspection?

Repeatedly asserting that bridges need to be made of good materials as
an alternative to answering those kinds of questions would be easily
recognized as useless in that context, but for some reason people seem
to accept it in this one.
