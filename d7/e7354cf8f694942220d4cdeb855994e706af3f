Subject: [bitcoin-dev]  [BIP Draft] Decentralized Improvement Proposals
Message-ID: <1451493317.3215816.479282618.4F666D71@webmail.messagingengine.com>

In an attempt to reduce developer centralization, and to reduce the risk
of forks introduced by implementation other than bitcoin-core, I have
drafted a BIP to support changes to the protocol from different
implementations.

The BIP can be found at:
https://github.com/tomasvdw/bips/blob/master/decentralized-improvement-proposals.mediawiki

I believe this BIP could mitigate the risk of forks, and decentralize
the development of the protocol.

If you consider the proposal worthy of discussion, please assign a
BIP-number.

Regards,
Tomas van der Wansem
