This is an interesting point.

If you have a precise description why it makes an incentive to make
blocks smaller I would love to read it.
Somebody asked and I didn't have an answer.
I imagine you try several reorderings sometimes excluding certain
branches of the merkle tree, permuting the branches you exclude or
something similar, but I really don't know the algorithm in detail and
I didn't want to say something inaccurate.
