You may see much better throughput if you run a few servers around the
globe and test based on closest-by-geoip. TCP throughput is rather
significantly effected by latency, though I'm not really sure what you
should be testing here, ideally.

Specifically this is an attempt to prove or disprove the common statement that 1MB blocks were only suitable slower internet connections in 2009 when Bitcoin launched, and that connection speeds have improved to the point of obviously supporting larger blocks.

If the bar for suitability is placed at taking only 1% of the block time (6 seconds) to upload one block to one peer, then 69% of the network fails for 20MB blocks. For comparison, only 10% fail this metric for 1MB blocks.
