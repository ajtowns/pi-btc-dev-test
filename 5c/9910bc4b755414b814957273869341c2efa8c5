They have been, resulting in a replacement called "getblocktemplate"
which (presumably) almost everyone talking to bitcoin(d|-qt) has been
using for a long time.

I think removing the ability to mine in the stock package would be
regrettable, but to be honest we already don't have it for the
mainnet. I think we should do as Jeff suggests and remove getwork. But
I think we should also package along a proper getblocktemplate miner
to remove any doubt that we're providing a full network node here.  (I
note that the choice of miner is also easy:  Regardless of people's
preferences which way or another, AFAIK only luke's bfgminer stuff can
mine directly against bitcoin getblocktemplate with no pool in the
middle.  It also supports a huge variety of hardware, and a superset
of our target platforms)
