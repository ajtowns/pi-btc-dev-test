But according to Alex's explanation (which I think is very good
leaving asides some cases like change of the pow hashing function, for
example) there's no individual that can force or veto a change. It is
the decision of each individual user and their own "pretty much
everybody" may vary. But this "pretty much everybody" is what Mark
referred to with the "I know it when I see it."

If you recommend users to apply changes when this criterion is met but
you know there's still many users who don't agree with the change,
then you're acting irresponsibly by promoting a chaotic consensus fork
where coins can be spent in both chains at once.
Well...unless you're promoting it as an altcoin that simply happens to
distribute part of the initial monetary based to bitcoin holders at
block X and whose genesis block is equal to bitcoin's genesis block at
block X. I guess in that case you wouldn't necessarily be
irresponsible.
"Miner's vote" is irrelevant here since it cannot tell you anything
about users adoption (besides miner's adoption of course).

But this is only relevant for the point 1. Software projects can have
dictators, forks and everything else other free software projects
have. But consensus-based p2p blockchains cannot change their rules in
the same way, otherwise they're centralized.

THERE CANNOT BE A VOTING PROCESS FOR CONSENSUS CHANGES.
If anybody can vote, hod do you prevent the sibyls from outvoting everyone?
If not everybody can vote, how is the voters' list determined without
centralizing the system?
If we had a technical solution to this problem we wouldn't need proof
of work in the first place!!
