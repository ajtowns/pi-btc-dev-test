I was inclined towards the shortest possible encoding, even just a single
letter "a", mainly to reduce the amount of bytes required to form a QR
code.That said, "address" is more self-explanatory. Perhaps I will include
some sample QR code sizes for typical use cases, and see if it stays
reasonable.

As multiple keys of the same name would not be supported easily in many
wallets, a delimited is probably preferable.

I will update the BIP proposal and send it again.
