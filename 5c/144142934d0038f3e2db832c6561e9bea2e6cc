In the last 2016 blocks, as I write this, there are only 35 1 txn blocks.

This is about 1.73%, which wouldn't be surprising just from timing
alone.  Moreover, a fair amount (I didn't measure the percentage)
appear to be mined by Eligius? Luke does some clever pre-computation
of the hash tree for faster distribution right after new blocks.

Resources expended on fancy (and potentially risky) techno-economic
hacks to discourage empty blocks would probably be better spent
writing very fast transaction tree generating code.

Can we kill this thread now?
