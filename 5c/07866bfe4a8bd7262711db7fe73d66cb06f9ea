Perhaps as a safeguard:
(3) Before applying the new rule, require 50% of the last Y blocks contain a
    coinbase with a "I am upgraded" code
(4) Until the new rule is active, include an "I am upgraded" code in every
    block; after it's active, this can be turned off

Why would legitimate community members ever intentionally transmit an invalid 
transaction? ;)
