As someone who has put a lot of thought into how to best help typical everyday people understand bitcoin, I strongly favor 1 bit = 1e-6 BTC as being very straightforward to explain to non technical types, and also XBT as one "bit".  "There are a million bits in a bit coin" is highly intelligible to average people. 

I consider overload/conflict with existing meanings of "bit" as a non-issue for typical population at large.
