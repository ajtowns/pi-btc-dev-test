I think in that case, you absolultely have to invalidate all the
transactions in the Payment message by broadcasting a send-to-self
transaction as soon as possible; until that point your wallet balance
is indeterminate.  Otherwise what will happen if the merchant did in
fact receive the Payment message, and then processes it (and
broadcasts the transaction) after some delay?

Then what the user will see is: an apparently failed attempt to pay,
leaving their wallet balance unchanged.  Then, perhaps many hours
later, their wallet balance will appear to spontaneously decrement.
