There's a simple way to cut down on "noise" that doesn't involve people
shouting OFFTOPIC at each other: the maintainer needs to resolve
discussions by making decisions and saying, this is how Core does it. If
you disagree, go make/join a fork because there's no point in discussing
this any further here. People would get the picture pretty fast.

Wladimir doesn't do this. That is something he should fix. Clearly ending
debates so they don't run in circles forever is a basic management
technique.

Allowing random people to give each other red cards is merely a great way
to piss off users even further, because anyone who objects to a clearly
bone-headed decision will be told they're discussing philosophy and to go
away (this is meaningless).
