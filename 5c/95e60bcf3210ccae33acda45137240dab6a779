Subject: [bitcoin-dev] CI Build for Bitcoin - Some Basic Questions about
	Gitian and other stuff
Message-ID: <CAAMhxnzWTNMQVcziTx9f4AYE0rvi8y2JKbYRF5t_ds4esx=Jkw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks.
I'm trying my hand at creating a reproducible build of my own for bitcoin
and bitcoin-XT, using TeamCity.
I believe it is the best way to learn something: To try to build it
yourself.
Here is what I think I know so far, and I would love corrections, plus
questions:

   1. Bitcoin is built continuously on travis-CI at
   https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/
   2.  there are many flavors that are built, but I'm not sure if all of
   them are actually used/necessary. are they all needed, or just to "just in
   case"?
   3.  There is a gitian build file for bitcoin, but is anyone actually
   using it? are the bin files on bitcoin.org taken from that? or the
   travis ci builds? or some other place?
   4. Are there any things that people would love to have in the build that
   do not exist there today? perhaps I can help with that?

Here is what I have now: http://btcdev.osherove.com:8111/
It does not do the matrix build yet, but it's coming. I'm just wondering if
all the platforms need to be supported,and if gitian is truly required to
be used, or used in parallel, or at all..

Feedback appreciated.
