I think you are conflating 3 different (though overlapping) groups:

1. Block header generators. These need 'good internet' meaning very low
latency, reasonable bandwidth, good place in network (e.g. FIBRE or mining
backbone). They need reliable computers with enough RAM and CPU to validate
prior blocks promptly and immediately assemble new blocks.

2. Hashers. These need cheap electricity, access to economical uses of
waste heat, cheap mining hardware. e.g. IOT electric water heater.

3. ASIC manufacturers. These need lots of capital, etc.

It might be helpful to keep these three groups distinct in your mind and
conversation, and to use the protocol as a crowbar to pry them into
separate people, or at a minimum make it economically possible to
participate in one role without needing to participate in the other two. If
different, geographically and politically dispersed groups are helping
perform these functions, it aids decentralization.
