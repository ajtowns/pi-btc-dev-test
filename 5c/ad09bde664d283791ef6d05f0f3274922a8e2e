Pieter built a nice simulation tool and posted some results.

I tweaked the parameters and ran the tool in a way that tested ONLY for 
hashrate centralization effects, and did not conflate these with network 
partitioning effects.

I found that small miners were not at all disadvantaged by large blocks.

The only person who commented on this result agreed with me.  He also 
complimented Pieter's insight (which is entirely appropriate since 
Pieter did the hard work of creating the tool).
