Hmmm?  When I asked YOU for that kind of security analysis document, you
said you'd see if any of your clients would be willing to let you publish
one you'd done in the past. Then I never heard back from you.

So, no, I don't have one for BIP 101, but unless you were lying and just
trying to add Yet Another Hoop for BIP 101 to jump through, you should
already have something to start from.

RE: mempool only: yes, pull-req 5000 satisfies (and that's what I was
thinking of). There should be a nice, readable blog post explaining to
other full node implementors and wallet implementors why that was done for
Core and what they should do to follow 'best practices to be soft-fork
ready.'
