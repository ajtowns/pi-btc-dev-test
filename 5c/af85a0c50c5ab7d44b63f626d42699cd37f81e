Another way to look at it: is the benefit of the bitcoin network 
providing this service sufficiently greater than the cost?

The main cost is that a reorganization has a chance of invalidating a 
payment made at or just before expiration (if the payment isn't early 
enough in the new chain).  Would that increase recommended confirmations 
above their current levels, which are centered around the possibility of 
a malicious double-spend?  Unclear to me.
