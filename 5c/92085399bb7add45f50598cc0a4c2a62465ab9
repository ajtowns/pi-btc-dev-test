How many downloads/day do we see currently? I think you said it's on the
order of a few thousand, so nowhere near 30k I'd guess. Anyway I can mirror
it if we need to.

The JavaFX packager is supposed to delete parts of the JVM that aren't
used. Is the 30-40mb figure based on using that tool or something else?
Note that you don't need to use the JFX widget toolkit to use the bundler
tool.

We could also invest in a copy of JET, which does native compilation down
to self contained Windows binaries. It might create smaller bundles. But,
it's a proprietary tool and I don't know how reproducible its outputs are.

For the auto update, is there an existing auto update framework that we can
modify to support threshold signed updates? I'm sure such a thing must
exist. The updates would download in the background and then the app can
just ask the user to restart it once the update is locally available, as
Chrome does.
