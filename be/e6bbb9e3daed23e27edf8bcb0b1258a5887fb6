As discussed, "reorg proof" it's a more appropriate term since the
reorg can happen without any fraud. It also prevents the term from
being confused with the fraud proof that auditors (full nodes that
can't create blocks) produce for private chains.

In this case you can't require a side chain proof of burn to move back
to the side chain or the funds could be locked by the dishonest
private chain operator (accountant in freimarkets[1] terminology). By
allowing unilateral withdrawals, you impose on the private chain the
task of observing the side chain looking for double-spends, censoring
those transactions or maybe updating its committed utxo when it has
proofs that the coins have been withdrawn.
