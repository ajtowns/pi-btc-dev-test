TLS is a huge complex attack surface, any use of it requires an
additional dependency with a large amount of difficult to audit code.
TLS is trivially DOS attacked and every major/widely used TLS
implementation has had multiple memory disclosure or remote execution
vulnerabilities even in just the last several years.

We've dodged several emergency scale vulnerabilities by not having TLS.
