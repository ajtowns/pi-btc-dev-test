agreed.

Zlib had a bad buffer overflow bug but that was in 2005 and it got a lot
of press at the time.  It's was fixed in version 1.2.3...we're on 1.2.8
now.  I'm not aware of any other current issues with zlib. Do you have a
citation?

agreed.

I don't think LZO will give as good compression here but I will do some
benchmarking when I can.
