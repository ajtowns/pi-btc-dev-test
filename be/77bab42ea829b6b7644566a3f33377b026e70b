You're talking about proof-of-stake here.

At best it's very difficult for such a "proof-of-burn" to _actually_ be a
proof, as the burn only happens if the consensus mechanism ultimately includes
that burn. Contrast that to proof-of-work's incredibly simple proof: you _know_
energy was destroyed to find a PoW solution, regardless of what consensus is
ultimately reached.

It's the difference between a computer secured from hackers with an anti-virus
scanner, and a computer secured by the fact that it's not connected to the
internet at all.
