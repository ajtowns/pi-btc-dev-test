I know I'm super-late to bring this up, but was there a reason Bech32 omitted 
the previously-discussed P2SH? improvements? Since deployment isn't too 
widespread yet, maybe it'd be worth a quick revision to add this?

For those unfamiliar with the concept, the idea is to have the address include 
the *single* SHA256 hash of the public key or script, rather than 
RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)) or SHA256(SHA256(script)). The sender would then 
perform the second hash to produce the output. Doing this would in the future 
enable relaying the "middle-hash" as a way to prove the final hash is in fact 
a hash itself, thereby proving it is not embedded data spam.

Bech32 seems like a huge missed opportunity to add this, since everyone will 
probably be upgrading to it at some point.
