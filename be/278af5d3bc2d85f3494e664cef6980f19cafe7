Bitcoin had an incredible year in 2013, and I very much enjoyed working
with and meeting you all.

I'm very much looking forward to some of the upgrades coming in 2014.
Though a lot happened in the general community, last year was kind of quiet
with respect to the core software. I'm hoping this year we can pick up the
pace a little.

Cheers!
