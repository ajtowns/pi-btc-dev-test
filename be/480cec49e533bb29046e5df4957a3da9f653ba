I'll add fuel to the fire here, and express that I believe that
replace-by-fee is good in the long-term.  Peter is not breaking the
zero-conf, it was already broken, and not admitting it creates a false
sense of security.  I don't want to see systems that are built on the
assumption that zero-conf tx are safe solely because it has always
appeared safe.  You can argue about rational miner behaviors all day,
but in a decentralized system you have no idea what miners consider
rational, or speculate about their incentives. 

If there's one thing I learned playing poker (many years ago), was that
always assuming your opponent is rational can lose you a lot of money. 
You made play that, in hindsight, was terrible given what he actually
had.  But you assumed no sane or rational person in his position would
make such a play so you discounted it in your decision-making process. 
You're "right" that his actions were terrible and irrational, but he
still won your money because you discounted his ability to make such a
"bad" play.  Here, you are speculating that an "opponent" uses the same
values/motivations/rationality as yourself, and then building systems
that depend on that being true.  Even if it "should" be true doesn't
mean that it is true and will remain that way.  And you will get burned
by it eventually.

The Bitcoin network achieves something that we didnt' think was possible
10 years ago:  a totally trustless, decentralized ledger.  The cost?  It
takes time for the decentralized network to reach consensus that
transactions "happened".  That is quite literally the trade-off that we
make: you can centralize things by putting a bank in the middle and
getting instant confirmation, or you decentralize and let the network
reach consensus over time without the central authority.   If you want
instant confirmations, you're going to need to add centralization
because Bitcoin never offered it.  I support efforts to dispel any such
myths as soon as possible and encourage building robust solutions
(payment channels, insured zero-conf services, etc.).

does, and there are incentives to use it by miners.  These are the
