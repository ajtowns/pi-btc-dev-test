We already have a good private HTTP interface.  Most benefits of this REST
interface come from exposing it publicly.  As always, the challenge is
balancing costs and benefits.  I'm not confident that either can be known
with certainty until a well-written prototype is running in the wild.  As
some nodes expose this interface, we'll gain concrete experience from which
node operators can make informed security trade offs.
