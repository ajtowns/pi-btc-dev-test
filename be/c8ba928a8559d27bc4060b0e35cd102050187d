So far I have not seen any reasonable name except for "bit". I also
tried to come up with something else (e.g.naka, toshi, etc.) to avoid
the confusion with bits used in computing, but I was not satisfied with
neither of them.

Then I though about "credit", which is more-or-less established in video
games and sci-fi literature and people are already used to sentences
like "Not enough credits" or "This item costs 10000 credits", because of
this. Also it would be particularly funny if these sci-fi pieces
predicted the future by actually defining it. ;-)

Another options might be "cubit" or "crebit", but the latter is
sometimes used as a compound word meaning both "credit" and "debit" such
as in "You can use crebit cards here".

Also this Wikipedia source is a list of sometimes rather funny
possibilites: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_currencies
