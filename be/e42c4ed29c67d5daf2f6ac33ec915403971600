+1s here means simpling say "+1" or "me too" that carries no additional
information.  ie. if you like an idea, that's great, but it's not worth
interruping the entire list for.

If you say "I prefer proposal X over Y because <reasons>" that's
different.  As is "I dislike X because <reasons>" or "I need X because
<reasons>".

Hope that clarifies!
Rusty.
