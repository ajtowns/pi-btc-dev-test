Would you consider software which scans all accounts as specified by
BIP64, but has no user interface option to distinguish them in any
way, view them independently, and has no ability to keep the coins
apart... compatible with BIP64?

According to the argument here mentioned earlier ("all or nothing"),
it is, as it will not break interoperability with other BIP64
software. Still, it doesn't support the accounts feature, and perhaps
that's fine?
