Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Status updates (including to Active/Final Status)
	- BIP 39, BIP 43, BIP 44, BIP 67, BIP 111, BIP 125, BIP 130
Message-ID: <201608232012.12588.luke@dashjr.org>

A number of BIPs seem ready for updating to Final Status. If there are no 
objections, I will update these in 2 weeks:

BIP 39: Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys
- Used by many wallets and hundreds of thousands of users.

BIP 44: Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets
- Appears to be implemented by multiple wallets.

BIP 67: Deterministic Pay-to-script-hash multi-signature addresses through
        public key sorting
- Implementations in multiple wallet software exist.

BIP 125: Opt-in Full Replace-by-Fee Signaling
- Implemented in Bitcoin Core and derivatives; appears to be in regular use on 
the network.

BIP 130: sendheaders message
- Implemented in Bitcoin Core and derivatives.

Also, BIP 43 (Purpose Field for Deterministic Wallets) is an informational BIP 
which appears to be guiding to some extent the creation of new BIPs; therefore 
I propose its Status be upgraded to Active. I will make this update in 2 weeks 
also, if no objections.

Additionally, BIP 111 (NODE_BLOOM service bit) has been implemented in Bitcoin 
Core and derivatives; it is unclear if used by clients yet. Can developers of 
such clients please comment and let me know: 1) if their software supports 
this BIP already; 2) if not, do they intend to support it in the future?
If and only if there are any clients using this service bit already, I will 
update BIP 111 to Final Status in 2 weeks also.

Thanks,

Luke
