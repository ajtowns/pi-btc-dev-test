It's always good to use an existing standard, but I remember SNMP,
even on a client device/application is pretty complex in itself.

And I suppose the registration for custom OIDs and such is kind of baroque.

I'm not entirely convinced of what the added value in this case would
be. Yes, there are tools for monitoring SNMP, but in my experience
those tools usually support other ways of collecting statistics as
well.
