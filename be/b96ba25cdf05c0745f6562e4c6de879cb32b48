Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal: Extended serialization format for

Thanks for the proposal. Aside from potential privacy implications of
revealing the derivation path for non BIP-44, 45, 49 HD nodes, this scheme
is superior to the alternate {x,y,z}pub idea. Since coin_type is part of
the path, the 'xpub' prefix may be shared across all coins if they so
choose. This format provides lock-in for BIP-49 going forward and opens the
door for a parallel native-SegWit BIP.

The birthday field is interesting. Could you provide some motivation for
its inclusion?

Could you also add some test vectors?

There are a few minor grammar / spelling errors, but we can nitpick those
after this goes to the pull request stage on bitcoin/bips.
