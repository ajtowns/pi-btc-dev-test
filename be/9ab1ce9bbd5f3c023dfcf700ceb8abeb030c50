You are absolutely right and this is something I have often unsuccessfully
tried to explain as "disruption strategies". The problem is that most
people in the technical community assume good faith at all times, which
plays right into the frame required for disruption.

However, I would like to challenge your assumption of point 1 that that by
Mike making a rabble, it somehow makes CLTV deployment controversial. His
arguments have  been refuted.

Mike has not presented anything convincing and history actually shows that
ISM works, and we have learned how to make it even more streamlined. We
know ISM has consensus because miners have accepted ISM for past softfork
rollouts.

Simply making a noise does not make something controversial. When it is
controversial, it is obvious and plain to see.
