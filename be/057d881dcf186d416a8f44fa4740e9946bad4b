Hey Greg,

It wasn't my intention to insult anyone (a bit defensive?).

Maybe this is yet another example of a recurring criticism of Core: that core doesn't community these issues very well to journalists / reports / media / community outside of this list.

Because outside of this list it's been all about those 148 coins, and almost zero mention of replay attacks.

Are there other, more reasonable / feasible ways of addressing replay attacks in Bitcoin / BIP149 scenario?

Cheers,
Greg
