Thanks for the proposal.

Three points it could see as possible improvements:

1.
>From what I know, the exact birthday in seconds doesn?t matter that much therefore it may be possible to just use 13 or 16bits to create a representation in week from 2009-01-09 00:00 UTC. 13bits would give you 157 years.
Always round down to the beginning of the week when the key was created.
But not sure if it?s worth to save ~two bytes for that.
Also not sure if the key-birthday in seconds could have a security or privacy implication (week maybe better).

2.
Would it make sense to have special depth bytes that directly implies it?s a BIP44 master key (and therefore avoid the bip32 path serialisation)? I know some ?centralised? table need to be available for that which may be not a good idea. But maybe the BIP could reserve a couple of depth-bytes (maybe 0xF0 to 0xFF) for predefined paths.

3.
Would adding a version bit make sense to allow future extensions?
