In a system like bitcoin, where the system has to keep running, you
have to consider how to roll out upgrades, and the costs associated
with that.
* the general cost of any network-wide change, versus P2SH which is
already analyzed by devs, rolled out and working
* the cost of P2SH output is predictable, versus less predictable outputs
* the cost of updating everybody to relay this new transaction type,
whereas P2SH Just Works already
* cost of increasing rate of UTXO growth versus P2SH
* "default public", versus P2SH's "default private"

It is true that publishing the script in the txout has the advantage
of being easily audited by third parties scanning the blockchain, but
in the interest of space efficiency you may accomplish the same thing
by offering the script upon request out-of-band.  The script is
hash-sealed by the P2SH address, enabling perfect proof.

Don't have a transcript handy, but these things are usually logged and
google-searchable.

In any case, it would be nice to get together and start building a
"cookbook" of useful scripts like the ones you've been describing.
The power of bitcoin scripts is only beginning to be explored.  Use
cases and examples are very helpful.
