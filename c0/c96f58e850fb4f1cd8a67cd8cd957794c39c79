The POW threshold could be dynamic.  The first weak-block that builds on a
new block could be forwarded with a smaller target.

This reduces  the window size until at least one weak block is propagated.

The change in threshold could be time based (for the first 30 seconds or
so).  This would cause a surge of traffic when a new block once a new block
has propagated, so perhaps not so good an idea.

If there is a transaction backlog, then miners could forward merkle
branches with transactions in the memory pool with a commitment in the
coinbase.
