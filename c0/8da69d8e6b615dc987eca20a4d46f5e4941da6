Is there a problem with sending unrecognized messages to nodes?   If we
create a new message type specifically asking for memory pool transactions,
and we broadcast it to all nodes that we are connected to, and none of them
respond, then either there are no tx in their memory pools, or they don't
recognize the message and ignore it.  Either way, you're not going to get
any extra information out of them.  If you really care, a simple ping can
identify whether they're still connected and should've responded (as Jeff
said).

As long as the older node won't cut you off for sending one unrecognized
request, it seems that you can get by fine without requiring that bit.  I
guess it depends on the utility of definitively identifying whether a node
supports the functionality.  I personally don't feel like it's critical,
especially considering that this is most useful only during the transient
period when it's not normal for nodes to support it yet.
