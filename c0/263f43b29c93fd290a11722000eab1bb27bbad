The bitcoin ecosystem is better off the more transactions are propogated
peer-to-peer than directly to miners. We want miners listening to the
network, not soliciting transactions directly from users. You whispering
your transactions to your miner-of-choice while I whisper to mine
contravenes a critical value-add of the peer-to-peer network in my opinion.
