Hi,

my main concern here is that
 -) every Bip<this-bip>-compatible wallet in the future will have to implement all (then probably) legacy derivation and tx schemes.
 -) it does not fail in a deterministic way, if I import a seed or xPriv/xPub across different capable wallets.
	It is more visible if one account has [no funds/does not show up] at all after an import than if something shows up but you need to make sure that the balance is what you might expect.
