For sure, although *usually* all kinds of odd-ball forms of compensation
can be turned into a dollar figure. :)

The thing is if a miner is mining a transaction, even in exchange for a
out-of-band fee if they succeed, they probably still have an incentive
to a: ask the sender to include enough of a fee that it propagates, and
b: broadcast it themselves to make sure it's in other nodes signature
caches so their blocks propagate fast. (esp. with by-txid-only relaying)

Anyway, in what circumstance would a customer want an exclusive contract
with a miner?
