This is not currently reasonable. Rolling extranonce is not efficient, and 
using it to generate work for 400+ GH/s worth of miners every new block 
(longpoll) can easily take seconds. Noncerange helps a little, but has poor 
support presently, and still requires an otherwise-unique work per 4 GH/s.
That only leaves pools with the time header to play with. Furthermore, within-
a-minute accuracy basically forces all miners to rollntime-- I'm not against 
this result, but it does mean many miners and pools will be left out in the 
cold.

Miners already have very limited area to mess around with block times.
My understanding of these attacks is that they somehow bypass the limitations 
in place.
