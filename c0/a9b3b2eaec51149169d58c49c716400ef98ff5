Then send a payment and, before it confirms, try to send another one. The wallet won't let you send the second payment. It'll say something like, "You need x.xxxxxx more bitcoins to make this payment." But if you wait for your first payment to confirm, then you'll be able to make the second payment.

I notice that outgoing payments never show as "Sent" until they appear in a block, presumably because the app never sees the transaction come in over any connection.
