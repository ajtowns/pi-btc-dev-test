If we have a problem with a UTXO set that is too large, seems like maybe
the fair way to approach it is to enforce a limit on the growth of the UTXO
set.

Miners would eventually be forced to generate blocks that are UTXO neutral
and would factor that into their algorithm for prioritizing transactions.
Users who wish to generate a lot of outputs would need to find a buddy with
lots of inputs to consolidate and create a tumble-bit with them. A market
would spring up that would charge people for creating UTXOs and pay them
for disposing of UTXOs.
