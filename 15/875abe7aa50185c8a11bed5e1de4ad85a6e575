With taproot, this actually saves a lot more than a few bytes. For each update, you will make 3 signatures. One is a SIGHASH_ALL spending the setup TXO with no locktime. One is a NOINPUT spending a previous update TXO with absolute locktime. One is a NOINPUT spending the latest update TXO with relative locktime. For the first and third signatures, you will just sign directly with the scriptPubKey, without revealing the hidden taproot script. The second signature will reveal the taproot script, but it is needed only when someone published an outdated update tx.
