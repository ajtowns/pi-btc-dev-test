I am fully in support of the plan laid out in "Capacity increases for the
bitcoin system".

This plan provides real benefit to the ecosystem in solving a number of
longstanding problems in bitcoin. It improves the scalability of bitcoin
considerably.

Furthermore it is time that we stop bikeshedding, start implementing, and
move forward, lest we lose more developers to the toxic atmosphere this
hard-fork debacle has created.
