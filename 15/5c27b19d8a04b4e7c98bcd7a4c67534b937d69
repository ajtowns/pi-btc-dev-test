When you assume you make an ass out of you and me. That page doesn't even exist in my router, I don't have 2wire. The router I have is the one everyone is getting from uverse.

Literally everything you said is incorrect. It is completely on topic as it pertains to Bitcoin Core functionality, 42 connections is nothing, and that's not how you fix it. If you're gonna call me out for being wrong at least be correct! I spent a lot of time fixing this and the info is useful cause this problem happens to a lot of people, so why obfuscate it with this nonsense. 

AT&T u-verse as it is now is near impossible for bitcoin nodes, 42 in the world is absolutely pathetic considering they are among the top 2 ISPs in the USA. Thanks for proving my point.

I've been trying to keep our discussion off-list because it is off-topic, but
you keep adding the list back on in your
replies.

Settings
> Firewall > Advanced Configuration > Outbound Protocol Control > All Other
Protocols

That's all you had to do.

another country? Cause that statement is utterly ridiculous given the fact there
are hundreds of millions of people using AT&T. I was simply sharing my knowledge
on this issue since it poses a threat to the health of the bitcoin network, no
need for personal attacks.

these details with AT&T technicians or I wouldn't be saying them.
