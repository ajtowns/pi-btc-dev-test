I know, everyone knows.

There is a lot of work that needs to be done to be able to use bitcoind at an 
forever growing backlog. And since I've been doing software for some decades, 
I can tell you this won't be done or fixed in 6-12 months.
We probably haven't found the majority of the issues yet.

We need more time and a bigger blocksize gives us more time.
