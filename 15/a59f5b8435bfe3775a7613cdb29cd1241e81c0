We are talking about money here. Decisions in this project are
not made based on 'merit', they are made based on ROI. If killing
the project is more profitable, many of the actors involved are
obligated to their shareholders to attempt to kill the project.

Or maybe in this case, they might be obligated to their investors
to attempt to try to run all the competing miners out of business
and acquire a majority stake in the hashpower.

If Merit were actually important, I would hope we would be
talking about a way to finance development in a way that provides
real financial incentives for merit, rather than what appear to
be some perverse incentives that seem to be rewarding short-term
traders, conflict, and further consolidation of mining and 
exchanges.

The other problem with merit is there are just about as many ideas
about what has merit as there are people judging the merit of the
project.

For instance, I think demurrage and increasing the money supply are
ideas with more merit, but those ideas are not profitable to existing
bitcoin investors, and thus are not seriously discussed.
