If you simply redefine a range of unused nLockTime as nKillTime, users 
will be constrained to use either nLockTime or nKillTime, but not both 
in the same tx.

If we are willing to scarify a large range of tx nVersion, say 
10-15bits, the nKillTime data could be embedded there.

Another option is nSequence, which will allow per-input nKillTime and 
nLockTime.

The cleanest way, of course, is a hardfork to add a new nKillTime field 
to the tx so people could use nLockTime and nKillTime in parallel.
