It is correct to view first-seen miner and relay policy as
honour-based, though it is the current default.

I think it would be better to deploy full-RBF in an opt-in way and
leave the current default miner & relay policies as is.  So for
example a new signature flag or transaction type that is marked as
opting-in waiving the first-seen policy.

In this way we can get a smoother transition for people away from the
first-seen assumption, towards greenaddress (trust based) and
lightning / payment channel solutions.  Mid-term the channel and hub
model can provide fast secure 0-confirm transactions, which are
generically not known to be directly and robustly securable via miner
consensus.

As we've seen abruptly stopping the first-seen miner & relay policy is
risky and unpopular and causes people to seek contracts with miners to
retain first-seen.  This is itself a bad trend for fungibility for
obvious reasons.

We shouldn't prejudge people's and segment's of business weak-reliance
on first-seen.  Some types of payments are generally high trust (known
relationships) or physical stores or very low marginal cost (coffee
marginal cost <10c, sale price > $2 or lower ebook, audio stream etc
as embodied by fremium model).  It is not ours to prejudge and kill
their business.  It our job to help improve network security however,
so that they do not have to eat a fraud cost.  And that is do able
with trust via greenaddress, or without trust (other than
time-preference) via the hub & channel model.

Security maybe incrementally improvable via non-spendable relaying of
proof of double-spent status, and services that try to measure % of
miners by hashrate with assumption of first-seen that have have seen a
given transaction first, though I am not sure such approaches are
robust enough to invest time in vs greenaddress or hub & channel.

Any thoughts on the simplest way to support an opt-in version of full-RBF?
