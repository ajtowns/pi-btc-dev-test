>We should have the highest respect for what these people are doing, and we should try to do something constructive, not waste time with anger and disrespect.

Why, exactly, should I have any respect for what these people are doing (and supposedly not have any respect for what the other side is doing)?

>From my point of view, the XT side _does_ something constructive. It's the Core side that resorts to dirty tactics and tries to sabotage community's free choice instead.


>Nobody should be forced to do anything.

Great, so how about you go tell theymos to stop censoring XT posts and banning the other side on /r/Bitcoin?

Let users decide what Bitcoin is or isn't.


>The developers are not telling you what to do, they are trying to do what they consider is best for the ecosystem given their technical abilities.

The developers & Co are doing their best to stay in power, so they could continue imposing their will on Bitcoin ecosystem. This is the real power grab, not Gavin and Hearn, who merely provided an alternative.

And the fear they show is most telling.
