slush, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that's the only reason:
They want to generate a seed by combining entropy from the trezor device 
and from the user's computer;
In addition, they want the computer to be able to check that the seed 
actually was derived from the entropy it provided, using only a master 
public key (the computer does not have access to the seed)

This is why they designed bip39 that way.

I think the new bip39 proposal could be used in Electrum as an option 
for trezor, but I am reluctant to make it default, because it imposes 
its own dictionary.
