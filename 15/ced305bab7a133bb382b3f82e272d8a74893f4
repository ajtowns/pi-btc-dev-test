It looks like my draft hasn't been approved by the mailing list so if
anyone would like to read it it's also on Gist:

https://gist.github.com/toby/9e71811d387923a71a53

Luke - As stated in the Github thread, I totally understand where you're
coming from but the fact is people *will* encode data on the blockchain
using worse methods. For all of the reasons that OP_RETURN was a good idea
in the first place, it's a good idea to support it in PaymentRequests.

As for keyless - there's no way (that I know of) to construct a transaction
with a zero value OP_RETURN in an environment without keys since the
Payment Protocol is what defines the method for getting a transaction from
a server to a wallet. You can make a custom transaction and execute it in
the same application but without Payments there's no way to move
transactions between two applications. You need to build the transaction
where you execute it and thus need a key.
