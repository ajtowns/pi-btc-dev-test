Look, if we?re going to declare something an emergency, we cannot on the one hand say things like: "I strongly believe bitcoin has no place in the world if the fee raise much higher than a few cents per typically-sized transaction?, and on the other declare that there is an emergency worth redefining what *Bitcoin is* because the average txn fee is on the order of 7 cents [1] and has remained reasonable for some time [2].

If you?d like to understand what a qualifying emergency looks like, read the links:

In terms of scaling, we are nowhere close to an emergency.

Scaling is priority #4, maybe, and it?s being taken care of.

Meanwhile, we should be directing our attention one the more pressing and serious concerns like mining centralization & privacy.

Mining centralization is a serious issue. It is *not cool* that 4 dudes (and 1 government) have the power to redefine what Bitcoin is *right now*.

Relevant post with suggestions for fixing that:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/44kwf0/the_hardfork_that_bitcoin_really_needs_not/czrh3na

As far as I can tell, P2Pool & GBT are not the same thing, but I?ve been told that P2Pool might use GBT in some way, even though it?s listed on the wiki as not using it. [3]

A hard fork would ideally enforce decentralized mining pools somehow so that transaction selection is done at the edges instead of the center.

Cheers,
Greg
