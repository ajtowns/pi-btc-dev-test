Great to hear from you!

Yeah, I'm pretty surprised myself that Gavin never accepted the
compromises offered by others in this space for a slow growth solution,
rather than starting with over an order of magnitude blocksize increase.
This is particularly surprising when his own calculations - after
correcting an artithmetic error - came up with 8MB blocks rather than
20MB.

Something important to note in Gavin Andresen's analysises of this issue
is that he's using quite optimistic scenarios for how nodes are
connected to each other. For instance, assuming that connections between
miners are direct is a very optimistic assumption that depends on a
permissive, unregulated, environment where miners co-operate with each
other - obviously that's easily subject to change! Better block
broadcasting logic helps this in the "co-operation" case, but there's
not much it can do in the worst-case.


Unrelated: feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions
re: the BIP66 upgrade; I hear you guys were planning on upgrading your
mining nodes soon.
