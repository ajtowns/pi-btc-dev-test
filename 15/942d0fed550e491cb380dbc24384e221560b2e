I proposed this as a means of giving a mechanism for wallets to get
non-sybilled peers as well.

Doing so encourages pools to only bother connecting to other pools,
which is a strong centralizing force. But given the nasty incentives
present anyway - it's in your advantage to distribute your blocks to no
more than a majority of hashing power if you can do so consistently -
I'm unconvinced that this won't happen anyway.

The maximal benefit would be if two sets of addresses were published:
public and private. The issue with publishing addresses is DoS attacks,
but publishing Tor addresses doesn't stop attacks. What would discourage
attacks however would be to encrypt that data such that only the
creators of specific prior blocks could decrypt it. This limits the
audience to those with incentives not to commit a DoS attack. (DoS
attack the IP, and you'll no longer get preferential peering)

Say what you want about centralization, but for the pools involved it's
a good idea.


On a technical level, the coinbase is limited in size, and people use it
for other purposes, so lets define a standard where this data is stored
in an OP_RETURN txout of the form:

OP_RETURN <key> <value> <key> <value> ...

Multiple values with the same key should be allowed. This data should be
placed in the last txout so that SPV nodes can eventually be given it
with a SHA256 midstate.
