Except for the fact that such a party is a DOS attack on the network
which is already short on functioning listeners.  I don't have much
doubt that people doing the "connect to everyone" are already causing
harm. There are some nodes in .ru/.ua which aggressively connect to me
(instant reconnects if I hang up on them) which have never passed me a
transaction in all my available logs.

Alerts scale better? both can have a place in the ecosystem, they're
actually complementary: Alerts are vulnerable to filtering by sibyl
attackers but they have deeper network penetration and where filtering
doesn't prevent them you don't need a connection to hear them.
