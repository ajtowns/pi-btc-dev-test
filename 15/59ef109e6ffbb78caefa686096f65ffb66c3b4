Yes, those trackers would be hard coded, just like the IRC servers and
channels are hardcoded right now.

The advantages over IRC and DNS Seeds are:
 - sporadic HTTP requests to a tracker, as opposed to keeping an IRC
connection open at all times
 - no virus/botnet like behaviour (automatically join IRC channel with
cryptic name), ISPs tend to bother network admins (like myself) with alerts
when they see this...
 - adapts faster than DNS Seeds which require configuration changes on seed
should the nodes become unreachable
 - we already use HTTP to determine our external IP, so it would be a
consolidation of transports
 - more peers than DNS Seeds (better load balancing)

As for Vladimirs proposal, seems like an extreme measure, that is not really
practical. Also it leads to network partitions since nodes will prefer their
own /8 and /16 networks. IPv6 will also soon be a problem for this method.
