Thanks; I've received several suggestions for other metrics to collect that I hope to implement soon, but you're right in that tracking per-peer pings is a different type of metric than what I'm currently collecting. I actually noted the lack of pong messages in a post I made a few weeks ago: http://coinchomp.com/2014/04/27/peeking-hood-running-bitcoin-node/

Once I added metrics for sent messages, it validated my theory: my node has never sent a single ping request to a peer and thus has never received a pong message. I can't even add sent pings or received pongs to this chart because they don't exist in my graphite instance. http://statoshi.info:8080/render/?width=1548&height=883&_salt=1400066995.622&target=stats.message.received.ping&target=stats.message.sent.pong&lineMode=connected&bgcolor=000000&fgcolor=FFFFFF

I guess my question regarding ping stats is how useful that information would be - it seems to me that if we are trying to quantify the cohesiveness of the network, we should instead be observing the message propagation times. Though that's outside the scope of my project; there are other people who are doing just that.

The problem with fitting that information into the current design is that the graphs seem to be comprised of overall statistics for this node, not per-peer statistics that can vary between peers (such as ping time).  If a line were to be added to a graph to represent each peer's ping time, the number of lines (statistics) on the graph would have to vary in real time as peers are added or removed, which would be a challenge.

So, something would have to send the "ping" RPC command on a regular schedule, to ensure the graph is updated with new information.  Also, there is currently no support for overlapping pings (although that would be easy to add), so if a peer is slow enough to not respond at all to the first ping request, and a second ping request goes out in the meantime, any late response from the first ping request would then be discarded.
