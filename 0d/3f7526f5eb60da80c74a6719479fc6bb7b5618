Subject: [Bitcoin-development] New webpage:  Offline Backups
Message-ID: <514B61EB.8060201@gmail.com>

I noticed the new webpage is up on bitcoin.org.   I still have mixed
feelings about it, but I noticed there is a "You need to know!" section
that suggests offline backups.

As long as you are featuring Armory and Electrum on the "wallets" page,
you should be including them in that blurb as options for offline
storage.  It's kind of silly to say "/You must do this!  But we have no
recommendations for how.  At all.  Good luck/!"  At least have a
dedicated page or (not-ideally, forum post) describing the various
options and leads for them to follow for actually doing it.
