It also wouldn't work. A bit is not enough to find an external service
except in the naive case where the advertised service would have a
fixed port. Not even bitcoind has a fixed port. So there needs to be a
mechanism to find how to connect to the 'external service'. This is
provided by the proposed extension.

It would in principle be possible to advertise an extra service bit
*in addition to* this one, to make it easier to find through the addr
mechanism. But it  would be confusing and IMO an abuse of P2P service
bits.
