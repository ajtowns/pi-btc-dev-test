What happens if the stake winner disappears? It seems, in your scheme, that
this would cause progress to come to a screeching halt.

Can we not nest mainstake outputs in p2wsh/p2sh scripts to mitigate this?
This means that they cannot block the creation of mainstake utxos -- but I
guess they would still be able to block the spends of this utxo.

Another thing that is problematic with using a p2sh output is 'relocking'
the stake. Unfortunately if the p2sh script hash's aren't identical I don't
think we can guarantee they didn't spend the stake to a non stake output.
If the script hash's *are* identical then the miner can censor the
transaction that re-locks the output.

Perhaps there is a hybrid that would work, however it depends on what you
mean by 'creation'. If it is just the *initial* creation of the utxo -- and
not subsequent OP_STAKEVERIFY change outputs -- I think this strategy might
work. You just won't be able to participate in the lottery while the utxo
is nested inside the p2sh output initially.

This also brings back the problem above -- what if a stake winner
disappears -- or a miners creates the illusion they disappeared via
censorship? I guess a miner would be losing out on transaction fees.
