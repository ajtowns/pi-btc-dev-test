If a miner try to hurt the network mining just empty blocks at some time the rest will start rejecting their blocks and will be orphans so will loss the reward incentive and that miner will join the behavior of the rest of the miners, if that miner has 51% of hashrate there the smallest problem are the empty blocks.

This would encourage miners to make their own tiny junk transactions to fill up their blocks, perhaps leaving larger, more space-efficient transactions in the mempool.

"Good" miners should probably build upon the block with a set of transactions more similar to what they themselves would include based on their mempool at the time.  However, miners don't have an incentive to do so today.  Instead, they may be better off building upon the block that leaves the most valuable transactions in the mempool, e.g. a small or empty block, and maybe leave some valuable transactions in the mempool for the next miner.[1]  This issue could possibly be addressed by a soft-fork that requires miners to pay a portion of their fees to future miners.
