Bitcoin is only a partial solution to the Byzantine general problem. 
Users do need to trust that things such as mining and development 
systems work as intended.  Once the user trusts those systems only then 
is the state of the ledger trustless.  Just because the state of ledger 
is decentralized due to mining that does not automatically mean 
everything associated with Bitcoin is "decentralized."  (Some people 
actually claim reddit is decentralized because users can vote.  That 
would mean the US government is also decentralized since there are 
elections but i don't think most people would agree with that definition.)

Centralized and decentralized system are not intrinsically good or bad. 
  Each one has it use cases just like a hammer and a screw driver. 
Claiming otherwise is treating Bitcoin a as religion rather than a 
technology.
