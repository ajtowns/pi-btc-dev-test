Indeed, their code previously did not increase the blocksize but it
was adjusted at the last minute to do so-- so it may actually do that
now. Because they don't appear to have implemented any tests for it, I
wouldn't be too surprised if it still didn't work at all but also
wouldn't be surprised if it did.

You are correct that the specification text appears to refer to the
prior change that did not. (In my response I just assumed that it
meant what they actually did-- good catch).
