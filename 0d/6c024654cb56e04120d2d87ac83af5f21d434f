Yes.  The tradeoff is implementation complexity: it is trivial to check
transaction size,
not as trivial to count signature operations, because
number-of-bytes-in-transaction
doesn't require any context.

But I would REALLY hate myself if in ten years a future version of me was
struggling to
get consensus to move away from some stupid 100,000 byte transaction size
limit
I imposed to mitigate a potential DoS attack.

So I agree, a limit on sigops is the right way to go. And if that is being
changed,
might as well accurately count exactly how many sigops a transaction
actually
requires to be validated...
