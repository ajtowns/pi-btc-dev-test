Eligius has contracts to do transaction mining, and it's currently 10%
of the hashing power.

As I said elsewhere, a good use-case for OOB fee payment is for
merchants who use the payment protocol, and want to get their customers
transactions mined as efficiently and cheaply as possible.
(child-pays-for-parent has more blockchain bloat and thus extra expense)

Sure, but even then there's no harm in letting more than one miner know
about it.

There's even an existing form of this: P2Pool lets shares be accompanied
by up to 50KB worth of transactions of any form.
