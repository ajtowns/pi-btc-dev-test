This is the critical confusion about Bitcoin decentralization, which leads to this whole recent mess of shouting at each other.

Decentralization is _not_ a way to withstand an attack, if the government "goes after you".

Many people got this idea drilled into their heads in the previous years, that Bitcoin is a "movement" to fight governments, and decentralization is its main weapon.

They confuse Bitcoin and Anonymous.

Absolutely. Nobody argues that we shouldn't care about decentralization.

But who's gonna pay for all this? What are the incentives?

We need Bitcoin to get much more popular for this to happen.
