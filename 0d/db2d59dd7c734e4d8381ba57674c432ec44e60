Regarding "basic fraud detecting mechanism" of which you speak, being
as I personally enjoy SPV for the time being (Electrum), and I know
that people will continue to keep using SPV wallets because they are
light and handy, I think that you make a good point that "basic fraud
detecting mechanism" is needed, but how to verify that such a
mechanism in an SPV wallet is good, and/or that the software and
version information provided by the server admins via the banner is
valid (being as it's not validated)?  I have made a thread on this
conundrum.  Which is posted here if you are interested.

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1157545.0

So as to avoid repeating stuff please read whole thead before
answering in it or posting back to list.  It seems that there are
definitely unanswered questions...

I may open this up as an issue on https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum
about this stuff, but I wanted to post comment here also, for the record
.
