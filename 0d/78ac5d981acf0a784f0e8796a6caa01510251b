It is *not proof of stake.* when:

a) burn happens regardless of whether you successfully mine.
b) miner cannot know which tx are burns
c) the majority of burns cannot be used for mining and are simply lost
(poisson discovery distribution)
d) burn involves real risk: *every bit as much at stake *

(It's the difference between a computer secured by not being connected to
the internet, and a computer secured by re-imaging from a computer that
was, in the past, not connected to the internet.)

It is possible to craft a burn-network such that the only way for a miner
to prevent a burn is to prevent all transactions other than his own.

This is still a weakness, and I can't see a way around it though.
