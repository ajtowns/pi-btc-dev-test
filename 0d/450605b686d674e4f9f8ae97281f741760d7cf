Tier ~

I don't think the XT author(s) are going to do what you are
describing.  Their recent release, at
https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/blob/0.11A/README.md
doesn't show any sign of moving toward a version which would be
"increasing consensus." Instead, they ignore any meaningful process
and, as I have recently indicated, have created somthing which
"sidetrack(s) real discussion necessary to resolve the issues so as to
achieve some level of consensus in block size debates."

That doesn't rule out that the BIP authors can't work together and
create something meaningful and useful, though.  As I stated before,

"In my past message(s), I've suggested that Jeff's BIP 100
is a better alternative to Gavin's proposal(s), but that I didn't
think that this should be taken to mean that I am saying one thing is
"superior" to Gavin's work, rather, I emphasized that Gavin work with
Jeff and Adam."

I am also looking forward to seeing some visualizations or graphs of
the miner votes going on right now on BIP 100 and BIP 101, for example.

Regarding XT, my statement is simple:

"Do not download this loathsome XT thing. Cast it back into the fires
from whence it came."
