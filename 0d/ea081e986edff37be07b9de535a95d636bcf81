A development list is a great place to decide how to implement a
technical feature, one that feature has been deemed desirable.

The chief scientist has a platform via which he can publicly announce
proposed protocol changes. Anyone else could do the same.

There are conference happening all the time where people can announce
ideas like this, to give time for the community to hear the idea and
generate feedback.

There is absolutely nothing so urgent about this attack that requires
the consensus process to start here, in a place that most Bitcoin
users don't even know about and wouldn't even know which search terms
to apply to look for such a discussion if they did.
