I tend to have this conversation a lot ;) I'm not sure what Aymeric has in
mind, but my suggestions are for use by the small few who properly
understand how these things work. I am not suggesting blockchain.info
require every user to choose a book passage to use as their backup phrase!

There are so many small things that could be done to make a text input
unique. Choose the X number of words from the start of the Nth sentence.
Replace all punctuation with exclamation points. Combine two sentences from
different pages. It would be nigh impossible to brute force any of these,
and would require hints/instructions from the owner to recover.

But I admit if this is not intended for standardization, discussing it on
this mailing list is probably unwarranted.
