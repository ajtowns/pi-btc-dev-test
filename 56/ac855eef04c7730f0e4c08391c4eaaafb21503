If we're going to consider doing this, at minimum we need to also
include a separate limit for how much the UTXO set can be grown by each
block, calculated as the size of the scriptPubKey + constant metadata.
(tx hash, index #, nValue, nVersion, nHeight should cover it)

A P2SH transaction txout would measure 71bytes under that model. Given
that we haven't even shown we can limit the creation of txouts that can
not be spent economically caution would dictate setting the UTXO growth
limit fairly low, say 1/4th of the block limit.
