FWIW, I had worked on something similar a while back: https://github.com/CodeShark/bitcoin/tree/coinparams_new/altconf <https://github.com/CodeShark/bitcoin/blob/coinparams_new/altconf/bitcoin.conf>

I like the idea in principle?but we should require a new genesis block, different magic bytes, and a different network port at the very least. :)
