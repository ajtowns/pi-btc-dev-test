All of this is already implemented in the bitcoind and bitcoin gui.

The theoretic minimum for the prune target would be 0 (just the header
of the current best block) as Bitcoin Core already stores the
chainstate (about 2 GiB) regardless of what you set for -prune=<N>.

In practice, the minimum is 510, so reorgs and small rescans (may not
be implemented in 0.12) are still possible.

The clients won't let you set it below that target:
"Prune configured below the minimum of 550 MiB. Please use a higher number."

Also, keep in mind Bitcoin Core comes with a help message explaining
-prune and other command line options
