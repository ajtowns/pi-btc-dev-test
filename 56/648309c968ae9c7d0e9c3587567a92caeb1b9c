And so far its been near impossible for those others to make distros not 
modify it.
Firefox is actually a good idea, it made debian stop distributing it.

Best solution is to build good relations with the packagers of distros.

ps. Linux distros distributing GPL licensed apps are required by law to offer 
the sources of the thing they build and distribute as binary. Which allows you 
to check the difference with upstream. Most distros therefore have a process in 
place for this. Even for not FLOSS software like bitcoin core.
