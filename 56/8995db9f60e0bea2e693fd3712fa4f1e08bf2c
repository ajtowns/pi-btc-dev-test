It's not clear to me what would be the reason for retaliation, given
there is no more harm in a miner purchasing a block than Coinbase
submitting enough transactions to fill a block. Both pay the market rate
for the space. But since the former results in a loss, a financial
consequence ("retaliation") is inherent.

If a farmer destroys his/her own apple crop he loses money. It may be
very conspicuous, but nobody would retaliate as only the farmer's own
property was affected. Customers would just get their apples elsewhere.
Block space created by a miner is property that belongs to the miner, it
can be sold or not sold.
