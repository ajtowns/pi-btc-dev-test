Note that "client supplied identification" is being pushed for AML/KYC
compliance, e.g. Netki's AML/KYC compliance product:

This is an extremely undesirable feature to be baking into standards given it's
negative impact on fungibility and privacy; we should not be adopting standards
with AML/KYC support, for much the same reasons that the W3C should not be
standardizing DRM.
