A lot of this discussion has already occured. Some code was even
merged into master, then reverted.

See:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4550
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4570

It would probably be a good idea to start from that code, as it
addresses many of the possible pitfalls you've been discussing.

A simple "double-spend alert" wouldn't work because it could be forged. But after there have been two attempts to spend the same output, no further transactions spending that same output should be relayed, in order to prevent flooding the network.
