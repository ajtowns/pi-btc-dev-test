...until the Bitcoin payment protocol showed up and let anyone with the
ability to MITM https turn that ability into untraceable cash.

I won't be at all surprised if one of the most valuable things to come
out of the payment protocol using the SSL PKI infrastructure is to give
us a good understanding of exactly how it's broken, and to give everyone
involved good reasons to fix it.

Even if the flaws of SSL PKI were exploited as a way to harm bitcoin by
governments and other large players - and SSL PKI remained unfixed - I'd
much rather have that solid evidence that it was broken than not.
