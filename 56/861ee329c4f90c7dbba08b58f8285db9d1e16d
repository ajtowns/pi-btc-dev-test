Hang on a sec, in 45 minutes you can download the entire chain from
the genesis block?

I have been doing extensive testing in this area and would love to
know what is special about your setup (I have never had the entire
chain in under 12 hours, infact it is normally closerto 24.) I have an
extensive setup of test machines, everything from e4300 to phenom2x6
to i5's.

as an example on an amd e-450 with 4gb ram, and approx 3gb/s internet
connection it took 2 hours to sync the last 5 days.

Maybe i am missing something important...

Any additional information that you could provide to help me with
testing would be really appreciated.

cheers,

steve
