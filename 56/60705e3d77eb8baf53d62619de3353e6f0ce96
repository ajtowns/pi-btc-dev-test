Good morning,

The stake winner is only valid for a specific mainchain block.  If the stake winner is unable to publish a sidechain header on that mainchain block, then the mainchain block contains no sidechain header.  On the next mainchain block, a new stake winner is selected based on the mainchain block header hash of the mainchain block containing no sidechain header, hopefully that will be a different mainstaker.  So the stake winner will only slow down the sidechain temporarily.

Basically, the time to the next mainchain block is the "timeout" that the stake winner has to publish its sidechain header.  If we assume that mainchain will operate continuously (because a massive lack of mainchain activity would imply the death of the mainchain anyway) then the sidechain only gets slowed down (no block) if the stake winner does not respond.  Presumably this will not happen if the sidechain has pending transactions, as the stake winner would "lose its winning ticket" if it was unable to respond in a timely manner and lose its opportunity to earn sidechain transaction fees.

If the stake winner has lost keys completely, then the stake has a lock time and after the lock time the stake will no longer be part of the stake lottery, so while it would slow down the sidechain until the lock time, after the lock time it will no longer have an effect.

A passive attack, where a mainstaker just stakes and resets the stake when its lock time arrives, but does not publish any sidechain headers, will slow down the sidechain, but the mainstaker could have been earning sidechain fees if it were participating honestly instead, so the passive mainstaker suffers opportunity cost.

The lottery needs to be executable by the mainchain fullnodes.  Thus the mainchain fullnodes need to be aware of which UTXOs are to be put in the lottery, not just the sidechain fullnodes.  This is why I use scriptPubKey, rather than P2SH redeemScript.  However, this does allow mainchain miners to be aware of which UTXOs are mainstakes also, and allows them to censor these transactions.

Yes, it prevents the lottery from including the UTXO.  As it is not in the lottery, it cannot be a stake winner and cannot publish a sidechain block header until the lock time, when it can now publish openly that it is a stake UTXO using scriptPubKey.  This makes OP_STAKEVERIFY work almost as much as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY when inside a redeemScript.

>This also brings back the problem above -- what if a stake winner disappears -- or a miners creates the illusion they disappeared via censorship? I
>guess a miner would be losing out on transaction fees.

Yes, although the mainchain transaction fees from publishing sidechain block headers will only be marginally higher than the prevailing fee rate of the block.  For a particular block, the stake winner has a monopoly (it is the only one allowed to publish a sidechain header for that block) and does not need to bid with other mainstakers, and can bid the minimum necessary just to get into the mainchain block.
