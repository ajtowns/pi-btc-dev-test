That's exactly our attitude. We realized that have a community-wide
agreement on the wordlist itself is simply imposible, so to reach at least
some consensus we split the proposal to two parts - one what is essential
to call itself a "bip39 compatible", i.e. converting the mnemonic to bip32
node and second which is optional, including our proposed wordlist, which
has some advanced features like checksums etc. Now it is up to client
developers to decide if they really insist on their superior wordlist or if
they'll implement checksums following the full specification.

Odds are no one will go that route.

At least Trezor and bitcoinj (Multibit) seems to be going in this way,
which is 100% of clients which expressed interest in bip39 :-).
