However my concern with something like that is that it doesn't regard the optimal economic equilibrium for tx fees/size---not that the current limit does either but the concern with an auto-adjusting size limit that ignores this  would be the potential to create unforeseen externalities for miners/users. Miners may decide it is more profitable to mine very small blocks to constrict supply and increase marginal fees and with how centralized mining is, where a dozen pools have 85% hashrate, a couple of pools could do this. Then on the other side, maybe the prisoner's dilemma would hold and all miners would have minrelaytxfee set at zero and users would push the blocks to larger and larger sizes causing higher and higher latency and network issues.
