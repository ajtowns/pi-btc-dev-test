IANA normally register ports with the principle of conservation in mind.
See section 7.2 of RFC6335 for more details.

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6335#section-7.2

8333 and 18333 are currently unassigned, which is good news.

Ideally it would be good to have two ports, one for the main net, and one
for the test net.  However, in light of conservation only one may be
granted.  The question as to whether traffic could be multiplexed over a
single port may be raised.

If a whole slew of alt coins also tried to reserve ports, I suspect that
may raise eyebrows.
