As far as I understand, the incentives Sergio suggests would work. So
we can assume that the pruned uncle blocks would still win their creators
at least partial revenue.

As for selfish mining - I'm not sure how GHOST affects it. I don't think it
does. The selfish miners just care about heaviest subtree rather than
longest chain. DECOR changes revenue collection significantly, so it
certainly affects selfish mining. I believe it changes the threshold at
which
selfish mining is profitable, but doesn't deter selfish mining completely:
Selfish miners can still cause others to reduce their revenue by having
them work on older blocks.
