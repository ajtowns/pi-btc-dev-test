Sergio Demian Lerner: Please confirm that you understand that:

The current SegWit being proposed comes bundled with an effective 2MB block size increase.

Are you proposing the remove this bundled policy change, and then have a different BIP that increases the block size? Not quite clear if you understand what the current proposal is.

Cheers,
Praxeology
