This is false,

a segwit transaction to the miner you describe is an "everyone can spend" 
transaction, and as such a miner that does not validate the segregated area 
in a post-segwit world will be able to create blocks that will not validate 
for segwit miners by including a transaction that spends a SW tx.

This would then lead to a chain-fork as the SW miners reject it and the non-
SW miners continue to mine on it.
