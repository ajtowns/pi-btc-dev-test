Thanks for your thoughts.

My proposal isn't perfect for sure. There's likely much better ways to do
it. But to be clear what I'm trying to solve is basically this:

Who makes high-level Bitcoin decisions? Miners, client devs, merchants, or
users? Let's set up a system where everyone has a say and clear acceptance
can be reached.

---

My motivation for writing this proposal is stated right at the start:
> "The current process for accepting a BIP is not clearly defined. While
BIP-0001 defines the process for writing and submitting a Bitcoin
Improvement Proposal to the community it does not specify the precise
method for which BIPs are considered accepted or rejected."

BIPs are considered "accepted" right now based on an undefined system,
quite honestly. Btc Drak: What's the system for accepting a BIP? Words like
"consensus" come up but they aren't defined. My goal is to define a system
that makes finding "consensus" (I like the word "acceptance" better) in a
clear and fair way.

I.e. what's broken?

* Being sure that a proposal is widely accepted or rejected
* Preventing deadlock (i.e. one person's weak objections preventing
acceptance)
* Receiving feedback from important segments like user groups,
merchants/exchanges, etc. in a systematic and clear way instead of going
and forth or having "oracles" on technical advisory boards.

> Yes the process is loose, but is it broken?

Yes/No. Work gets done with the current process. Work can get done with
this process. The goal is for this process is to be safer/clearer/better
defined way.

As we move forward, we want to balance the powers in such a way that we may
want to pause a bit before we accept each proposal. 2 weeks for comments +
2 weeks for opinions will slow things down, but it shouldn't stall
meaningful work. I used 4 weeks for the process with the understanding that
most proposals are clear and easily acceptable. Controversial proposals
will likely need more time and thus will likely have be submitted at least
twice to discover a clear response.

"Accepting" a BIP means just that: It's accepted. What's acceptance mean?
This proposal provides an answer.

Client implementations, users, miners, and merchants can feel safe
implementing and using a feature that has clear acceptance. This process
isn't meant to force anything on client implementors, users, miners, or
merchants.
