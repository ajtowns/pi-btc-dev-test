Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal - Signatures of Messages using Bitcoin
	Private Keys
Message-ID: <CAK=nyAxXS6rQowFC6ENto+d+D9FzSf5WJLz-WM_vc2D5DQ2xQQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have written up a proposed BIP. It has to do with Signature formats when
using Bitcoin Private keys. It is here:
https://github.com/cgilliard/BIP/blob/master/README.md

This BIP was written up as suggested in this github issue:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10542

Note that the proposal is inline with the implementation that Trezor
implemented in the above issue.

Any feedback would be appreciated. Please let me know what the steps are
with regards to getting a BIP number assigned or any other process steps
required.

Regards,
Chris
