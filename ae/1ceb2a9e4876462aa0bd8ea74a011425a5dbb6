Don't do this.  It throws away all of the good stuff that git lets you record.  
There is more to a git branch than just the overall difference.  Every single 
log message and diff is individually valuable.  It's easy to make a squashed 
diff from many little commits; it's impossible to go the other way.

Command line for you so you don't have to think about it:

  git diff $(git merge-base master feature-branch) feature-branch 

git-merge-base finds the common ancestor between master and feature-branch, 
and then compares feature-branch against that.
