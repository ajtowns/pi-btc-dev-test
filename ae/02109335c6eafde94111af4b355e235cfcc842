That seems like a fairly simple, useful example that will require loops and
reused functions.  I'll add a fee that goes to the creator.

If it's voting for something consensus, you will need something special. If
it's not consensus (ie external) thw voting doesn't have to hit the chain
at all.
I don't see how "loops and reused functions" are needed in the scripting
language for this use case, but I'm probably missing some details. Please,
the more concrete you make your example, the easiest it will be for me to
understand.

But each scriptSig is only executed once with its corresponding
scriptPubKey. Are you proposing we change that?

I've been researching the topic of decentralized exchange from before the
term "colored coins" was first used (now there's multiple designs and
implementations); contributed to and reviewed many designs: none of them
(colored coins or not) required turing completeness.
I'm sorry, but what you are saying here is too vague for me to concretely
be able to refute the low level "needs" you claim your use cases to have.
