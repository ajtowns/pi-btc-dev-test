Hi,

is any progress or even discussion in this area?

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=181734.0

I don't insist on any specific solution, but this is becoming a real issue
as hardware wallets are more widespread. I'm sitting next to TREZOR for 40
minutes already, because it streams and validate some complex transaction.
By using proposed solution, such signature would be a matter of few seconds.

That's also not just about time/resource/hw cost optimization. I'm talking
about possibility of huge simplification of the firmware (=security FTW),
because 50% of actual codebase is solving this particular downside of
Bitcoin protocol.

So, there's real world problem. On which solution can we as a community
find a wide agreement?

Best,
Marek
