Consensus is that this process is too painful to go through once a year.  I
agree.

If you disagree and would like to see a Blocksize Council meet once a year
to issue a decree on what the maximum block size shall be for the next
year, then propose a process for who gets to sit on the Council and how
their decrees are enforced.....

Simulations show that:

Latency/bandwidth matter for miners.  Low latency, high bandwidth is
better. However, miners with bad connectivity can simply create smaller
blocks...

... until transaction fees become significant.  But by the time that
happens, protocol optimizations of block propagation will make the block
size an insignificant term in the "how profitable is it to mine in THIS
particular place on the Internet / part of the world" equation.

)

So: for the immediate future, there is no problem. And in the long term,
there is no problem.
