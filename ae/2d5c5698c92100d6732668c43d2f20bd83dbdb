BIP148 began with 8 months lead time, reduced to 5 months from popular request 
and technical considerations. There is nothing about BIP148 that compels an 
attempted hardfork 90 days later - that could just as well have been 18 
months.

That's not true at all. Based on my observations, only approximately 20% of 
the community follow Core's technical lead without significant consideration 
of their own - and who knows if that would change if Core were to suggest 
clearly-unsafe block size increases, or attempted to force a hardfork against 
consensus. Even with Core's support, many people would oppose the hardfork 
attempt, and it would fail.

Segwit2x's hardfork does not compel the remaining Bitcoin users to also 
hardfork.

I concur, but I disagree your approach has any possibility of a united 
Bitcoin. The only way to get that today, would be to do Segwit+Drivechain, not 
Segwit+Hardfork.
