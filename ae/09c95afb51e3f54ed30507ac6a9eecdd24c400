It seems to me that the internet as a whole has got this one covered. I say
this as someone who thinks that BitCoin needs to choose its battles and
craft its reputation extremely carefully; this isn't the most important
fight for BitCoin, nor the most deadly.

I do think SOPA and PIPA could impact bitcoin, what if, for instance,
copyrighted material made its way into the blockchain?

Already the DMCA would make it hard for someone publishing blocks online to
do anything but cease under a DMCA request. SOPA, at least, would go
farther and allow the US to cut all access to 'offending' sites elsewhere
in the world.

At any rate, I don't think these bills are 'aimed at' BitCoin, and the
companies with the most stake are taking the threat quite seriously.
