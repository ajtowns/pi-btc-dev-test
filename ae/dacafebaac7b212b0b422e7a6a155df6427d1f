There's no way to obtain the memory pools of your peers today, so if
you're newly started up it can happen that you get blocks with unseen
transactions.

For vectors variant, I wonder if it'd be safe to report the number of
confirmations differently for the duration of a chain split. If you
have a block but a majority of peers relayed a block that split the
chain, subtract 1 from each confirmation reported via RPC.
