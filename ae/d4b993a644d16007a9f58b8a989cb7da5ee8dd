A minimum block size does nothing to prevent the problems that come
from schism hardforks.
But also a minimum block size can be trivially cheated as recently
explained on this list:

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010317.html

"[...] miners can just pay to themselves to follow the minimum size
block rule without risking anything.
As long as they have a single matured satoshi they can just pay to
themselves with it as many times as they need in the same block."

It is good to search previous post before proposing or asking
something (it could have been proposed/asked earlier):
