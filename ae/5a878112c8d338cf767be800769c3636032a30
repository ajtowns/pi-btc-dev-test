If you're *actually* just doing timestamping you're better off using OpenTimestamps. But many times people think they're just doing timestamping in reality mere timestamps are insufficient for the task.

Notably, this is something the Satoshi Bitcoin white paper gets wrong, incorrectly describing Bitcoin as a timestamping system: timestamping is insufficient to prevent double-spends.
