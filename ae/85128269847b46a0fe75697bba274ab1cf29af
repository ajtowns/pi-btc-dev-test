Thanks Eric.

It would be a pity if early witnesses got lost due to nodes abandoning them
by running witnessless. But as long as there's at least one accessible
source for them left we're OKish. Let's hope we don't get to that point in
the near future. As long as Bitcoin Core doesn't implement witnessless
mode, there's little risk.

What do people here think about the benefits and risks with running
witnessless?
