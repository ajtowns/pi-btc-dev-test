I do agree with you here

e.g. I think the question of the ISO code (XBT vs BTC) is probably out of
scope for this thread, and there was no clear consensus, when it came up on
the forums.

As a data point, the price of bitcoin has gone up roughly 1000x since
satoshi made his suggestion that the decimal point could move 3 places.

I dont think it's a question of centralization, I was just seeking opinion
on what people felt about the reference implementation.  How about just
changing the default value in the dropdown from BTC -> to mBTC

The the other clients and exchange choose whether they want to follow suit
or not
