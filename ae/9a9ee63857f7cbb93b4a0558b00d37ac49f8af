Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Pull request: Optimize database writes for
	transactions with lots of TxIns.
Message-ID: <CABsx9T1g2p71YLeDz5mocUJTpjaKN0tKRaFQ_HcLWyKNOaT1pw@mail.gmail.com>

And I'd appreciate review/feedback on this:
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/491

Patch from ArtForz, who discovered the problem.

The problem was chaining large transactions (transactions with lots of
ins and outs) would make the berkeley db transaction log get very big,
as the dependencies (TxIns) of a transaction might be re-written
multiple times.

With this fix, each each transaction referred to by TxIns is written once.
