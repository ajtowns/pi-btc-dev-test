Bear in mind that getutxo does not return the spending transaction - it
can't because the UTXO set doesn't record this information (a spent txo is
deleted).

However, if you have sufficient peers and one is honest, the divergence can
be detected and the operation stopped/the user alerted. If all peers are
lying i.e. your internet connection is controlled by an attacker, it
doesn't really make much difference because they could swallow the
transaction you're trying to broadcast anyway. Ultimately if your peers
think a TXO is spent and refuse to relay transactions that spend them, you
can't do much about it even in the non-SPV context: you *must* be able to
reach at least one peer who believes in the same world as you do.
