BIP70 is quite safe agains MitB. If user copies URL belonging to other
merchant, he would see the fact after entering it into his wallet
application. The only problem is, attacker can buy from the same
merchant with user's money. (sending him different URL) This can be
mitigated by merchant setting "memo" to the description of the basket
and some user info (e.g. address to which goods are sent).

But if whole computer is compromised, you're already screwed. Trezor
should help, but I'm not sure if it supports BIP70.
