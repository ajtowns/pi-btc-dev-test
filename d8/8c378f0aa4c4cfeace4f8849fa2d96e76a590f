I'm working on (slowly) making a client able to download-on-demand.  That is 
to say that the block chain headers would be downloaded and maintained, but 
the block bodies would be downloaded as needed for full verification.  It's 
certainly not possible with the current protocol; but it's certainly a 
conceivable application.  I suppose it slots between headers-only and full 
client conceptually.
