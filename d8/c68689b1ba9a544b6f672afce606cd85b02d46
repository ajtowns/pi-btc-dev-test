Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed BIP status changes
Message-ID: <CA+s+GJApfj5OAxGyHG9CsmRHTpAQBgC44iU2U99LwNGNZDATBw@mail.gmail.com>

These BIPs should go to Final state - they are implemented all over
the place, and are thus entirely fixed in place now. Any changes would
require a new BIP as amandment:

- BIP 14 (BIP Protocol Version and User Agent)

- BIP 21 (URI Scheme)

- BIP 22 (getblocktemplate - Fundamentals)

- BIP 31 (Pong Message)

- BIP 34 (Block v2, Height in coinbase)

- BIP 35 (mempool message)

- BIP 37 (Bloom filtering)

Let me know if you (don't) agree.

Wladimir
