It is clear from recent events that miners are willing to collaborate
together for the greater good of their industry. Miners have also
publicly shown support for raising the blocksize collaboratively.

Obviously, as transaction volume grows they want to collect as many
transaction fees as possible so if there isnt enough space in blocks,
they're going to vote for increases because it's in their collective
financial interests. The proposal specifically encourages
collaboration and hinders antisocial behaviour, and it specifically
encourages the blocksize to be raised according to demand without
neutering the fee market.
