I don't buy that argument, you are saying a company will give away profits 
because of... what? It can?

The reason of it being faster makes no sense, as your example the channel has 
been open for a month then he really doesn't care it takes 1, 10 or 50 blocks 
before his transaction is included.  What is 5 hours wait on a month of profit?
