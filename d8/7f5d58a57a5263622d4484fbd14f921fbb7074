Actually, the economy does not necessarily include miners, and in fact the 
present miner community for the most part does not overlap significantly with 
economic activity. And at the same time, miners also have a tendency to 
upgrade at a different rate than the economy. It might make sense to 
incorporate a miner-trigger, but *only if* the flag is enabled in nodes by an 
option disabled by default, and the BIP clearly specifies that miners must not 
enable it until they perceive complete economic adoption of the change.
