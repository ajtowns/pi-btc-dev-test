Hi,

this is great.

something I'm willing to compromise on. As I'm looking at the draft, we
currently have 13 records and only 3 of them have keys... Matejcik was a
bit keener on this, so we'll try to discuss this more during the week
and we also look at the draft more carefully to see if we can come up
with some nit-picks.

I agree. If we're arguing for not using protobuf, because it is a
dependency, we shouldn't add dependency for some lesser-known encoding
format.

As was partially brought up by William, shouldn't we consider using
bech32? It doesn't break on double-click and it is a dependency for
native Segwit addresses anyway, so wallets might already support it or
they will at some point. But we should probably run some numbers on this
first, since bech32 will obviously be larger than base64.

I agree. It doesn't hurt if the global section stays and it is more
forward-looking.


Best,
Tomas
