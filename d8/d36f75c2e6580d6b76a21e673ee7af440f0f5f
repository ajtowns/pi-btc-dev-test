The "mempool" command allows nodes to request the contents of a peers
memory pool, yes.

It is currently used by SPV clients to find transactions that were
broadcast before they were started up (but not yet confirmed).

0.9 has code to save the mempool to disk.

Er, you mean, distinguishing features beyond the nodes IP address?

The contents of the mempool may vary depending on when the node was started
and what it saw at what times. I guess it's distinguishing in a way, but
not in any important way. Nodes are not intended to be completely
indistinguishable, just indistinguishable enough that it doesn't matter
which you connect to.

I don't think so, unless there are quirks to do with sendrawtransaction
RPCs or strangely crafted wallet spends. Normally if a tx is in the mempool
it will be relayed.

I don't know of any such place, but I'm sure people have compiled tables
somewhere.
