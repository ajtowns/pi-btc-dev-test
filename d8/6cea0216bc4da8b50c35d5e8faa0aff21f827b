Hi Martin,

this is the perfect venue to discuss this, welcome to the mailing list :-)
Like you I think that using the first forked block as the forkchain's
genesis block is the way to go, keeping the non-forked blockchain on the
original genesis hash, to avoid disruption. It may become more difficult in
the case one chain doesn't declare itself to be the forked chain.

Even more interesting are channels that are open during the fork. In these
cases we open a single channel, and will have to settle two. If no replay
protection was implemented on the fork, then we can use the last commitment
to close the channel (updates should be avoided since they now double any
intended effect), if replay protection was implemented then commitments
become invalid on the fork, and people will lose money.

Fun times ahead :-)

Cheers,
Christian
