It is trusted if (1) it is final (i.e. it can't be replaced), (2) it
is not in a block that was reorged out (negative confirmation count),
(3) the 'spend zero conf change' option is set, (4) it is in the
mempool, and (5) all inputs are from us.

A transaction is conflicted if a different transaction exists that
spends the same inputs. A transaction gets -N confirmations if it is
mined in a block, and that block is orphaned away, and a different
transaction is mined in the new block so that the transaction becomes
a double spend.
