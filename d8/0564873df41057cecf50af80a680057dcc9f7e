This would be true if gmake didn't build/run basically everywhere; but, it does.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending autotools' design or implementation. It is; however, more ubiquitous and understood by a much wider audience.

I would say that's actually a mark against cmake. If you need a gui to select build options because your cli doesn't have proper help output something is wrong.

If you're willing to setup and maintain a cmake build environment I wouldn't say it should be rejected outright. Speculating about it without an implementation to compare seems like a waste of time.

Especially when jaromil already has a mostly-functional autotools setup. It needs tweaking still and some changes to catch up and rebase, but it works. He also already did the tedious work to rearrange the source tree to make adding any auto-configuration tool for the build environment easy to drop in place. (Which is already merged.)
