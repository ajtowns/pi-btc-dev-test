Wouldn't block withhold be fixed by not letting miners in pools know which
block candidates are valid before the pool knows? (Note: I haven't read any
other proposals for how to fix it, this may already be known)

As an example, by having the pool use the unique per-miner nonces sent to
each miner for effective division of labor as a kind of seed / commitment
value, where one in X block candidates will be valid, where X is the
current ratio between partial PoW blocks sent as mining proofs and the full
difficulty?

The computational work of the pool remains low (checking this isn't harder
than the partial PoW validation already performed), they pool simply looks
at which commitment value from the pool that the miner used, looks up the
correct committed value and hashes that together with the partial PoW. If
it hits the target, the block is valid.
