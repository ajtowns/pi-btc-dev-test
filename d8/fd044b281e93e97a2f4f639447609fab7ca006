Subject: [bitcoin-dev] "Changes without unanimous consent" talk at Scaling
	Bitcoin
Message-ID: <20171105175033.GB23915@erisian.com.au>

Hi,

Paper (and slides) for my talk in the Consensus stream of Scaling Bitcoin
this morning are at:

   https://github.com/ajtowns/sc-btc-2017/releases

Some analysis for split-related consensus changes, and (code-less)
proposals for generic replay protection (a la BIP 115) and providing a
better level of price discovery for proposals that could cause splits.

Cheers,
aj
