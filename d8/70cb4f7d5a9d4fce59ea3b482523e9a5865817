I'm sorry, I missed your "if everyone is paying it". This changes a lot. I
agree with you: if everyone wants to pay much then it becomes unreliable.

But I don't think that is something we can avoid with a small constant
factor block size increase, and we don't do the world a service by making
it look like it works for longer.

Let's grow within bounderies set by technology and centralization pressure
that we can agree on. Let the market decide whether how they will that will
low volume reliable transactions and/or high volume unreliable ones.
