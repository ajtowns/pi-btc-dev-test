Interesting.  You set the share-block size to 16kB and set the share POW to
1/64 of the main target.

Each share-block would be allowed to append up to 16kB on the previous
share-block.

This would keep the bandwidth the same, but on average blocks would be only
512kB.

This effect could be reduced by having "colours" for blocks and
transactions.

The block colour would be a loop based on block height.

You could have 16 transaction "colours" based on the lowest 4 bits in the
txId.

A transaction is only valid if all inputs into the transaction are the
correct colour for that block.

This allows blocks to be created in advance.  If you are processing colour
7 at the moment, you can have a colour 8 block ready.

16 colours is probably to many.   It would only be necessary for things
like 1 second block rates.

The disadvantage is that wallets would have to make sure that they have
coins for each of the 16 colours.

If you spend the wrong colour, you add 16 block times of latency.

In a shop setting, you could set it up so that the person scans a QR-code
to setup a channel with the shop.

They can then scan all their stuff and by the time they have done that, the
channel would be ready.

If there was a queue, it could be done when the person enters the queue.

In fact, there could be QR-codes at multiple locations.
