Subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.4 Release Candidate 2
Message-ID: <CABsx9T2Y3CmBr=twHvFOEoQCVcSySZ+JyEQXcOseRKxJi3KoLw@mail.gmail.com>

I just tagged the git tree:  v0.4.00rc2

Fixes from release candidate 1:

+ Optimize database writes for transactions with lots of inputs
+ Fix a deadlock that could occur when adding addresses from 'addr'
messages and irc
+ Fix a potential problem with duplicate, un-spendable coinbase
transactions if you were generating bitcoins, with a locked wallet,
and ran out of keypool keys.
