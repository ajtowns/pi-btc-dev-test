The process loses meaning if it doesn't reflect reality. So only hardforks 
should go through the hardfork process; only softforks through the softfork 
process; etc. Trying to make one-size-fits-all just means de facto accepted 
BIPs wouldn't be recognised as such because nobody cares to meet the higher 
requirements.
