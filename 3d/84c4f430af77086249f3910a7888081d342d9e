Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Beyond IP transactions: towards a bitcoin
	payment protocol
Message-ID: <20110923162102.GA13532@ulyssis.org>

Hello everyone,

here is an idea i've bean writing up: https://gist.github.com/1237788

I hope it can start some discussion about moving away from static bitcoin addresses
as descriptions for transactions. I suppose it's a candidate for a BIP/BEPS/BFC/...,
but as things don't seem to have been decided completely about those, I put it in a
Gist.

Please, comment.
