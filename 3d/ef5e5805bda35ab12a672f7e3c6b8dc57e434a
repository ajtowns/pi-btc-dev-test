While I agree that the problem seeds should be fixed, it also sounds
like a problem with bitcoinj / other layers, if a malfunctioning seed
is a problem for your app.

Seeds are fundamentally a backup for peer exchange.  You are going to
run into problems if you rely 100% on seeds, always.

Further, there are multiple seeds so that we are not impacted if a
couple seeds malfunction or die.  All bitcoin apps must take this into
account.
