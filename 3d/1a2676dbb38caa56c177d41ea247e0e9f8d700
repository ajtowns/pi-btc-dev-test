It cites SPV as an example, doesn't mention bloom filters.. and sure--
sounds like the bip text should make the

Not passively, undetectable, and against thousands of users at once at low cost.

Not against Bitcoin Core, transactions are batched and relayed in
sorted order.  (obviously there are limits at what this provides;
ironically, the lack of link encryption has been used to argue against
privacy preserving relay behavior)

Huh? The first and subsequent hops obscures the origin and timing.

Of course there is no need to worry about Sybil attacks when all of your peers are authenticated. But again, let us not ignore the problems of requiring all peers on the network be authenticated.

Don't need and want them for what?  For _partitioning_ resistance,
you are not partitioned if you have one honest connection to the
functional network. Additional peers purely reduce your partition
vulnerability-- so long as an active network attacker isn't
itercepting all your connections out.

For privacy, you have improve transaction privacy so long as your
transaction isn't initially relayed to a malicious peer-- but
malicious peers can lie further out because transit nodes obscure the
order of message creation.  Bitcoin Core currently relays transactions
first and more frequently to outbound and whitelisted peers.

I understood that, but my point was that Bitcoin cannot be used at
all_unless users have secure communication channels to share
addresses.

They're not required to _only_ connect with anonymous peers. And
partition resistance requires that you have any one good link.

Not via passive observation.

Glad you agree.

We seem to be looping now. Feel free to not implement this proposal,
no one suggests making it mandatory.
