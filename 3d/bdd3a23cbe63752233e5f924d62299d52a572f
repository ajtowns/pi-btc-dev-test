Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposed minor change to BIP 01 to use a PR for
 request assignment

I think it's a reasonable approach. Once the number is assigned, the 
change is made and the pull request is updated.

Only thing is it would be nice to be able to indicate which pull 
requests are number requests and which pull requests are ready for 
merging. Perhaps we should make a special label for number requests.
