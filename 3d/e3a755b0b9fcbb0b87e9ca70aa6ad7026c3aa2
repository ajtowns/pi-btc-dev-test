Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP0039: Final call
Message-ID: <CAJna-HjGHpru6Lpv_tXUkWR2mX-=fobzojtHYvSRJy6+CMesOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

during recent months we've reconsidered all comments which we received from
the community about our BIP39 proposal and we tried to meet all
requirements for such standard. Specifically the proposal now doesn't
require any specific wordlist, so every client can use its very own list of
preferred words. Generated mnemonic can be then applied to any other
BIP39-compatible client. Please follow current draft at
https://github.com/trezor/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki.

Because we're quickly moving towards release of Trezor firmware and we need
to finalize this part of the firmware, we're asking for the last comments
to current BIP39 draft.

Thanks,
slush
