Despite the tedious explanation of absolute advantage, this is simply
an argument for all people to pay one person to mine, as there is
presumably always one person who will be able to mine more efficiently
than all others.

The argument fails to recognize that mining for one's self may (or may
not) result in a net loss, but donating to a miner in the hope of some
action is comparatively a total loss. One is an expense in exchange
for the intended social outcome, and the other is payment for
representative government.

And in this form of representative government that you propose, if we
assume that miners are somehow bound to honor the payments (votes),
how are the votes distributed? Is this supposed to be democratic in
the sense of one person one vote? Your argument below is clearly based
on that idea. However the result would be very different. The
wealthier would of course exert the greater influence. So the idea
fails by its own standard.

You are making a political argument wrapped in appeal to emotion. Both
are pointless in this context.
