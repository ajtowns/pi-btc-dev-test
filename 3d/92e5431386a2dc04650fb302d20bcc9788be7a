While being in the Bitcoin community for a long time, I haven't been
so directly involved in the development.  However I wish to suggest a
different pre-hard-fork soft-fork approach:


Set a 'block size cap' in the similar same way as we set difficulty.

Every 2016 blocks take the average size of the blocks and multiply the
size by 1.5x, rejecting blocks that are larger than this size, for the
next 2016 period.

I would of-course suggest that we keep the limits at min 100kb and max
(initially) 990kb (not 1mb on purpose, as this should become the new
limit), rounding up to the nearest 10kb.

A: we don't have pressure at the 1mb limit, (we reduce the limit in a
flexible manner to 990kb).

B: we can upgrade the network to XYZ hard-limit, then slowly raze the
soft-limit after being sure the network, as-a-whole is ready.

If we on-day remove the block-size limit, this rule will stop a rouge
miner from making 10mb, or 100mb blocks, or 1gb blocks.

This could be implemented by the miners without breaking any of the
clients, and would tend to produce a better dynamic fee pressure.


This will give the mechanics to the miners to create consensus to
agree what block-sizes they believe are best for the network, and
allows the block-sizes to dynamically grow in response to larger demand.
