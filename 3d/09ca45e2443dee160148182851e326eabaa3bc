Although this is a somewhat appealing notion, would it really improve
feature velocity? I don't think the current p2p protocol is holding
anything back, and having to implement features twice in two protocols
would slow things down quite a bit.

Probably the lowest hanging fruit now is fixing the 100msec sleep and just
generally having tools to measure latency and queuing inside the code.
