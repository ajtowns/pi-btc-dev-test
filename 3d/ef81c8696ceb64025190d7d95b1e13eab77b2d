Jochen, two alternatives were raised in public discussion:

Use a scheme which supports delegatable hardening-- (there are two
broad classes proposed, one where the delegated party learns
information that would let them bypass the part of the hardening they
perform but only that part, and another where the delegation is
information theoretically private.)

or

Eschew the pretextual 'hardening' that serves no purpose but to cause
users to think the scheme is more secure than it is, and which makes
the system more complex to implement.

Both were rejected by the authors of that spec.

This ignores the history of that spec and the widespread use. Because
of the design, the check value can't be computed without a fixed
dictionary, and many people do use it as a brainwallet-- which is what
that BIP originally specified, in fact.
