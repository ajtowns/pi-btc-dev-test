Please comment if possible on some of the techno-cultural implications
of ongoing development of bi-directional micropayment channels?

For example, consider zakat example(s):
www[dot]hidaya[dot]org/publications/zakat-information/10-what-is-zakat-obligatory-charity
That involves a system based on trust and which is somewhat circular
in nature (such funds as are going in one direction may also be going
simultaneously on balance in another direction somewhere else), where
the trustless bitcoin utilizes math, rather than personal trust in
order to keep the system going.
Here is some more on zakat:
en[dot]wikipedia[dot]org/wiki/Zakat
en[dot]wikipedia[dot]org/wiki/Ridda_wars (Discusses in depth some
differences between Sunni and Shiite on the subject of Zakat)

A sort of traditional philanthropic historic overview in the USA from
the 1900s forward is seen here, but it is fairly minimal and not too
revealing:
www[dot]nptrust[dot]org/history-of-giving/timeline/1900s/

A general microgiving example(s) (not yet fully modeled but for which
some prototype software ideas and concepts are in process today):
abis[dot]io
