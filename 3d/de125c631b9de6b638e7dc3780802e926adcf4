Bitcoin has no concept of identity, but in any type of commercial 
transaction the parties involved must know some minimal amount of 
identity information in order to transact at all.

Except for some identifiable special cases, I think a payee is perfectly 
justified in treating a double spend of a payment sent to them as part 
of a commercial transaction as a fraud attempt and employing whatever 
non-Bitcoin recourse mechanisms, if any, they have access to.

- From the perspective of the network, the obviously correct action for 
any node or miner is to relay the first version of any transaction they 
see. The primary purpose of mining is to resolve this 
otherwise-unresolvable problem of determining which transaction among a 
set of conflicting transactions happened first.

If a node or miner wants to deviate from the obviously correct 
behaviour, and if they want to avoid harming the value of the network, 
they should be particularly careful to make sure their deviation from 
"first seen" doesn't introduce harmful unintended side effects, like 
making fraud easier.
