Need is an awfully big word.  One thing we are certain of is that some 
guy telling us all that we are wrong is nowhere near the "need" level.

Don't take this the wrong way, but things like this make it very hard 
for us to take you seriously.

Please read up on how the system works, then read up on why we reject 
the argument from authority, then if you still have something to say, 
please do so in a proper venue.  One option for this discussion is the 
bitcointalk.org forums, where you will find literally dozens of threads 
proposing the exact same thing you are proposing.

This mailing list is NOT for political discussion.
