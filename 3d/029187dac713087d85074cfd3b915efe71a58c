Absolutely agree that we should be signaling the danger of using noinput
as clearly as possible to developers, and I'm more than happy to adopt
the _unsafe suffix suggested by jb55. I think using non-sighash_all
sighashes is always a huge danger, as you have correctly pointed out, so
maybe we should be marking all of them as being unsafe, or make sure to
communicate that danger on a higher level (docs).
