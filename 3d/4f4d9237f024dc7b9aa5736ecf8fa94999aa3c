Hello,

Our reasoning for coming up with a new method for miner configuration
was stated here: https://github.com/slushpool/stratumprotocol/issues/1

It is primarily the determinism of expecting the response. That is
the reason why we chose a new method mining.configure instead of an
existing mining.capabilities that was not being very well documented or
used.
