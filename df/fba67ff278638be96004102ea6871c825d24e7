Miners do not care about the age of a UTXO entry, apart for two exceptions.
It is also economically irrelevant.
* There is a free transaction policy, which sets a small portion of block
space aside for transactions which do not pay sufficient fee. This is
mostly an altruistic way of encouraging Bitcoin adoption. As a DoS
prevention mechanism, there is a requirement that these free transactions
are of sufficient priority (computed as BTC-days-destroyed per byte),
essentially requiring these transactions to consume another scarce
resource, even if not money.
* Coinbase transaction outputs can, as a consensus rule, only be spent
after 100 confirmations. This is to prevent random reorganisations from
invalidating transactions that spend young coinbase transactions (which
can't move to the new chain). In addition, wallets also select more
confirmed outputs first to consume, for the same reason.
