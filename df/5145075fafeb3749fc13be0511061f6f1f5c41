Each block that you solve has a reward.  In practice, some blocks will 
be orphaned, so the expected reward is slightly less than the nominal 
reward.  Each second that you delay publishing a block, the expected 
reward drops somewhat.

On an infinite timeline, the total reward approaches the expected 
reward.  But reality is discrete, and zero tends to be a brick wall.  If 
you delay publishing a block, you will get either the nominal reward, or 
zero, not some fraction in between.  And if your personal random walk 
involves an excursion through negative land, you may not stick around 
long enough for it to come back.

Thus, a positive expected value is not sufficient for some strategy to 
be a good one.
