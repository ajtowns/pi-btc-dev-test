That's an over-generalization.  There are two kinds of soft-forks WRT mining,
those which:

1. involve new validation rules by data-hiding from non-upgraded modes
    (e.g. extension blocks, generalized softfork)
2. involve NO new validation logic (e.g. P2SH)

Miners which are not validating transactions *should* be deprived of revenue,
because their role is transaction validation, not simply brute forcing sha256d.

So I'm very strongly against this "generalized softfork" idea -- I also don't
see how upgraded nodes and non-upgraded nodes can possibly end up with the same
UTXO set.

Which is why it should be put into core long before forks.  ;-)
