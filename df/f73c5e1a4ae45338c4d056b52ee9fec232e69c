Regarding "problem" #2 where you say "How do we ensure that all valid
transactions are eventually included in the blockchain?":  I do not believe
that all people would (a) agree this is a problem or (b) that we do want to
*ENSURE* that *ALL* valid transactions are eventually included in the
blockchain.  There are many *valid* transactions that oftentimes miners do
not (and should not) wish to require be confirmed and included in the
blockchain.  Spam transactions for example can be valid, but used to attack
bitcoin by using no or low fee.  Any valid transaction MAY be included by a
miner, but requiring it in some fashion at this point would open the
network to other attack vectors.  Perhaps you meant it a different way.

sense to resolve these two problems together. Using the proposed system for
variable block sizes would solve the first problem but there would still be
a whole bunch of never confirming transactions. I am not sure how to
reliably solve the second problem at scale without first solving the first.

explicits asks miners to ignore their best interests, and confirm
transactions by "priority".  What are you going to do if a "malicious"
miner decides to go after their profits and order by what makes them the
most money. Add "ordered by priority" as a consensus requirement? And even
if you miners can still sort their mempool by fee, and then order the top
1MB by priority.

from the available transaction pool. As with so many other things, it is
necessary to partially ignore short-term gain for long-term benefit. It is
in miners and everybody's long-term interest to have a reliable transaction
service. A busy transaction service that confirms lots of transactions per
hour will become more profitable as demand increases and more users are
prepared to pay for priority. As it is there is currently no way to fully
scale because of the transaction bandwidth limit and that is problematic.
If all valid transactions must eventually confirm then there must be a way
to resolve that problem.

been waiting in the pool then, each node could simply keep track of when a

routine, however, for example, if a node was offline, how should it
differentiate how long each transaction was waiting in that case? If a node
was restarted daily would it always think that all transactions had been
waiting in the pool less than one day If each node keeps the current
transaction pool in a file and updates it, as transactions are included in
blocks and, as new transactions appear in the pool, then that would go some
way to alleviate the issue, apart from entirely new nodes. There should be
no reason the contents of a transaction pool files cannot be shared without
agreement as to the transaction pool between nodes, just as nodes transmit
new transactions freely.

how many transactions to include in a block, I say it is a standoff and
miners will conform to the proposal, not wanting to leave transactions with
valid fees standing, and, not wanting to shrink the transaction pool. In
any case, if miners shrink the transaction pool then I am not immediately
concerned since it provides a more efficient service. For the question of
including transactions according to the proposal, I say if it is possible
to keep track of how long transactions are waiting in the pool so that they
can be included on a probability curve then it is possible to verify that
blocks conform to the proposal, since the input is a probability, the
output should conform to a probability curve.

target confirmation from the fee recommendation. That transaction has still
not confirmed after now more than six days - even waiting twice as long
seems quite reasonable to me. That transaction is a valid transaction; it
is not rubbish, junk or, spam. Under the current model with transaction
bandwidth limitation, the longer a transaction waits, the less likely it is
ever to confirm due to rising transaction numbers and being pushed back by
transactions with rising fees.

transactions might be spam. Having an ever-increasing number of valid
transactions that do not confirm as more new transactions with higher fees
are created is the opposite of operating a robust, reliable transaction
system.

confirm. Even a business choosing a modest fee has no guarantee that their
valid transaction will not be shuffled down by new transactions to the
realm of never confirming after it is created. Consumers also will not
accept this model as Bitcoin expands. If Bitcoin cannot be a reliable
payment system for confirmed transactions then consumers, by and large,
will simply not accept the model once they understand. Bitcoin will be a
dirty payment system, and this will kill the value of Bitcoin.

Simply doubling block sizes every so often is reactionary and is not a
reliable permanent solution. I have written a BIP proposal for a technical
solution but, need your help to write it up to an acceptable standard to be
a full BIP.

Fees are artificially inflated due to bandwidth limitations while failing
to provide a full confirmation service for all transactions.

> Provide each transaction with an individual transaction priority each
time before choosing transactions to include in the current block, the
priority being a function of the fee paid (on a curve), and the time
waiting in the transaction pool (also on a curve) out to n days (n=60 ?).
The transaction priority to serve as the likelihood of a transaction being
included in the current block, and for determining the order in which
transactions are tried to see if they will be included.
>
> Use a target block size. Determine the target block size using; current
transaction pool size x ( 1 / (144 x n days ) ) = number of transactions to
be included in the current block. Broadcast the next target block size with
the current block when it is solved so that nodes know the next target
block size for the block that they are building on.
>
> The curves used for the priority of transactions would have to be
appropriate. Perhaps a mathematician with experience in probability can
develop the right formulae. My thinking is a steep curve. I suppose that
the probability of all transactions should probably account for a
sufficient number of inclusions that the target block size is met although,
it may not always be. As a suggestion, consider including some zero fee
transactions to pad, highest BTC value first?
>
> **Explanation of the operation of priority:**
> > If transaction priority is, for example, a number between one (low) and
one-hundred (high) it can be directly understood as the percentage chance
in one-hundred of a transaction being included in the block. Using
probability or likelihood infers that there is some function of random. If
random (100) < transaction priority then the transaction is included.
>
> >To break it down further, if both the fee on a curve value and the time
waiting on a curve value are each a number between one and one-hundred, a
rudimentary method may be to simply multiply those two numbers, to find the
priority number. For example, a middle fee transaction waiting thirty days
(if n = 60 days) may have a value of five for each part  (yes, just five,
the values are on a curve). When multiplied that will give a priority value
of twenty-five, or,  a twenty-five percent chance at that moment of being
included in the block; it will likely be included in one of the next four
blocks, getting more likely each chance. If it is still not included then
the value of time waiting will be higher, making for more probability. A
very low fee transaction would have a value for the fee of one. It would
not be until near sixty-days that the particular low fee transaction has a
high likelihood of being included in the block.

to do this just based on the fee, that statistically, the blocks conform to
a fee distribution. Any zero fee transactions would have to be ignored.
This solution needs a clever mathematician.
