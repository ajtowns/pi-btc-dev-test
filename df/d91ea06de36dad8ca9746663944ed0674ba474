I think rather successfully. That Mike himself continues to misexplain
things is not surprising since he has all but outright said that his
motivation here is to disrupt Bitcoin in order to try to force his
blocksize hardfork on people. Since this motivation is uncorrelated
with any property of soft-forks or CLTV we should not expect his
position to change.

You're repeating Mike's claims there-- not anyone elses. Take your
complaint up with him-- not the list.
