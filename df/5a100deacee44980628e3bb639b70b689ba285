Note that we're generally aiming (though not yet enforcing) to have
merges done through the github-merge tool, which performs the merge
locally, shows the resulting diff, compares it with the merge done by
github, and GnuPG signs it.

That allows using github as easy-access mechanism for people to
contribute and inspect, while having a higher security standard for
the actual changes done to master.
