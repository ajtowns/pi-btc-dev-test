OTOH, the page's recommended config isn't really too ideal. While the new lock 
limit should be good for up to 2 block deep reorgs, I doubt merchants/miners 
want to get stuck if someone pulls off a 3-block deep reorg. Since we usually 
consider 6 blocks to be "confirmed beyond impossibility of reversal", a limit 
of at least 292692 should probably be recommended. Additionally, I suspect 
set_lg_max may need bumping upward - but I'm not quite sure how to calculate 
the correct value there.

Why does the example config do set_lg_dir? That will screw things up should 
the client be using some other directory for any reason..

Also, please add a note that 0.4.x, 0.5.x, 0.6.x, and 0.7.x will be receiving 
backports in their next stable releases sometime before May 15.
