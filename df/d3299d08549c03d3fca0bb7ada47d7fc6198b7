I don't think we're going to find that's practical unfortunately due to
change. Every payment I make ties up txouts, so if we try to base the
atomicity of payments on whether or not the payee decides to broadcast
the transaction the payor is stuck with txouts that they can't use until
the payee makes up their mind. That leads to lots and lots of nasty edge
cases.

OTOH if we base the atomicity of payment on whether or not a specific
txout exists everything those edge cases don't exist. Yes, that might
force us to expose transaction fees to the user, but after all it's the
user who has control over those fees.

A separate issue is IsStandard() rules, and a near-term project for me
is to write a much relaxed version of them based on soft-fork safe
whitelisting/blacklisting of opcodes, version numbers, mutability etc.
We can definitely get to the point where those rules will change very
little.
