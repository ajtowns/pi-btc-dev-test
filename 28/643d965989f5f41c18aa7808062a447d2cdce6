This is not a desired behavior. Do you have any idea how to make it even
more explicit in the spec? Currently we just have (in Account sectrion):

"This level splits the key space into independent user identities, so
the wallet never mixes the coins across different accounts."


I would like to make it obvious from the spec that if you mix funds
accross the accounts you are not doing a right thing and you are not
compliant to the spec.
