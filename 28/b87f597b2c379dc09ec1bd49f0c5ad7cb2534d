Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 release candidate 1 tagged
Message-ID: <20150519082555.GA17273@amethyst.visucore.com>

Hello,

I've just tagged release candidate 1 for 0.9.5 (tag `v0.9.5rc1`).

The reason for this backport release is to make BIP66 available on the 0.9 branch. This has been requested by a few users, mostly miners.

Full (preliminary) release notes can be found at: 
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.9/doc/release-notes.md

In contrast to 0.10.x releases it is unclear whether there will be enough gitian signatures for a binary release, any help with building is welcome.
See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.9/doc/release-process.md
(many steps have changed since then, so the release process for 0.10 or master will not work)

Wladimir
