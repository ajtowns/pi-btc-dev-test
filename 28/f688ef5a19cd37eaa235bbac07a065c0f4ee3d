Tails users usually can't really build it from source? talks is a live
boot mostly stateless linux distribution for privacy applications.
It's really good in general.

I agree that we shouldn't be statically linking QT on linux generally
(due to things like theming), though maybe we could just have the
build process dump out a seperate extra static QT binary just for
these other cases? I feel like the work maintaining it would be less
than what we've had in answering questions/complaints about it.
