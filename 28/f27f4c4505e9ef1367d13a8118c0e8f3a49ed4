I think this is our fundamental disagreement. People will burn coins to
encode data, why allow this when there's a better alternative?

Correct, but with BIP70 that key is in the user's wallet and you can

construction). Right now there's no way to do the transaction construction
on another machine with zero value OP_RETURNs.
