I agree with all this.  However, as a practical matter the consensus 
rules are not separated out so one person decides whether the "rough 
consensus" has been reached and if the consensus rules should be 
changed.  It really has nothing to do with any personality involved or 
whether they do a good or bad job.  The final decision should probably 
not fall into the lap of one person but it does for now and that is just 
the way it is because there is no better way to do it if you want to get 
things done.

I am also not saying any specific process is good or bad, I am saying 
the lack of a defined process causes wasted time and effort.  Once you 
define the process you have now (the baseline) then you can evaluate 
whether parts of it are good or bad.

As the developer system transitions into a paid system where commercial 
entities hire developers then there is no incentive for them to do that 
if changes can never be made.  A defined process will give more 
assurance for commercial entities to bring more developers on board.
