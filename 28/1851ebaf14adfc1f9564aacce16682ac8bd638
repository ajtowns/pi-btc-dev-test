In terms of miners, a strong supermajority is arguably sufficient, even 75%
would be enough.

The near total consensus required is merchants and users.  If (almost) all
merchants and users updated and only 75% of the miners updated, then that
would give a successful hard-fork.

On the other hand, if 99.99% of the miners updated and only 75% of
merchants and 75% of users updated, then that would be a serioud split of
the network.

The advantage of strong miner support is that it effectively kills the fork
that follows the old rules.  The 25% of merchants and users sees a
blockchain stall.

Miners are likely to switch to the fork that is worth the most.  A mining
pool could even give 2 different sub-domains.  A hasher can pick which
rule-set to follow.  Most likely, they would converge on the fork which
paid the most, but the old ruleset would likely still have some hashing
power and would eventually re-target.
