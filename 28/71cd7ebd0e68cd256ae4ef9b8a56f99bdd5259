I'm presuming that schedule is just an example, as you'd end up with 
insanely large block sizes in a few years.

Absolutely, yes, an increase schedule is an option if people agree on 
it, and I think the better option, as the current limit too low, but 
jumping straight to a value big enough for "indefinitely" is a huge jump.

Gave some thought to scaling block size based on transaction fees, but 
suspect it would end up with miners sending huge fees to themselves with 
transactions that aren't relayed (so they only are actioned if they make 
it into a block that miner mines) to make the network allow bigger blocks.
