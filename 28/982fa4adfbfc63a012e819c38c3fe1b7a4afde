In terms of usage I think you'd more imagine a wallet that basically
parks Bitcoins onto channels at all times, so long as they are
routable there is no loss, and the scalability achieved thereby is
strongly advantageous, and there is even the potential for users to
earn fees by having their wallets participate in channel rebalancing
(where hubs pay users to rebalance channels - end up with the same net
position but move funds from one user-owned channel to another.)
Exchange deposit, withdrawal, payments, even in-exchange trades can
usefully happen in lightning for faster, cheaper more scalable
transactions.
