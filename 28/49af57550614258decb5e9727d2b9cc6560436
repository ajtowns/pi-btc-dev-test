Hi Mike,

I've looked but can't find a post like you're talking about.  Can you 
point me to it?

If so then bollocks... I'm looking for something useful to do atm.  
PoolServerJ is in a holding pattern atm as I've stabilisied all the bugs 
I know about and am waiting for several pools to finish testing and move 
into production so I'm twiddling thumbs trying to figure out how to 
spend my time.
