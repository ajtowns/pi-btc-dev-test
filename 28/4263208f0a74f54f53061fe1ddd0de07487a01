I think we should go with (2), changing the maximum address length and
validation is very easy. We'd need to

   - Change BitcoinAddressValidator::MaxAddressLength to 35
   - The addresses are validated with walletmodel->validateAddress which in
   turn calls CBitcoinAddress addressParsed(addr) and then isValid(). Does
   this work for the new addresses?

The set of allowed characters is still the same, so BitcoinAddressValidator
doesn't have to be changed.

Advanced dialogs for constructing the addresses / adding them to the
address book could wait for 0.7.0.
