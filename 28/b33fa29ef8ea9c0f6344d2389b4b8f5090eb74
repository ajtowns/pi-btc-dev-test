I'm not saying proof of work is the goal, the goal is still p2p
transaction serialization.
And that's achieved through proof of work, not through "miner's honesty".

Whatever, let's keep calling stupid miners "honest miners", smart
miners "dishonest-by-replace-by fee miners" and miners that do replace
by fee and also hash on top of old blocks "utterly dishonest miners".

Maybe Satoshi hadn't thought in depth about replace-by-fee when he
wrote the code.
Why should we care?
If nSequence was a design mistake Satoshi did, should we maintain it
to somehow honor him?
Maybe the payment protocol shouldn't have been developed because he
had some weird ideas about paying to ips? Maybe we shouldn't write any
tests because he didn't do so?
This persistent argument from authority is annoying.

It is not a protocol rule that validators can use to discriminate the
longest valid chain and therefore is not enforceable. Not even through
a softfork because miners can't know which transactions other miners
saw first.
So if it is a protocol rule, I think it shouldn't be.

Miners that mine on top of the longest valid chain are helping in
making transactions irreversible whether they implement a first-saw or
a replace-by-fee policy.

That's not what I'm saying. Miners that don't mine on top of the
longest chain are dishonest by my own definition as well.
You want to equate replace-by-fee "dishonesty" with
trying-to-rewrite-history dishonesty by saying that the transactions
that "have been seen" in the network are already history and that's
where we disagree. I think only what's in the chain is history and I
also think that's the whole point of proof of work.
And I also disagree that all the people who think this way are
"hopelessly confused". We may be confused, but I think there's always
hope for removing confusions provided that there's will to learn,
which I think it is at least my case.

This is in fact quite polemic and thus obviously not obvious.
Bitcoin works because rewriting the chain gets exponentially more
expensive as time passes.

I see now that I may have not properly expressed myself in the earlier
post since you clearly misunderstood what I meant by "smart miners".
By that I mean miners implementing replace-by-fee and
child-pays-for-parent policies Not miners trying to rewrite history,
which I agree is about as smart as mining on top of orphan blocks.
