I think it would be logical to do as part of a hardfork that moved
commitments generally; e.g. a better position for merged mining (such
a hardfork was suggested in 2010 as something that could be done if
merged mining was used), room for commitments to additional block
back-references for compact SPV proofs, and/or UTXO set commitments.
Part of the reason to not do it now is that the requirements for the
other things that would be there are not yet well defined. For these
other applications, the additional overhead is actually fairly
meaningful; unlike the fraud proofs.
