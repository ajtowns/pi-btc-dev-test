I think that "accepted" should mean that the master github branch, and relevant project releases should incorporate the BIP as soon as reasonably possible after a branch is created that passes security and code competence checks. In other words, the "YES" votes may have to implement the BIP or pay to have it implemented.

Timeline
--------

that's an important point. I've gotten that echoed from a few people
now. I was thinking that a re-submit could be called if more time is
needed but I think your method of allowing the author to have control
over the pace makes a lot of sense.

What does accepted mean? "Accepted" is the hardest thing to grasp in
this paper. There's just no way to force client authors, users, and
miners, to integrate and use a change, even if one is accepted by my
process. I.e. I'm trying to define what "accepted" even means, but
maybe I should use different words that don't have baggage. Like my
process could indicate "community greenlight" and client authors who
refuse to follow "community greenlight" can do so, but they are going
against the wishes of the community and that becomes obvious. Other
client others (like btcd) might follow the greenlight recommendation
instead and users are free to switch to that. Then there could also be
"community redlight", and "no decision reached" in which there was
conflicting views.

If I go this route, I could use the word "accepted" to mean something
like "appears in the longest fork", or "is in use by multiple clients,
merchants, & users" (for things like urls that aren't
blockchain-related).

How to prove stake?
--------------------

"How groups prove their stake" is the hard question that has to be
addressed in this proposal or any. I've pushed forward several
recommendations but there's no perfect solution that everyone will
accept. For users, in the comments I suggested a "community sample"
method that requires that only a random few people in a group to give
up their privacy.

Ratios
------


The "accepted" or "greenlit" standard in my proposal is defined as:
least 70% of the represented percentage stake in 3 out of the 4
Bitcoin segments. It's true that it seems weird to have 1 group in a
segment by itself (seems like too much power), you have to recall that
committees can consist of several groups that have agreed to act
together. If the 1 miner group had conflicts they'd separate to make
public both their views.

I'm interested in if you think that definition should be changed or if
you are worried about those risks.

> I like your "community greenlight" idea to cover how BIPs apply to the larger community of wallet providers. However, I also think that there should be stronger language applied to the Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin XT (if a XIP is submitted). That language should make it absolutely clear that committers can't revert or refuse to commit a change that implements the "greenlighted" BIP just because they don't agree with it.

> I think we need to nail this down (even if imperfectly) to make this BIP real. Personally, I think that there should be at least one way to anonymously vote (say by owning coins). But I don't feel that there's any need to preserve anonymity for the other stakeholders. In fact, for some groups I think it would be bad to allow anonymous voters. If you own a bunch of coins, or prove massive mining capacity, there can be no doubt that you are incentivized to vote for what is best for bitcoin. But some vocal forum writer, speaker or professor might not care about Bitcoin's ultimate success, or be a paid shill or sockpuppet. But requiring identity at least these people are putting a little bit of their personal reputation behind their comments. Of course, companies already disclose their identities so no problem there.

> Somehow I missed that in your doc. Your proposal seems ok, although it may be hard to get consensus at those levels. And honestly I think that miners have too much power already -- I think that Bitcoin should be optimizing itself for users not for infrastructure. At the same time, I hope that miners realize that their business model requires consumer users (vs corporate users like bank 2 bank) so will probably vote what they believe is best for consumers..

While BIP-0001 defines the process for writing and submitting a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal to the community it does not specify the precise method for which BIPs are considered accepted or rejected. This proposal sets up a method for determining BIP acceptance.
