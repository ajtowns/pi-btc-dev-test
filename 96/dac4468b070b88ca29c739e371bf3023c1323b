A PoP-enabled fork of Mycelium is available at
https://github.com/kallerosenbaum/wallet and the server (validating
code) is available at https://github.com/kallerosenbaum/poppoc/

There's also a demo site using the server code at
http://www.rosenbaum.se:8080/ and a demo video at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euzZcoCilhc

Mycelium Binaries are also available on the demo site.
