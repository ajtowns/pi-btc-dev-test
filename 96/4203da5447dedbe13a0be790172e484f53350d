Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin is an experiment. Why don't we have an
 experimental hardfork?

And I'm not trying to be a dumdum (whatever that is) when saying that
Bitcoin XT the softfork and BIP101 implemented as a schism hardfork in
Bitcoin XT are different things. One existed before the other. And if
there wasn't a schism hardfork in the making there wouldn't be any
warning about Bitcoin XT in bitcoin.org because Bitcoin XT implemented
the same consensus rules (and I think was largely ignored).
When we say "Bitcoin XT is bad" some users read "Bitcoin Core devs
think any code fork to Bitcoin Core is back because they lose control
over it".
The second is not the case: nobody complained or cared about Bitcoin
XT when it implemented the same consensus rules.

I'm not sure I will learn anything by reading this link (I didn't
reading the previous link).
Have you read BIP99 already? Can you tell me where you disagree with
what's in BIP99 in one of its 2 threads?

Again, I'm against this Schism hardfork but maybe I'm in favor of an
Schism hardfork in the future, I don't know.
We're both against the Schism hardfork but somehow you think I'm in
favor and are trying to change my mind.
What are we even discussing about?

Right now it shouldn't be downloaded because it contains this quite
irrational Schism hardfork.
When it was only a not-up-to-date-bitcoin/master + the commits
(non-consensus changes) Hearn would like to see in Bitcoin Core nobody
was specially worried about it.

So what are we discussing about?
