bitcoin:12345 *is* a "real" URI. It's just not an absolute, hierarchical URI (a.k.a. a URL); rather, it's an opaque URI.

And your suggestion is actually in violation of the URI spec, since "blockhash", "txid", "block", and "address" are not host names.

More correct would be:

blockchain:?blockhash=00000000000000001003e880d500968d51157f210c632e08a652af3576600198
blockchain:?txid=3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a
blockchain:?block=189000
blockchain:?address=1RicMooMWxqKczuRCa5D2dnJaUEn9ZJyn

You should read the URI syntax RFC: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986

The bitcoin: thing leads to additional code to mutate it into a proper URI before passing it to URL parsing. And I think it would be fine to include the type looking up. For example:
