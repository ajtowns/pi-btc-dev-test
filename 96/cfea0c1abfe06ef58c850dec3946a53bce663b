Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Version 0.4 release candidate 1
Message-ID: <CABsx9T2_CfaEoxSjQ4PhRZbsy05HsL+Z9X-ivx1h8GQFJ+=nfg@mail.gmail.com>

Bitcoin version 0.4 release candidate 1 is ready for initial testing;
please grab the source from github and try to break it.

The big, visible change is wallet private key encryption, which is NOT
turned on by default.

The big, invisible change is a reworking of internal critical section
mutexes to fix some chronic problems with bitcoind becoming
unresponsive due to deadlocks.

git shortlog --no-merges v0.3.24..
 ... will give you all the changes.

Thanks to everybody who contributed patches, and sorry if your
favorite patch is not included.
