Message-ID: <CAD2Ti2_Z-mzHu_VG7fq+sgQj7CfdZ_nKoa7Q6nDObwBSL6yXgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Well, detachdb doesn't appear in the -\? help
because it's stuffed under pnp, which is not set
in my build. please fix for people, tx :)

#ifdef USE_UPNP
#if USE_UPNP
            "  -upnp            \t  "   + _("Use Universal Plug and
Play to map the listening port (default: 1)") + "\n" +
#else
            "  -upnp            \t  "   + _("Use Universal Plug and
Play to map the listening port (default: 0)") + "\n" +
#endif
            "  -detachdb        \t  "   + _("Detach block and address
databases. Increases shutdown time (default: 0)") + "\n" +
#endif
