Yes, this was one of my motivations for doing this soon.

It would only require about 2 LOC to have Bitcoin Core vomit out a
blob containing the final alert to any old protocol version peers that
connect.  I don't know how other people would feel about that, but I
wouldn't mind implementing it, and it would greatly improve the
likelihood that they continue to to get once propagation of it is
gone. This could be left in the codebase for a couple years or until
other changes made those old versions p2p incompatible for other
reasons.
