It refers to the external specification which is linked at the bottom.
In that spec you'll see that "Integer" is the standard var-int that Bitcoin 
has used for years.

How does one signals an optional field except of in the spec? Thats the job of 
a specification.

Did you miss this in the 3rd table ?  I suggest clicking on the github bips 
repo link as tables are not easy to read in mediawiki plain format that the 
email contained.

Also in the external CMF spec.

I agree, that would be bad. Luckily that you just missed the link :)
Here it is;

Being hardcoded and never communicated is what the current format does to. How 
does that "remove flexibility".

Also read my reply to Peter Todd on why this is flexible.

It is not.

Thanks for asking, I understand that the CMF spec is useful to see as well. 
Hopefully you can now review it properly since I linked to it above.

Cheers!
