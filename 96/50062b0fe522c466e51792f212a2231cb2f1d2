Building a compressor from scratch may yeild some better compression
ratios, or not, but having trust and faith in whether it will stand up
against attack vectors another matter.  LZO has been around for 20 years
with very few problems and no current issues.  Maybe something better
can be built, but when and how much testing will need to be done before
it can be trusted?  Right now there is something that provides a benefit
and in the future if something better is found it's not that difficult
to add it.  We could easily support multiple compression libraries.
