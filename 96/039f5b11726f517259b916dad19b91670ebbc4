A better solution is to track the failure rate of zero confirmation
transactions, and adjust prices accordingly to cover the expected loss.

This is what every merchant *already does* since no payment method has
a 0% fraud rate.

Even physical cash has a probability of being counterfeit, and the
prices you pay for things at a convenience store already have that
risk priced in.

The idea that zero confirmation transactions require a 100% guarantee
is a strawman, especially since there exists no number of
confirmations the actually produce a 100% irreversibility guarantee.

Zero confirmation transactions can work as long as the risk of
reversal is measurable and reasonably stable.
