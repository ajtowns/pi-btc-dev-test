I'm not sure what your reasoning for this is? If your concern is that
someone starts DoS attacking you with bloom-based attacks, you should
just disconnect them as an attacker, and announce that you support bloom
filtering globally. If you want to serve your own nodes, then I dont
think this BIP doesnt allow you to do so, just needs an implementation.

Trustless (and non-privacy-losing) proposals welcome :)
