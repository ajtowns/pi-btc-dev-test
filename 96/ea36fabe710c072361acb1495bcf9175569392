WIP for TREZOR means that we've made that hard part already (firwmare) so
we know it is feasible, yet we didn't spend enough time on finalizing all
the stack like our web wallet because we don't see any actual release date
yet. Considering current battles on BU hashpower, we decided simply sit and
watch (I already have popocorn).

There're also many wallets which are impatiently waiting for segwit to be
released. Segwit is blessing for hardware wallets for many reasons. I
actually think that rolling out Segwit will increase security, because it
will reduce huge complexity in hardware wallets as it is today.
