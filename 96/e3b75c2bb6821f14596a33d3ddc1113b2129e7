What would you think of an approach like John Dillon's proposal to
explicitly give the economic majority of coin holders a vote for the max
blocksize? Miners could still vote BIP100 style for what max they were
willing to use, limited in turn by the vote of the economic majority.

I think in principle that would give all parties a clear voice in the
matter, which in turn makes whatever the result is more legitimit and
less controversial.
