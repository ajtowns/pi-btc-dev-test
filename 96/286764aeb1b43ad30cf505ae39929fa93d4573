Hi Alex,

I think the problem is with my suggestion to use bind forwarding.. 
basically bind is stripping off the authorative answer bit in the 
reply.. this causes the recursor to go into a loop chasing the authority 
server which again returns a non-authoritve answer with itself as the 
authority again. I'm not sure if this can be fixed without hacking the 
bind src, so maybe it wasn't such a great suggestion in the first place. 
Basically I think if bind was returning authorative answers it would 
work, but I can't see any way to make that happen in the bind 
configuration.

Rob
