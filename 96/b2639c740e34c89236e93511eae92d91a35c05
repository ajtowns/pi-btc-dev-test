Data does not belong in the blockchain. People running nodes have all 
implicitly agreed to store the blocks for financial purposes, and storing data 
is a violation of that social contract. Proof-of-stake may be arguably 
financial, but I'm sure there must be a way to do it without spamming people 
against their consent.

The alternative is to make other standard outputs unable to store data as 
well.
