I am having a bit of difficulty understanding your example.

If graftroot were possible it would mean that the funds were paid to a
public key.  That holder(s) of the corresponding private key could
sign without constraint, and so the accoutability you're expecting
wouldn't exist there regardless of graftroot.

I think maybe your example is only making the case that it should be
possible to send funds constrained by a script without a public key
ever existing at all.  If so, I agree-- but that wasn't the question
here as I understood it.
