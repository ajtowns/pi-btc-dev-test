Qt is not part of the compiler/build environment. Thus we don't need
to resort to those kind of tricks.

As I said: we can easily build against Qt 4.6 instead. As said, that
wouldn't even need building Qt on linux, just unpacking and exporting
the headers.

But indeed we need to decide on a cut-off point. I'd have preferred
4.7 or 4.8. Qt 4.6 is *ancient* - it was released in februari 2010.
Apart from tails it doesn't seem like anyone is using those old stable
distributions on the desktop.
