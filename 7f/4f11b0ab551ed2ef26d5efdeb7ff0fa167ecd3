Well to be fair, nobody suggested 6 billion full nodes.  Although some 
residential connections today do have Angel's 15G/10min... (sadly, not

One of the best points Gavin made is, it would be unwise to artificially 
limit the number of transactions below the technical capabilities of the 
network.  That's how competitions are lost.
