small nit with 3.

It seems to me that the wallet would perform initial discovery on m/44
and m/49, and then would find transactions at one or the other, so it
can then record the type somewhere and from then on need only monitor
one branch.

Still, I agree it is ugly, makes initial discovery up to 2x slower, etc.

speaking as author of tools hd-wallet-addrs and hd-wallet-derive, I
agree this is problematic.

would be great if xpub/xprv could somehow encode their absolute path in
wallet for tools to read.  Users cannot be expected to know.
