Personally I think once the blocksize arguments are solved, there will
be no more contentious changes for this voting system to deal with.
What other contentious issues have come up in the past 3 years or so
that wasn't blocksize/scaling related? Do other protocols like TCP/IP
and the HTTP protocol have developers arguing every day over issues no
one can agree on?
