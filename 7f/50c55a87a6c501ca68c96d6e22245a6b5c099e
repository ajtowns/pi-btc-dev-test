Hello again,

block 000000000000015c50b165fcdd33556f8b44800c5298943ac70b112df480c023
(height=225430) seems indeed to have cause pre-0.8 and 0.8 nodes to fork
(at least mostly). Both chains are being mined on - the 0.8 one growing
faster.

After some emergency discussion on #bitcoin-dev, it seems best to try to
get the majority mining power back on the "old" chain, that is, the one
which 0.7 accepts
(with 00000000000001c108384350f74090433e7fcf79a606b8e797f065b130575932 at
height 225430). That is the only chain every client out there will accept.
BTC Guild is switching to 0.7, so majority should abandon the 0.8 chain
soon.

Short advice: if you're a miner, please revert to 0.7 until we at least
understand exactly what causes this. If you're a merchant, and are on 0.8,
stop processing transactions until both sides have switched to the same
chain again. We'll see how to proceed afterwards.
