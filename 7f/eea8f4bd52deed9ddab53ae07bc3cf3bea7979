Nobody is exactly thrilled by IsStandard, but it's not a deal-killer. If
you have a use for a new type of script it can be added, and people do
upgrade:

As you can see the 0.9 rollout is going OK. If a new script type had been
made standard for 0.9 like OP_RETURN was, I'm guessing it'll only be
another month or so and it'll be quite usable.
