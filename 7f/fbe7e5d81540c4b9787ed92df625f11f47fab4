The bandwidth/latency argument is solid.  And if a block encodes to <
~3k, then we can just spray it to (some?) peers rather than using INV.

But validation is only trivially cachable if the delta to the previous
weak block is zero.  The "partially validated" cases need to be coded
with care (eg. total opcode constraints, tx order).

I was thinking as a first cut we do the opposite: don't validate weak
blocks at all (other than PoW), and just use them as a bandwidth
optimization.

Ambition is good though!

Chers,
Rusty.
PS.  Original idea came to me from Greg Maxwell; Peter Todd called it
     "near blocks" and extolled their virtues 2 years ago...
