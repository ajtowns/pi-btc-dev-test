It's not future. It's presently allowed in blocks. Which means it's perfectly 
valid to relay (and also perfectly value to NOT relay or accept). Ergo, 
shouldn't be punished.

Um, no? It implies you have 99 blocks since the coinbase, and he has 100 and 
wants to spend. In this scenario, it's proper to reject his transaction *until 
you have the next block*, but it doesn't make sense to punish for it.
