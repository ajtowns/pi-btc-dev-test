different type of validation?

If you're running an SPV node that is listening to full nodes on the
network, you can request an unconfirmed transaction from connected peers
after receiving the inventory message they send - that's how unconfirmed
transactions propagate through the node network. This is not 100% proof
that the transaction is valid for inclusion in the blockchain, but it's a
very good indicator.
