Just want to clarify two points:

This change has not yet appeared in any released software (but I assume it
will be in the next release, 0.14.0).

I agree that the performance optimization is not the point of this change;
I can modify the BIP draft to de-emphasize that further (perhaps remove
mention of it entirely).
