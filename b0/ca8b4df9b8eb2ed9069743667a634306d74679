As good of an idea as it may or may not be to remove this feature from the code base, actually doing so would be crossing a boundary that we have not previously been willing to do except under extraordinary duress. The nature of bitcoin is such that we do not know and cannot know what transactions exist out there pre-signed and making use of these features.

It may be a good idea to make these features non standard to further discourage their use, but I object to doing so with the justification of eventually disabling them for all transactions. Taking that step has the potential of destroying value and is something that we have only done in the past either because we didn?t understand forks and best practices very well, or because the features (now disabled) were fundamentally insecure and resulted in other people?s coins being vulnerable. This latter concern does not apply here as far as I?m aware.

Actually, FindAndDelete() would only be triggered in some weird edge cases like using out-of-range SIGHASH_SINGLE.

Note that in BIP143, only executed OP_CODESEPARATOR are removed so it doesn?t have the FindAndDelete()-like function. OP_CODESEPARATOR in segwit scripts are useful for Tumblebit so it is not disabled in this proposal
