The payment request message is just as one-way as an address is. It is
already being emailed and printed on an invoice, in fact it often acts
as the invoice.

Even more problematic, if you were to include an expiry date in a
BIP-173 address and put that into a payment request, wallets wouldn't be
allowed to parse that expiry date from the script without violating the
BIP70 spec.
