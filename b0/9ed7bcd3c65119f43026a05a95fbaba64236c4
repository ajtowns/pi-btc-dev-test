I agree in concept with everything you've said here, but I think there's a
frequent misconception that there's a certain level of miner payouts that
miners "deserve" and/or the opposite, that miners "deserve" as little as
possible.  The 51% attacks that PoW's shields us from are relatively well
defined, which can be used to estimate the minimum amount of sustainable
fees for shielding.  Beyond that minimum amount of fees, the best amount of
fees for every non-miner is the lowest.

Unfortunately miners could arbitrarily decide to limit blocksizes, and
there's little except relay restrictions that everyone else could do about
it.  Fortunately miners so far have pushed for blocksize increases at least
as much as anyone else, though the future when Bitcoin adoption stabilizes
would be an unknown.

FYI, I don't see this happening again ever, barring brief exceptions,
unless there was a sudden blocksize change, which ideally we'd avoid ever
happening.  The stable average value of the transaction fee determines what
kind of business use-cases can be built using Bitcoin.  An average fee of
$0.001 usd enables a lot more use cases than $0.10 average fees, and $50.00
average fees still have far more possible use cases than a $1000 average
fee.  If fees stabilize low, use cases will spring up to fill the
blockspace, unless miners arbitraily seek to keep the fees above some level.
