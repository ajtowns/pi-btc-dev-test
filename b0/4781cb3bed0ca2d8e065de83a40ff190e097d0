The exact same way you're proposing: via the payment protocol.

If something goes wrong and a payment gets lost, that's where you
implement a last-ditch "scan for stealth payments" button or similar
that either just asks a semi-trusted server to scan the blockchain for
you, or accepts the bandwidth hit and does so itself. (note that the
scan pubkey used to find payments is unable to spend those payments)
