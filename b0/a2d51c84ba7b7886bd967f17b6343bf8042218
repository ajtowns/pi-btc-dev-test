Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Lost proposals from FellowTraveler/Monetas
Message-ID: <CAAS2fgRKFTVu-rzr9spQZtMBrV0oGYmWVbiAOOhxkW4NnuzjHg@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any discussion thats been had relating to the BIP-drafts at:

https://github.com/Open-Transactions/rfc/tree/master/bips

Fellow Traveler has apparently been waiting 9 months for progress on
these proposals and I'm trying to find out where the breakdown
happened. While do not doubt that I am somehow at fault, I can't
figure out how.

Searching my email and this list archive for "Base58 Serialization for
Transaction-Based Color Descriptors" or "Order-based Smart Property
Coloring" or the draft names bip-ccids, etc. turn up no hits at all.
I've asked several other people and there list archives show nothing.

Has anyone else taken part in discussions related to these proposals
(or seen them all before)? If so, please point me to the discussion.

Otherwise I'll just go ahead and create threads for each under the
assumption that there is yet another mailing list screwup. :(
