I think it was probably a design requirement more than a demand. It makes 
sense: if we're aiming to have a long lead time for a possible hardfork, we 
want to get the lead time started ASAP. (It could perhaps have been 
communicated clearer, but let's not read hostility into things when 
unnecessary.)

Meta-topic: Can we try a little harder to avoid sequences of multiple brief 
replies in a matter of minutes? Combine them to a single reply.
