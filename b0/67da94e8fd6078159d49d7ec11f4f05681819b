"Invoice number" is still too coarse-grained.

If anyone cared about user privacy, then whatever was supplied to
users as an "invoice number" would be a BIP32 extended public key, or
something equivalent to that, which would allow the payer to create as
many unique addresses as they needed to avoid merging inputs.

Also, from a business accounting perspective it's broken and wrong to
assume a 1:1 relationship between payment transactions and invoices
anyway:
