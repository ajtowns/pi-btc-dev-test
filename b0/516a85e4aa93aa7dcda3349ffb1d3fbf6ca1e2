I agree with you in theory, each miner could decide their inclusion rules
for themselves.

In practice, if the reference client is updated, then most miners will
accept those transactions.  In addition, it would eventually propagate to
alt-coins (or at least the supported ones).

I could simply submit the changes as a pull request for the reference
client, but I was hoping that by doing it this way, it would increase the
odds of it being accepted.

I don't think it quite requires the same coordination in the short term.  I
could write up the sequence as an info BIP.

The malleability "issue" has been known for years.

It is possible to tweak the protocol so that it still works.  However, it
means that 3rd parties are required (that could go in the BIP too).

Implementing multi-P2SH gets a lot of the benefits of MAST, in terms of
efficiency.

Not yet, but that is just my personal repo.  I did email gmaxwell, but he
said that they can't be assigned until some discussion has happened.

I take your point that the name appears in the link though, so could cause
issues with searching.
