I'm assuming there are literally ZERO miners left on the weaker branch.
The attacker in this scenario simply rents hashing for a few days in advance 
to build his fake chain, then broadcasts the blocks to the unsuspecting 
merchant at ~10 block intervals so it looks like everything is working normal 
again. There are lots of mining rental services out there, and miners quite 
often do not care to avoid selling hashrate to the highest bidder regardless 
of what they're mining. 10 blocks worth costs a little more than 250 BTC - 
soon, that will be 125 BTC.
