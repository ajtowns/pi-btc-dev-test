This is a very complex way to enter zombie mode.

A simpler way is to track valid PoW chains by examining only the header, that
are rejected for other reasons.

Once a chain is seen to be 6 or more blocks ahead of my chain tip, we should
enter "zombie mode" and refuse to mine or relay, and alert the operator, because
we don't know what we're doing and we're out of date.  This way doesn't require
any modifications to block structure at all.
