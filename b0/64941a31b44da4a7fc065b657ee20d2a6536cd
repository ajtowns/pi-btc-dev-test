Thank you for all your comments. To sum up:

- There were no comments related to the implementation details.
- There are concerns about this may incentivize users to use copypaste
functionality extensively.
- A counter argument was made that crypto hijackers use the clipboard,
because that is the most convenient thing to hijack, not because they can
only hijack that and, if Bitcoin users would move to other ways of
specifying destinations, that may end up being just as an issue, too.
- The rest of the conversation was about crypto hijackers, which I think is
off topic in this thread.

Finally I'd like to note, there's already a work in progress implementation
in Wasabi: https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pull/825
