Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin network simulation testing?
Message-ID: <CAOVG1oNimYpzSnB7NUuugagufbD1JnZmAWsuXhMjq45dEF=w-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, is anyone using simulators like Shadow (https://shadow.github.io),
BTCSim (https://github.com/btcsuite/btcsim), etc. to test proposed changes
to Bitcoin?  I have a few questions about their capabilities and
limitations.
