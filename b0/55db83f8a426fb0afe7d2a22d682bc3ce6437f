If you are talking about user interface, I don't think you have to be
technically correct. It must make sense to the user.
A user cares about his balance, and did a payment "go through", and "did my
payment arrive/clear".

The UI is for their benefit.

Maybe, but again from the user's perspective they pay someone, and they
receive money - just like you do with paypal using an email address.
The technical bits in the middle dont matter to the user and trying to crap
stuff in to be technically correct is just confusing to them.

The UI needs to be about the user and fit with his experience of the world.
