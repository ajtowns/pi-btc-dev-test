Still, it would have meant that all 0.8 users would have immediatley
been told that something was wrong.  I don't know to what extent it
was luck that this was dealt with as promptly and efficiently as it

shouting in various places "wtf is going on" couldn't but help in
reducing the element of luck if something similar were to happen again.
