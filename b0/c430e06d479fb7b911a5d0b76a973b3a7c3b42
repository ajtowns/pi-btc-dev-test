Hi All

I enuired about this and got the following reply, from the chair of the
crypto group:

[[
Just email public-webcrypto-comments at w3.org. It's a public list. Do
definitely mention your use-cases!

I think there's issues of whether NSS etc. already support it. I think the
answer here is "no" but David can clarify. The goal is not to get browser
vendors to write new crypto code, but to expose the crypto code that
already exists.

We still have an open issue about whether "experimental" registry for
identifiers for say, new curves that aren't in the core spec, will be
maintained. So, maybe if browsers don't support it today, it's always
possible they might want to support it tomorrow given Bitcoin's growth.
]]

Please let me know if anyone has a use case for ecdsa in the browser let me
know.

Or if anyone would like to write to the public list that's fine

Otherwise I'll just fire off a mail and see what they come back with ...
