How do you trust your <1000 block blockchain if you don't
download/validate the whole thing? (I know it should be easy to spot
that by looking at the blocks/tx or comparing to other nodes, but from a
programmatic point of view this is much harder). You can of course
include a checkpoint in the code to tell which recent block is valid
(which is already done afaik), but you still need all blocks from that
checkpoint to validate the chain (not 10!). If you rely on such
checkpoint, why not just include the UTXO's as well so you can start
mid-way based on code trust?

Indeed pruning doesn't allow you to start mid-way yet but there are much
easier solutions to that than what you propose.
