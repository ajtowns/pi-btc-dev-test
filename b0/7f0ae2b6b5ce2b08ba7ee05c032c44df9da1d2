On that note, this 2003 example of an attempt to backdoor the Linux
kernel is pertinent:

http://lwn.net/Articles/57135/

The backdoor in question came down to a single missing character,
easily overlooked by a reviewer if a spotlight hadn't been thrown on
it for other reasons. Compromising a Bitcoin implementation isn't
going to be as easy as that, one would hope, but certainly it seems
only a matter of time until there's an attempt at it.

Following these code review discussions with much interest.
