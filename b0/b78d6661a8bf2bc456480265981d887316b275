This depends on how long you expect to keep money on a side chain and how
many transactions you plan on doing.   Inflation is a great way of paying
PoS / PoB  miners - that cannot introduce issues with consolidation.   If
you design the inflation schedule correctly, it should be balance
transaction costs *precisely*.   Indeed, you can calculate the exact amount
of inflation needed to guarantee that a side chain is always exactly 10
times cheaper than bitcoin.

>As I posted to bitcoin-discuss last week, I support UTXO commitments for
sidechains.

Indeed, I think side chain nodes should always be fast-synced from 6 month
old commitments and thus be ephemeral, cheap, and *never *appropriate for
long term storage.  This would provide the best possible incentive
structure to keep the main chain secure, paid for with high clearing fees,
etc.

incentive structure

The critical issue is that we cannot introduce protocol changes that
*further *incentivize geographical and institutional consolidation.  Miners
who are able to deal with the bandwidth caused by drivechain coffee
transactions will profit from these transactions, whereas smaller and more
geographically distributed miners will not.   Those miners will, in turn,
build faster ASICs and buy more electricity and drive out smaller players.
  I think this is *abundantly *clear, and is the primary motivation behind
preserving block size limits.

If this premise is false (which it may be), or is skewed so as to damage
bitcoin as a whole (could be as well), then that needs to be demonstrated
*first*.

The lightning model does the opposite of this.   Miners watch fees increase
and coming from an *orthoganal* protocol that cannot cause further
centralization.

One problem is that the main chain also *must* grow in response to
bandwidth, or the disadvantages of using the main chain will weaken
financial support and hashrate securing it.   I believe this is also true,
and that a "balancing act" will be Bitcoin's norm until we adopt something
like BIP103 - which provides a steady and appropriate growth.
