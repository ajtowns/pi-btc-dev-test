If one's goal is to mess with an transaction to prevent it from being
mined, it is more effective to just not relay the transaction rather than
to mess with the witness.  Given two transactions with the same txid and
different witness data, miners and good nodes ought to mine/relay the
version with the lower cost (smaller?) witness data.

Worries about "illegal data" appearing in the blockchain is not an issue
worth writing a soft-fork over.

There may be good reasons for this BIP, but I don't think the reasons give
above are good.
