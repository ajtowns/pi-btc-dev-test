Just to let you know, Bitcoin Wallet for Android already supports
directly sending transactions via NFC and QR-Code. Currently, receiving
such a transaction is handled the same way as if it was received via P2P.

This means the sender does not need to have internet access the moment
he pays. The transaction is being broadcast into the P2P network by the
receiver.

Cheers,
