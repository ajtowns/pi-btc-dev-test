Subject: [Bitcoin-development] mailing list to get news ONLY about new
	releases
Message-ID: <CAHCALeyT9oRZCPGbOcHJLai5k-ga8VrpaXL_1YmgFs2knik4jw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone.

Is there a mailing list where I can get only notifications about NEW
releases of bitcoin-qt client?

So far I've found only RSS subscription here:
https://bitcoin.org/en/rss/releases.rss

RSS is not convinient at all for me..

Many thanks.
