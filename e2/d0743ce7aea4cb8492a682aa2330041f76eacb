If the Schism fork goes wrong (ie 2 chains coexist in parallel for
long) the result may as well be that NOBODY will be left any value.
Both the majority and the minority can lose simultaneusly.
See https://github.com/jtimon/bips/blob/bip-forks/bip-forks.org#schism1-hardforks
That kind of hardfork is basically like forcing the users to go to war
against each other.
Really, I don't think civil war is an exaggerated analogy.

That sounds great. Do you have any proposal in mind?
I really want hardforks to be made, I just don't want to kill the
system attempting it.
