A lot of this detail and worry is eliminated by simply asking BIP 102
maintainers to change to a different bit that works best for everyone.
Existing nVersion garbage will get buried in sufficient time window to
prevent anything from triggering.

Just settle on a specific standard, reserve bits for feature upgrade forks,
and move on.  There is already a rough standard proposed in sipa's gist.
