I didn't mention the block size limit; weak blocks are a good idea no matter the limit.

As for miners paying for the work: lots of companies contributed to the Foundation, and will contribute to the DCI. When there are big, stable, profitable companies I think we'll see them task their developers to contribute code.

I think optimizing new block propagation is interesting and important, so I plan on working on it.
