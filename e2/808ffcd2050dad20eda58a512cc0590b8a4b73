As for what "SPV mining" is:

While blocks are propagating throughout the network, frequently it's
possible for miners to get the header of the block before they get and
fully validate the block itself. This is just a few seconds to tens of
seconds, but that's a big deal for profitability. So miners have been
running custom patches that mine on top of the longest chain they know
about, even if they haven't actually verified the blocks in it due to
propagation delays.

Unfortunately the Bitcoin protocol lets you do that, and the extra % of
revenue makes a big difference when you take into account the low profit
margins of mining these days. BIP66 happened to trigger this issue this
time, but actually *any* miner creating an invalid block for *any*
reason would have done so with the software miners are running right
now.
