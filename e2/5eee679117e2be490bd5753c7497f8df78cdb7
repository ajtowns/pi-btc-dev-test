Subject: [bitcoin-dev] How much is too much time between difficulty changes?
Message-ID: <CAGLBAhdtXEjhZWavgytQAOuXUaJZc=ZQyvjB2KV-YczAh-H4WQ@mail.gmail.com>

The last difficulty change took about 20% longer than expected.  How large
does the time between difficulty changes have to get for us to make
changes?  In other words, if, at some point, block confirmation times are
averaging, say, hours or days, will we hardfork to speed things up?

One option is NO.  When enough economic interests align to amass the
computing power to get important bitcoin transactions into a block, then
they will work out a way to get that block confirmed.  This allows other
cryptocurrencies and technologies like LN to fill in.

There may be a group that will fork the code in order to adjust the
difficulty more rapidly, and bitcoin holders will put a value on
bitcoin-FDA ("Faster-Difficuly-Adjustment"), which is fine with me.  We can
learn how to fork peacefully from what we learned when BCH was born, and
what we learned when it split.

I think some insight into how core developers will handle increasing
demands to use faster difficulty adjustments (if they respond at all) will
be helpful, and this is why I'm asking.
