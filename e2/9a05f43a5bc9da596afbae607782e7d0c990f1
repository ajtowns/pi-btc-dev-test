Treating the pool block withholding attack as a weapon has bad
connotations, and I don't think anyone directly condones such an attack.
Nevertheless, the mere possibility of the attack could drive miners away
from those overly-large open pools.

As for masquerading as multiple small pools -- that's a very good point,
with a surprising answer: it doesn't really matter. An attacker attacks all
parts of the open pool proportionally to their size, and the result is
basically identical to that of attacking a single large pool.

All that being said -- it's not great to rely on the potential of attacks
and on threats against the honest large pools out there (including GHash,
which, afaik, did nothing more wrong than being successful).

Best,
Ittay
