This sounds similar to the "bitcoin2" branch I created a while back - 
basically a "next"-like branch, but for hardforking changes that refused to 
run without the -testnet option. There's so much non-hardforking code that can 
be written/tested, at this point, that I think it was and maybe is premature 
to be writing hardforking code outside of necessity. But perhaps if you want 
to play around, it might be a good starting point (it can probably merge up to 
latest master, and trivial to rebase if not).
