That's a perfect example of why fraud proofs aren't as secure as expected: the miner who created such a block wouldn't even give you the data necessary to prove the fraud in the first place.

What you actually need are validity challenges, where someone makes a challenge claiming that part of the block is invalid. A failure to meet the challenge with proof that the rules are followed is considered defacto evidence of fraud.

But validity challenges don't scale well and pose DoS attacks issues; it's far from clear that they can be implemented in a useful way. Even if validity challenges work, they also don't solve censorship: a world of nodes in large datacenters is a world where it's very easy to force the few Bitcoin nodes remaining to follow AML/KYC rules for instance, a risk we wouldn't be able to mitigate with a PoW change.
