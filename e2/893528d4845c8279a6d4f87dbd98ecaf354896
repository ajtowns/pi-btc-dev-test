Should do (unless BIP 16 broke something). In fact both the GUI and
RPC commands use CBitcoinAddress and IsValid to validate addresses in
that way.

Again, should do, and it's used by the RPC commands for sending
Bitcoins as well. Really there's not a lot that needs to be changed.
I'm pretty sure even the change in MaxAddressLength is only necessary
to send coins to multisig addresses on testnet, sending them on
mainnet should just work.
