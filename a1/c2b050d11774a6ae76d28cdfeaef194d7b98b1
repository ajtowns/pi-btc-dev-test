Thanks for the patch and the detective work!

Enabling dynamic libs was on my TODO, but on the Redmond_OS_not_to_be_mentioned you need to :
* prepend class definitions with __declspec(dllexport) when you compile the dll
* prepend class definitions with __declspec(dllimport) when you use the dll
I just love the way they spoil their developers...

I have the framework to automate this with CMake from a former project, but I havn't tested it for libcoin yet, hence the static build. And well, iOS also has this fetich for static libs.

I also recall another issue with dll's: If you define a global variable it is shared between all executables using this dll. I have still a handful of globals to clean out, namely those related to logging - I will do so, but it has not yet been a top priority. 

So, feel free to use dynamic libs on unix'es, but on windows it is .libs for a little while longer.

Will fix the Qt stuff in CMake - thanks!

Cheers,

Michael
