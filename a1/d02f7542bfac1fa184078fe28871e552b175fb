What you describe is not a fix of replay attack. By confirming the same tx in both network, the tx has been already replayed. Their child txs do not matter.

The new fork has to accept these transactions, as there is no guarantee that the existing fork would survive nor maintain any value. People made time-locked transactions in anticipation that they would be accepted later. In order to maximise the value of such transactions, the only way is to make them accepted by any potential hardforks.

It also means that all wallet clients either needs to be updated OR paired with software that intercepts generated transactions, and automatically generates the correct follow-up transaction for it (old network only).
