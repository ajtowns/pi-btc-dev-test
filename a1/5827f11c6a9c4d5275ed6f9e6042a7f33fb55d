Good standard must be explicit as much as possible. Having million optional
fields with ambiguous meaning is even worse than not having these fields.

HTTP status codes are good example. There are hundreds of them, still
applications understands just few of them, because other have ambiguous
meaning and software don't know how to handle them.

Good example of such over-engineering is also XMPP. XMPP has milions
extensions and features, but look at Jabber clients; call yourself lucky
when you can send messages and files, although there're various extensions
like searching for contacts (something which has be working in ICQ decade
ago), voice support, end to end encryption or alerting users. These
features are defined, but not widely implemented, because its definition is
vague or the feature is abused because of poor design.

Please don't over-engineer payment protocol.

Thank you for your attention.
