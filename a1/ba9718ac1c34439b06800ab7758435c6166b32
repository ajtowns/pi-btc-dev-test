Hi everybody!!

 This is my first message here... I'm ThiagoCMC at bitcointalk...

 Well, one of the features that I like most is that, every time I receive
some Bitcoin amount, a new address appear at my "AddressBook"automatically,
AND, I like to track it.

 This feature is broken at 0.3.24 but it is working again! Thanks BTW!!

 But, I've read in some places that you guys are thinking in disable this
feature... Is that true?!

 PLEASE, do NOT deactivate this feature! I mean, do not deactivate ANY
feature. Instead of, just add a option to turn it ON and OFF. Right?!  ^^

 Bitcoin is the most amazing project since Linux and Git!!  :-P

 Thank you guys!!

Best,
Thiago
