Oh and I realised I stuffed up the subject and it talks about the addr relay but I actually answered my own question on the addr relaying, I had just miss interpreted one document I thought it was talking about subtracting 2 hours before relaying but I see we subtract 2 hours on receipt not relay?because the if it hadn't been seen for 60 minutes previously it now becomes 3 hours and we use but don't relay makes sense.

  Hi, plugging away at my C# Bitcoin node "Lego.NET" Thashiznets/Lego.NET now I am currently working on addr relaying. I am as we speak wiring up my DB in Azure, and ready to start plopping net_addrs in my DB, all good however I'm reading two different specification docs that seem to be wildly varying. I mean the first one here Developer Reference - Bitcoin?didn't mention that version message now has the 4 byte checksum and no?time in the net_addrs?and I was getting reject malformed?messages until I found the other document which informed me we now use the 4 byte checksum in version and no time in the net-addrs in version message. So?I solved that and here is the other doco. I have found other variances like one document said that the heartbeat AND disconnect were 30 minutes, but then in the other document I read that Heartbeat is 30 minutes and disconnect is 90 minutes which seems far more sensible so I went with that and modified my code. Is there any other variations between these two spec docos?that perhaps some of you devs know about that I need to look out for! Thanks! Shizzle.
