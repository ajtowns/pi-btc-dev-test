I agree doing it out-of-band is the easiest solution for people who need
this privacy right now, but I do like the idea of adding this feature as
the number of SPV wallets is going to increase. I think the best way to
organize things would be to give encrypted messages their own port number,
similar to how http vs. https works.

We don't want two networks to develop, separated by which nodes support
encryption and which don't, so ideally nodes would rebroadcast messages
they receive on both (encrypted and non-encrypted) channels. This would
essentially double the required bandwidth of the network, which is
something to think about.
