Miners not being crazy does not mean they are infallible.  They may
misjudge the market and change their minds about what is the most
reasonable action based on new information.  Their commitment to one fork
or another is very dynamic, and is a huge assumption missing.  They may
overestimate their influence, support of the economy.  Other factors may
come into play that no one thought of, and they can revert back at any
point.

Labeling things as insane or crazy is not productive.

miners are 'honest.'
