It would certainly be nice to start with a document that reflects the
new REST interface.  That makes a good starting point for further
discussion.

In general the interface exports what information is already
available.  As Wladimir notes, there is no plan to turn this into a
full fledged block explorer, if that implies adding indices etc.

Feedback on the HTTP headers and form, and additional thoughts &
proposals are welcome.  My pull request is intended to present
something minimal, that is easy to review and merge.  My own list of
further to-dos includes

* last-modified and etag headers
* export UTXOs a la Mike Hearn's getutxos query
* eventually rebuild the RPC server to something multithreaded a la
