It could be implemented in other ways, but nSequence is the neatest and
most straightforward I've seen.

- I'm not aware of any other (even vague) proposal for its use?  Enlighten?
- BIP68 reserves much of it for future use already.

If we apply infinite caution we could never use nSequence, as there
might be a better use tommorrow.

Cheers,
Rusty.
