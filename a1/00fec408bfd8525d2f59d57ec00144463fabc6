I never said something was approved by garzik added something after it 
was opposed.  What I said was a proposal was made and 4 people commented 
on the Github.  He then tweeted there was near universal approval before 
most people even heard about the subject.  It was not controversial but 
i was pointing out the arrogance of some of the developers.  He 
considers the entire universe of Bitcoin stakeholders to be a very small 
group of insiders, not the entire universe of Bitcoin users.  Another 
thing I have seen on Github for bitcoin.org is how some the maintainers 
change the rules on the fly.  Sometimes they say a proposal had no 
objections so it is approved.  Other times they say a proposal has no 
support so it is rejected.

You are also trying to say that the core developers actually have little 
influence and are not "deciders" because anyone can fork the code.  That 
has already been discussed at length and such an argument is faulty 
because there is a constraint that your software is incompatible with 
everyone else.  The issue is that there is no way right now to change 
the consensus rules except to go through the core maintainer unless you 
get everybody on the network to switch to your fork.  People who keep 
repeating that the software development is "decentralized because you 
fork the code" without explaining the constraints are just cultists.

The discussion has nothing to do with who has the position now and I 
never said he has "control over the consensus rules."  The maintainer 
has a very large influence way beyond anyone else.  As for your claim 
that I want someone hurt because I am explaining the process, that is 
ridiculous.  If the Core maintainers did not have significant influence 
to change the consensus rules then everybody would not be spending all 
this time lobbying them to have them changed.

The outside influences and stake of the developer is a relevant topic.  
The same types of things are discussed on this list all the time in the 
context of miners, users, merchants, and exchanges.  Again, the 
developers try to place themselves on some kind of pedestal where they 
are the protectors and pure and everyone else (miners, users, merchants) 
are abusers, spammers, attackers, scammers, cheaters, etc.  It is Garzik 
who voluntarily made an issue of how many bitcoins he holds and he made 
that issue in the same place where he announces many of the technical 
issues.  It is very relevant that he has a minimal stake in Bitcoin 
holdings yet he goes around making major decisions about Bitcoin and 
trying to dictate who is allowed to participate in discussions.  If a 
core developer has minimal stake in Bitcoin yet has major veto power 
over code change that is a problem.

You are correct that you cannot give power to any person over the 
Internet which is why some kind of process needs to be developed that 
does not involve trying to convince one person to make the changes or a 
system that depends on unwritten, ever-changing rules maintained by a 
handful of people.
