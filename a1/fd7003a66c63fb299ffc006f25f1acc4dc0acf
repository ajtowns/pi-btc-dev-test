Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP147 minor error
Message-ID: <CAKzdR-pk6WHRkKWHxkTtPps+fXn9VBnJiMf-9vRCmg=O1JODfw@mail.gmail.com>

The BIP147 reads:

*Sigop cost* is defined. The cost of a sigop in traditional script is 4,
while the cost of a sigop in witness program is 1.

The new rule is total *sigop cost* ? 80,000.

But the code implements:
if (nSigOps + (nWitSigOps + 3) / 4 > MAX_BLOCK_SIGOPS)
 ... error....

Which is not the same.

For example:
nSigOps = 1
nWitSigOps =79999

Is not an error by BIP definition but it's an error by the implemented code.

Regards, Sergio.
