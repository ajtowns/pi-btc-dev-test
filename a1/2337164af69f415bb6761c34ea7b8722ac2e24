Hey,

I just saw this added to the clients page. One of the conditions we set for that page was that all the clients must have the entire sourcecode available for review, and users should be able to run it from the sourcecode. Is the sourcecode for this client available for review? I couldn't find it.

Otherwise, we should make a separate section for non-opensource clients.
