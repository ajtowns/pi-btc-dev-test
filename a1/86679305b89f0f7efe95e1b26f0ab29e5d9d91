Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 68 (Relative Locktime) bug
Message-ID: <55994696.1090705@thinlink.com>

BIP 68 uses nSequence to specify relative locktime, but nSequence also
continues to condition the transaction-level locktime.

This dual effect will prevent a transaction from having an effective
nLocktime without also requiring at least one of its inputs to be mined
at least one block (or one second) ahead of its parent.

The fix is to shift the semantics so that nSequence = MAX_INT - 1
specifies 0 relative locktime, rather than 1.  This change will also
preserve the semantics of transactions that have already been created
with the specific nSequence value MAX_INT - 1 (for example all
transactions created by the bitcoin core wallet starting in 0.11).
