Like 640kb should be enough for everyone...  Unfortunately the world doesn't 
like things that can be bigger not getting bigger. ;)

The real advantage of Bitcoin is simpler; its the first system that is not 
owned and possible to subvert that actually works.
All existing attempts before Bitcoin are companies that try to benefit from 
being in the middle, to the exclusion of everyone else and to the exclusion of 
innovation.

Thats circular arguing.  This didn't actually add anything to the 
conversation.

The insight you skip over is that that Bitcoin's advantage, and the concept of 
distributed computing in general, has is one of ownership and control.

If you want to keep Bitcoin small at 1Mb, do you still reach your goal of 
being free from ownership and control? With our excellent growth trends; 
transactions have to go somewhere, they will not use Bitcoin if we don't have 
space. And that means we loose decentralization, we lose avoidance of 
ownership of the network and we introduce control.

All your rhetoric is missing this basic point; is holding Bitcoin at 1Mb 
advancing it, or hurting that basic goal of avoiding ownership?
