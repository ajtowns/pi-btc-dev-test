I've built a shell around the bitcoind JSON-RPC, along with a websockets server that provides realtime transaction and block feeds which can be used with bitcoin mainnet and testnet as well as any of the alt chains and formats it similar to blockchain.info with the bootstrap look-and-feel, i.e. http://altcoins.ws/dogecoin/

A goal of this project was simplicity in deployment to a new server.

The JSON-RPC is missing address indexing and an "unspent" API, so these things are still missing from this shell.
