You keep repeating this smear. Please stop.

If you would actually bother reading the threads where this was
discussed previously you will see that there was significant interest
from bitcoin developers to eventually commit an output filter, and a
significant investment of effort in improving the proposal to that
end.  It is really disheartening to see you continue to repeat your
negative assumptions about other people's wishes when you haven't even
invested the time required to read their words.
