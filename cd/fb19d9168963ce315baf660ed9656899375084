This is horribly under-specified (ie not possible to implement from what
you've written, and your implementation doesn't match at all, last I heard).

This is not a protocol change. I have no idea why you included it in the
"specification" section.

This is not a hard fork, simply adding a new limit is a soft fork. You
appear to be confused - as originally written, AFAIR, Jeff's btc1 branch
did not increase the block size, your specification here matches that
original change, and does not increase the block size.

There is no hard fork, and this would violate consensus rules. Not sure
what you mean. If you do add a hard fork to this BIP, you really need to
flip the hard fork bit.

This is far from sufficient to protect from DoS attacks, you really
should take a look through the mailing list archives and read some of
the old discussions on the issues here.
