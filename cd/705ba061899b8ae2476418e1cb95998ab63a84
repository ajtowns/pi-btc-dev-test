Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Optimization of Codes for Electrum
Message-ID: <KL1PR04MB12222FA12067384DA1164308D8590@KL1PR04MB1222.apcprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Dear Bitcoin-Dev,

I?m writing in to enquire on the post (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-July/002916.html) and I?d like to seek your help and understanding on the codes you modified in order to optimize the syncing of blockchain. For instance, the functions that you modified/variables/values that may lead to a better performance. I?m currently working on further optimising Electrum in terms of syncing and any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you and I really look forward to your prompt reply soon.

Regards,
Daryl
