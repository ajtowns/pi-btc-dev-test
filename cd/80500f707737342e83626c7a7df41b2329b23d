Interesting. I have implemented OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY in a different way from the Elements. Instead of hashing the data on stack, I directly put the 32 byte hash to the stack. This should be more flexible as not every system are using double-SHA256

Both of these op codes are already available in the Elements Alpha sidechain, so it is possible to construct covenants in Elements Alpha today.  I have detailed how the construction works in a blog post at <https://blockstream.com/2016/11/02/covenants-in-elements-alpha.html <https://blockstream.com/2016/11/02/covenants-in-elements-alpha.html>>.  As an example, I've constructed scripts for the Moeser-Eyal-Sirer vault.
