Don't assume that because it does not (frequently) happen, that it cannot
happen. Large amounts of malleated transactions have happened in the past.
Especially if you build a system depends on non-malleability for its
security, you may at some point have an attacker who has financial gain
from malleation.

In theory, yes, anyone can alter the txid without invalidating it, without
mining power and without access to the sender's private keys.

All it requires is seeing a transaction on the network, doing a trivial
modification to it, and rebroadcasting it quickly. If the modifies version
gets mined, you're out of luck. Having mining power helps of course.

After BIP62, you will, as a sender, optionally be able to protect others
from malleating. You're always able to re-sign yourself.
