Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin is an experiment. Why don't we have an
 experimental hardfork?

I saw your post about that awhile ago, thanks for doing the work!  My
fiddling with that end of the food chain is gated by my needing to block
out a weekend to set up a bitcoind build environment.

How do "big-block" testnet nodes running this 6382 rev recognize each other
on the peer network? If I set up a 2MB block limit testnet node and
-addnode another 2MB block testnet node (say, JornC's node) to it, and my
node mines a block stuffed with 1.3MB of test txs, the other "big-block"
node should accept my mined block, but it will be rejected / immediately
orphaned by the rest of the testnet network because it exceeds their notion
of block size limit, correct?

Thanks,
-Danny
