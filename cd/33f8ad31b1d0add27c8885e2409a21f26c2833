I already explained why this isn't the case: If we're comparing MASF to 
MASF+CBV, then I agree. But MASF is not necessarily always on the table, so 
the comparison where this becomes relevant is MASF+CBV vs UASF.

Versionbits change/lose their meaning after the deployment timeout. For this 
reason, the timeout must be specified so the check is skipped when that 
occurs.

Also, doing it the way you describe would fail to enforce that BIP9 is 
actually in use for the block version; you could simply add that as an 
additional condition, but it seems pretty hacky since you wouldn't be able to 
upgrade versionbits anymore...

Script validity can still be cached with this: you would always allow the 
opcode to succeed at evaluation-time, and simply store the criteria checked 
separately. Then it would behave effectively the same as using the transaction 
version number.
