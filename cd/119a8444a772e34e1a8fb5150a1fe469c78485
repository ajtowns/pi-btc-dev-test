The problem is ?BTC that bit tries to solve. 

BTC, mBTC and ?BTC are just too similiar for enyone else than engineers. The mixed use of them leads to misunderstanding. 
I think adoption would benefit of a single unit with easily remembered and associated name that has no smaller than 1/100 fractions called satoshis.

If most of the wallets start displaying amounts in ?BTC quantities, it will be obvious that a ?BTC is a different magnitude than a BTC.  Nobody is going to look at their 100,000 ?BTC balance and think they have 100,000 BTC. People will immediately make the mental adjustment to the new order of magnitude even if they don't specifically know that ? means micro, or that micro means 1e-6.
