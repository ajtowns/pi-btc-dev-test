This has been discussed many times. But in any case: If you encounter this
as a problem it means you are re-using addresses, which is discouraged for
good reasons.

Otherwise, when someone wants to send you BTC they need to request a new
receiving address from you. Along with this request they can also send a
message, over whatever channel is used to negotiate the payment.

If you're just posting a static bitcoin address somewhere for donations,
consider it an anonymous (wel, pseudonymous) gift jar.
