For each neighbour, a Bitcoin peer keeps the history of addresses that
it forwarded to the neighbour. If an address was already forwarded
to a neighbour it is not retransmitted again.

An attacker can make a list of potential IP addresses of clients (say
an IP range of an ISP, or listen for addresses in the Bitcoin network
before the attack). Then she periodically "spams" the network with this list and
updates the address-forward history at each Bitcoin peer.
After each "spam" round, the attacker reconnects her connections to Bitcoin peers
and thus clears the retransmission history for her connections only.

As the result, when a NAT client connects to the network and advertises its
address, the addresses will propagate to the attacker's connections only.
