The reason it is in fact geek wanking is because pgp tried to solve a problem 
that can't be solved.
It tried to provide distributed trust to a system of identity, while still 
depending on the local governments (i.e. centralization) for the upstream ID.

Its a marriage that has no benefits.

What we really want is a (decentralized) identity management that allows me to 
create a new anonymous ID and use that as something more secure when needed 
that I have to proof its me.

So for instance I start including a bitcoin public key in my email signature. 
I don't sign the emails or anything like that, just to establish that everyone 
has my public key many times in their email archives.
Then when I need to proof its me, I can provide a signature on the content 
that the requester wants me to sign.

All the overhead of PGP and the WoT is really completely unneeded and just 
means that less people use it.

Consider this; people create accounts on GitHub or Reddit and those have in 
fact more value than your pgp key!  Because they got the anonymous part right.
