You should compare this to having set up a node on a completely clean
computer.  It would also help to know what operating system(s) you are
using for both the oldie and the freshie.

Also, dump your XT, is poo.  Then try again, look at Core nodes on
your oldie and freshie.  Watch them for a bit.

Cheers,
