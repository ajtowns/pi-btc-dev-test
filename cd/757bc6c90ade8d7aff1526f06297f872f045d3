Hi ZmnSCPxj,

Few thoughts about your proposal:
1- I kinda like the idea and I would probably use it, but still I believe
it is a very limited use case and probably most wallet providers will not
be interested in supporting it.
2- Early adopters and people highly involved in the community may
appreciate the "hodl" part in the redemption code, but it could cause
confusion in normal users not understanding the reference.

Regarding the time-zone I think the best option is to stick the UTC
standard, using UTC+14 could be confusing since it is very unusual  and we
are not used to deal with it.

> The below are expected use cases of this proposal:

> # A user wants to purchase an amount of Bitcoin,

> The user fears that he or she may have "weak hands",
> i.e. sell unfavorably on a temporary dip, and thus
> commits the coins into a timelocked fund that can
> only be opened after a specific date.
> # A user wants to gift an amount of Bitcoins to
> an infant or minor, and wants the fund to not be spent
> on ill-advised purchases until the infant or minor
> reaches the age of maturity.
> # A user may wish to prepare some kind of monthly subsidy
