The seccomp mechanism would work well here - it's a syscall whitelister,
which makes ptrace useless, among other things. Used by Chrome as of v23
to sandbox the renderers.

We'd probably need to use it with chroot and whitelist the open() call
so that the existing code can create new blockfiles and do whatever
leveldb does.
