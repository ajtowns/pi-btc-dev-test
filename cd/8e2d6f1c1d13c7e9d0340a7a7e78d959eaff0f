I really like the concept of Bitcoin Authenticator and think it?s exactly what I was describing (without a third-party).

I think it?s a bit confusing when they describe Bitcoin Authenticator as 2FA.  I think it may be more accurate to describe it as out of band transaction verification/signing or dual transaction signing.  Regardless, it?s very exciting to see others are thinking about this too.
