Paul,

There is a difference between replying to an email, and addressing the issues that were brought up in it.

I did read your reply, and I chose not to respond to it because it did not address anything I said.

Here's an example:

Here, you admit that the security of the sidechains allows miners to steal bitcoins, something they cannot do currently.

You next tried to equate three different types of theft, what you called "Classic Theft", "Channel Theft", and "Drivechain Theft", saying:

> I do not think that any of the three stands out as being categorically
> worse than the others

To anyone who understands bitcoin, there is a very clear, unmistakeable difference between double-spending ("Classic Theft"), and *ownership* of the private key controlling the bitcoins.

Similarly, to anyone who understands bitcoin, there is also a very clear, unmistakeable difference between censorship ("Channel Theft"), and *ownership* of the private key controlling the bitcoins.

The entire email was a very long-form way of admitting to all of the issues that were raised in the previous email, while making it sound like you had addressed the issues.

I am not sure how else to respond to that email, given that none of the issues were really addressed.

Drivechain is an unmistakeable weakening of Bitcoin's security guarantees. This you have not denied.

There is no reason to weaken Bitcoin's security in such a dramatic fashion. Better options are being worked on, they just take time.

Kind regards,
Greg Slepak
