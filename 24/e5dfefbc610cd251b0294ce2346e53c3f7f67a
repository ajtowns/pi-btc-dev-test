The two are complementary, not competing. BIP62 prevents *non-signers* from
mutating the transactions, which is very important. The 'Build your own
nHashType' proposal enables chained transactions even in the face of
*signers* mutating the transaction. I believe that integrating both will
lead to the best defense against transaction malleability, and will enable
more complicated uses of chained transactions (such as micropayment
channels).

Best,
Stephen
