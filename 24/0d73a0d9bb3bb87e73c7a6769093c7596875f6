If the phone isn't willing to immediately authorise then it'd have to fall
back to HTTPS or Bluetooth as normal.

I guess only the amount and destination are relevant for risk analysis.

I think IsoDep based protocols must bypass Beam - when I scan my e-passport
there's no beam animation.

Well, for <400msec there can't be any user interaction. But checking
signatures on the payment request and constructing and signing the inputs
can all be done in parallel - you should be able to max out every core, at
least for a brief moment.

Then that subway kind of sucks ;) Have you been to London and used Oyster?
I think the capital wouldn't work at all without the low latency Oyster
cards. The tube would have stopped scaling some time ago.
