That is an implementation issue? mostly one that arises as an indirect
consequence of not having headers first and the parallel fetch, not a
requirements issue.

Under the current bitcoin validity rules it should be completely
reasonable to run a full contributing node with no more than 30 kb/s
inbound (reviving two copies of everything, blocks + tansactions ) and
60 kbit/sec outbound (sending out four copies of everything). (So long
as you're sending out >= what you're taking in you're contributing to
the network's capacity). Throw in a factor of two for bursting, though
not every node needs to be contributing super low latency capacity.

This is absolutely not the case with the current implementation, but
it's not a requirements thing.
