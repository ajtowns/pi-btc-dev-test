DLP (data loss prevention) products usually have MITM capability, to
make sure that proprietary information isn't being exfiltrated.  Also,
some companies have full packet capture policies.  The technology is
out there and people buy and use it.  Whether or not they're going to
care about Bitcoin URIs in the short term, I don't know.

Some of the companies documented here have such products:

You are correct in that the incentive to carry out MITM attacks in
this use case may not be there.  However, detecting transactions may
be more useful to an attacker than meddling with them.
