Every re-implementation, re-factoring even copy-paste introduces a risk of disagreement,
but also open the chance of doing the work better, in the sense of software engineering.

My goal is different. Compatibility with Bitcoin is important as I also want to deal with Bitcoins,
but it is also imperative to be able to create and serve other block chains with other rules and for those
I do not want to carry on the legacy of an antique tool set and a spaghetti style.

Bits of Proof uses scala (akka networking), java (api service), c++ (leveledb and now libconsensus)
and I am eager to integrate secp256k1 (c) as soon as part of consensus. The choices were
made because each piece appears best in what they do.
