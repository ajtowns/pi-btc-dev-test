Er, yes, this is what I meant; I guess I should have been more specific.

So, a paranoid client cannot confirm reciept of coins until it has an 
unstubbed copy of the entire chain.  It can do other things (like send 
coins) using a stubbed chain, but it needs the whole unstubbed chain in 
order to be sure that incoming coins haven't already been spent.

Thanks for confirming this.
