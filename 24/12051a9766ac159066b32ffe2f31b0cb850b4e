That's what's so great about Bitcoin. The blockchain is the same
everywhere.

So if you can connect to private peers in several jurisdictions, chances
are they won't all be lying to you in the exact same way. Which is what
they would need to do to fool you.

If you run your own and can't protect it, they'll just hack your node and
make it lie to you.
