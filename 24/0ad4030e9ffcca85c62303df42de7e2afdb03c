Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Update alert false positives

The alert system filters based on the clients version number.

The ubuntu bitcoin ppa is dynamically linked to openssl unlike the 
binaries available from bitcoin.org

There is no way currently to notify users of 0.9.0 w/ static linking 
without also notify 0.9.0 w/ dynamic linking.
