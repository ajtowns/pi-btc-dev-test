If you had authored this as a pull request rather than making the
change unilaterally I would have recommended leaving it so the
reference client was always first. I also would have suggested that it
use JS randomization instead of jekyll in order to get more even
coverage, though I think thats a more minor point.

Some people were concerned when this page was created that it would
just be a source of useless disputes.  I think its becoming clear that
this is the case. I think the cost of dealing with this page is
starting to exceed the benefit it provides and we should probably
consider removing it.
