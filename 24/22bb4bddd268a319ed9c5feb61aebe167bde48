I wasnt suggesting people add drafts willy nilly to the repository.
When working on a proposal you can work on it in your own fork and create a
PR. When it's ready to be accepted as a working draft by the WG, then it
can be merged into the draft folder. At which point, PRs are made to that
draft copy until it gets into a ready state to become final. If passed,
it's moved to the accepted/ folder.

This way random BIPS cannot be added to the drafts/ folder in the official
repo. They are only added once they are accepted as a working draft
proposal by Gavin or whatever. Now you get all the niceties of github
workflow for collaboration and tweaking of the draft proposal.
