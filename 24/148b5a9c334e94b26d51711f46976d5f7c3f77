My only concern is UTXO pollution. There could be a ?CPFP anchor? softfork that outputs with empty scriptPubKey and 0 value are spendable only in the same block. If not spent immediately, they become invalid and are removed from UTXO. But I still think the best solution is a more flexible SIGHASH system, which doesn?t need CPFP at all.
