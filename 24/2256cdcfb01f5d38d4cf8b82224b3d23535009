True... there are two propagation thresholds... "-minrelaytxfee"
(defaults to 1000 sotoshi/kbyte) and "relaypriority" (defaults to
True).  If -relaypriority is True, then items with a priority above
57600000 (currently <ref1>) will still be relayed, even if their TxFee
is below MinRelayTxFee.

Therefore even if miners are using bitcoind rules for mempool tx
creation, they can still configure how and what they propagate.

The flip-side of this is that a transactions priority will go up the
longer it ages (in the mempool).  So it would be possible (if
relaypriority was on) for even a lowfee transaction to become
relayable eventually simply based on relaypriority

If the recipient is running a full node with incoming connections.
I'm not sure if SPV clients rebroadcast both spend and receive
transactions.
