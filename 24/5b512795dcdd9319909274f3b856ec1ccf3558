So all data push operations? Including or excluding 1-byte constants?

What about the entire output script? (if I want to match just one particular multisig output script)

I'm not sure. As soon as you have 129 transactions in a block (including coinbase), you need 8 path
entries for each included transaction, which requires more bytes than the transaction itself.

When you're including M out of N transactions of a block, you never need more than N-M path entries
in total to reconstruct the merkle root. With the proposed format, it requires M*ceil(log2(N)).

For a 1000-transaction block, when matching ~everything, you need >300 KiB of overhead, while almost
nothing is required.
