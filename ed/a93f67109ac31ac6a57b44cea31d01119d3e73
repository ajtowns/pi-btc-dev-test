Hi-

One concern is that this doesn't seem compatible with Lightning as
currently written.  Most relevant is that non-cooperative channel close
transactions in Lightning use OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, which references the
sequence field of the txin; if the txin doesn't have a sequence number,
OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY can't work.

LockByBlock and LockByTime aren't described and there doesn't seem to be
code for them in the PR (186).  If there's a way to make OP_CLTV and OP_CSV
work with this new format, please let us know, thanks!
