Well, many certs have something in the O field.  That has nothing to
do with EV - EV just mandates a particular set of validation
requirements.

I agree that blindly showing the O field may not be ideal - there
*may* conceivably be some CAs that include it without validation on
their cheap certs (although most cheap certs simply don't include it).
But it's not clear that EV or not is the right criterion here - there
are certainly non-EV certs out there that are organisation validated.

I have really mixed feelings about giving this privileged treatment
exclusively to EV certs, for the simple reason that the rules around
EV certs are iniquitous and some businesses are excluded.

e.g. in the UK sole traders (that is, unincorporated businesses) can't
get EV certs because the UK doesn't maintain a trade register of such
businesses and therefore such businesses are incapable of satisfying
the EV rules.

That said, EV certs are here, now, and (sadly) supporting them is
better than doing nothing...
