Subject: [bitcoin-dev] [BIP Proposal] Buried Deployments
Message-ID: <CAFp6fsGmynRXLCqKAA+iBXObGOZ2h3DVW8k5L9kSfbPmL1Y-QQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Recently Bitcoin Core merged a simplification to the consensus rules
surrounding deployment of BIPs 34, 66, and 65 (
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8391), and though the change is a
minor one, I thought it was worth documenting the rationale in a BIP for
posterity.

Here's the abstract:

Prior soft forks (BIP 34, BIP 65, and BIP 66) were activated via miner
signaling in block version numbers. Now that the chain has long since
passed the blocks at which those consensus rules have triggered, we can (as
a simplification and optimization) replace the trigger mechanism by caching
the block heights at which those consensus rules became enforced.

The full draft can be found here:
