Have we considered just leaving that problem to a different protocol such as
BitTorrent? Offering up a few GB of storage capacity is a nice idea but it
means we would soon have to add structure to the network to allow nodes to find
each other to actually get that data. BitTorrent already has that issue thought
through carefully with it's DHT support.

What are the logistics of either integrating a DHT capable BitTorrent client,
or just calling out to some library? We could still use the Bitcoin network to
bootstrap the BitTorrent DHT.
