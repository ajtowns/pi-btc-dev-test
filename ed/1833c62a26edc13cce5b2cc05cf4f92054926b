Well, miners are all supposed to be more or less equivalent - modulo
differences in tx acceptance policies - so I'd hope that having out of bad
fee mechanisms yet still broadcasting the TX isn't that common. If it was
broadcasted, it should get mined in short order, otherwise things are going
wrong.

submitted to miners directly.
