Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Making AsicBoost irrelevant
Message-ID: <20160510185728.GA1149@fedora-21-dvm>

As part of the hard-fork proposed in the HK agreement(1) we'd like to make the
patented AsicBoost optimisation useless, and hopefully make further similar
optimizations useless as well.

What's the best way to do this? Ideally this would be SPV compatible, but if it
requires changes from SPV clients that's ok too. Also the fix this should be
compatible with existing mining hardware.
