My concern isn't a matter of trustworthyness, it's a matter of too
many eggs in one basket (especially a basket with potentially poor
jurisdictional locality).  The current control of the domain has
proven reasonably trustworthy, and if there is a concern for funding
our own server stuff that can be easily handled (e.g. if need be, I'd
pay for it myself, without being in control of it).

Also, in terms of effective lobbying/advocacy I worry that the
foundation would be unable to do an effective job if its saddled with
the belief that its in control of Bitcoin ("Why don't you just make
every transaction {...}": the answer is because its a decentralized
system and no one can unilaterally change it in ways its users would
hate, but it becomes complicated. It's crisper when its clear that
diverse and independant parties are in control of the popular
infrastructure).
