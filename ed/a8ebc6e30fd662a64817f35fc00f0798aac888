No.

For embargoed fixes we test the specific fixes against experienced
developers inside the project, handing them the proposed commit and
informing them that it fixes a vulnerability and asking them to
identify it.

This does not guarantee that the fix won't leak the issue, but in
virtually all cases in the past the issues we've dealt with would not
be made worse off being leaked in that way vs just making it public
outright.

If we had an issue that would be-- e.g. an RCE that could lead to
private key theft, we would likely handle it differently (e.g. making
a public notice to take sensitive systems offline before attempting
any fix).

History does not support your assumptions.

Not really.  Any forced change still creates centralization,
dependence, and an opportunity for insecurity.

That is a concern too, but our bar for backport fixes is low enough
that they're often able to include more serious fixes without calling
attention to them.

This is true even outside of the consensus critical parts.  In the P2P
network other people upgrading can be protective.

Sure, a few have. Most do not because they are either not focused on
software quality or consider themselves as having an adversarial
relationship with Bitcoin.

If you'd like to provide the sort of valuable information to the
market which may get you sued or targeted for harassment of physical
attack-- feel free. Don't ask the rest of us to do so.
