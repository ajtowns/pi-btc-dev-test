many thanks for the explanation.

so it should be fair to say that BIP 102 + SW would bring a gain between
2*1.6 and 2*2.

Just for the sake of simplicity if we take the middle of the interval we
could say
that BIP102 + SW will bring us a max block (virtual) size equal to 1MB * 2
* 1.8 = 3.6

Is it right?
