Yes, it makes sense. A BIP is something people refer to, either just by
its number or by URL, and with multiple orthogonal "sub-BIPs" it's
difficult to refer to. We have this problem with BIP32 already -- all HD
wallets implement the derivation part of BIP32 but almost none do
implement the hierarchy part (and use BIP43/44 instead). I tried to
split up BIP32 into two BIPs later (without any content changes), but it
was declined because of its final state.

There is no harm in using a BIP only for a small thing, BIP numbers are
infinite.
