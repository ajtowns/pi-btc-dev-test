Good morning karl and Segue,

Specifically for c-lightning, we are not yet rated for pruned bitcoind use, although if you installed and started running bitcoind before installing the lightningd, caught up to the chain, and then installed lightningd and set things up so that bitcoind will get killed if lightningd stops running (so that bitcoind will "never" leave lightningd too far behind).

Officially though pruned bitcoind is not supported for c-lightning, so loss of funds due to doing the above idea is entirely your fault.

On the topic of such a "chapter-based" archiving, it needs to get implemented and reviewed.  As-is I see no reason why it cannot be done, but I think the details are far more important.

1.  How do we select the archive servers?
2.  How can we ensure that no chapter has only a small number of actual owners who could easily coordinate to deny access to historical blockchain data to those they deem undesirable?

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
