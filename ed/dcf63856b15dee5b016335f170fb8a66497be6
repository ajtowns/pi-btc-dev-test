Hello,

Thanks for testing this clarifying things about PGP/MIME and I apologize 
for wasting your time with it. It looks like a SPAM filtering service I 
use is re-writing some parts of some plain text messages with some 
special/alternate encoding characters (not sure what it really is). 
Anyway, if I manually export/import a message from gmane (bypassing my 
e-mail SPAM filter), thunderbird/enigmail is not having problems 
verifying signatures. I guess I never realized this before because all 
other signed messages I normally receive are encrypted and the SPAM 
filter does not mess with non plain text data.
