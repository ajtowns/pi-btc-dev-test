Consensus is arrived when the people who are most active at the time
(active in contributing to discussions, code review, giving opinions etc.)
agreed to ACK. There are a regular staple of active contributors. Bitcoin
development is clearly a meritocracy. The more people participate and
contribute the more weight their opinions hold.

I am not sure that is fair, your PR was reverted because someone found a
huge exploit in your PR enough to invalidate all your arguments used to get
it merged in the first place.

I don't think it's as simple as that. Objections for the sake of
objections, or unsound technical objections are going to be seen for what
they are. This is a project with of some of the brightest people in the
world in this field. Sure people can be disruptive but their reputation
stand the test of time.

The consensus system might not be perfect, but it almost feels like you
want to declare a state of emergency and suspend all the normal review
process for this proposed hard fork.
