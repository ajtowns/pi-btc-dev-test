Not a covenant but interesting nevertheless: _One_ of OP_CAT and
OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY alone is enough to implement "opt-in miner
takes double-spend" [1]:

You can create an output, which is spendable by everybody if you ever
double-spend the output with two different transactions. Then the next
miner will probably take your money (double-spending against your two
or more contradicting transactions again).

If you spend such an output, then the recipient may be willing to
accept a zero-conf transaction, because he knows that you'll lose the
money when you attempt double-spending (unless you are the lucky
miner). See the discussion in [1] for details. 

The implementation using OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY is straight-
forward. You add a case to the script which allows spending if two
valid signatures on different message under the public key of the
output are given.

What is less known I think:
The same functionality can be achieved in a simpler way just using
OP_CAT, because it's possible to turn Bitcoin's ECDSA to an "opt-in
one-time signature scheme". With OP_CAT, you can create an output that
is only spendable using a signature (r,s) with a specific already fixed
first part r=x_coord(kG). Basically, the creator of this output commits
on r (and k) already when creating the output. Now, signing two
different transaction with the same r allows everybody to extract the
secret key from the two signatures.

The drawbacks of the implementation with OP_CAT is that?it's not
possible to make a distinction between legitimate or illegitimate
double-spends (yet to be defined) but just every double-spend is
penalized. Also, it's somewhat hackish and the signer must store k (or
create it deterministically but that's a good idea anyway).
