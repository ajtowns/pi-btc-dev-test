Agreed. For this reason, the scaling BIPs which don't allow for easy gaming
such as BIP101, your proposal or Pieter's are preferable for their
predictability and simplicity. Changing the fundamental rules for Bitcoin
is supposed to be hard - why give this power up to a subsection of the
ecosystem in order to make it easier to change or game?
