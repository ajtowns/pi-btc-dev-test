This change means that they are kicked off the main chain immediately when
the fork activates.

The change is itself a hard fork.  Clients have be updated to get the
benefits.

I don't understand the situation here.  Is the assumption of a group of
miners suddenly switching (for example, they realise that they didn't
intend to support the new rules)?

Ok, so set the bit and then include BIP-GIT-HASH of the canonical BIP on
github in the coinbase?

Since it is a hard fork, the version field could be completely
re-purposed.  Set the bit and add the BIP number as the lower bits in the
version field.  This lets SPV clients check if they know about the hard
fork.

There network protocol could be updated to add getdata support for asking
for a coinbase only merkleblock.  This would allow SPV clients to obtain
the coinbase.

If the rule was that hard forks only take effect 100 blocks after the flag
block, then this problem is eliminated.

Emergency hard forks may still have to take effect immediately though, so
it would have to be a custom not a rule.
