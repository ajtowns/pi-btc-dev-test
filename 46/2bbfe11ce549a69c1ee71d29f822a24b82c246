Yes, I measure mainnet confirmation times on a regular basis.

Before fairly recently, fee-paying transactions never took anywhere close to
this long to be confirmed.

Hard-fork requires a very high level of community buy-in, because it shuts
out older clients who will simply refuse to consider >1MB blocks valid.

Anything approaching that level of change would need some good, hard data
indicating that SatoshiDice was shutting out the majority of other traffic.
Does anyone measure mainnet "normal tx" confirmation times on a regular
basis?  Any other hard data?
