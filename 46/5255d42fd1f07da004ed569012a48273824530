We have no way of preventing this, so ensure it's done in a way that
minimizes harm. For instance, my zookeyv key-value consensus system can
be implemented using transactions with txout pairs of the following
form:

Let H(d) = RIPEMD160(SHA256(d))

txout_k*2  : OP_DUP H(key) OP_EQUALVERIFY
txout_k*2+1: OP_DUP H(value) OP_EQUALVERIFY

With an additional rule to allow for references to previous sacrifices
with txouts of the form:

txout_n: OP_DUP H(txid:vout) OP_EQUALVERIFY

This is perfectly compatible with Gregory Maxwell's address pre-image
fix to data-in-chain storage, and at the same time is completely
unblockable by making such transactions more expensive - the whole point
is to prove you've sacrificed funds.

Yet another reason why increasing the blocksize is madness.
