There's lots of markets where there is no assured quality of service,
and where the bids others are making aren't known. Most financial
markets work that way - there's only ever probabalistic guarantees that
for a given amount of money you'll be able to buy a certain amount of
gold at any given time for instance. Similarly for nearly all
commodities the infrastructure required to mine those commodities has
very little room for short, medium, or even long-term production
increases, so whatever the production supply is at a given time is
pretty much fixed.
