Subject: [bitcoin-dev] RFC for BIP: Derivation scheme for
 P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH based accounts
Message-ID: <5760259B.7040409@mycelium.com>

Hi List,

Following up to the discussion last month ( https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-May/012695.html ), ive prepared a proposal for a BIP here:
	
	https://github.com/DanielWeigl/bips/blob/master/bip-p2sh-accounts.mediawiki


Any comments on it? Does anyone working on a BIP44 compliant wallet implement something different?
If there are no objection, id also like to request a number for it.

Thx,
Daniel
