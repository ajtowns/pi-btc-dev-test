My apologies for the apparent miscommunication earlier. It is of interest
to me that the soft-fork be done which is necessary to put a commitment in
the most efficient spot possible, in part because that commitment could be
used for other data such as the merged mining auxiliary blocks, which are
very sensitive to proof size.

Perhaps we have a different view of how the commitment transaction would be
generated. Just as GBT doesn't create the coinbase, it was my expectation
that it wouldn't generate the commitment transaction either -- but
generation of the commitment would be easy, requiring either the coinbase
txid 100 blocks back, or the commitment txid of the prior transaction (note
this impacts SPV mining). The truncation shouldn't be an issue because the
commitment txn would not be part of the list of transactions selected by
GBT, and in any case the truncation would change the witness data which
changes the commitment.
