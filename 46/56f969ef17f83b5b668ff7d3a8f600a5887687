I don't object to using a trusted server for this if people want that,
but I don't think the reference client should encourage this.

Apart from that, exposing this HTTP-based interface publicly has its
own problems, like security risks and potential DoS risks. If
anything, we should be reducing the attack surface rather than
increase it. IMHO, the only thing that should be exposed in the P2P
protocol, which is inevitable, and already has some DoS protections.

I like this HTTP interface, but it should really only be used for
trusted local applications and debugging.
