Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin 0.4 Release
Message-ID: <1316753826.3062.25.camel@BMThinkPad.lan.bluematt.me>

Gavin tagged 0.4 release today, so here are my gitian builds.
These zips are in gitian-download format which means they can be
automatically downloaded and pgp-verified using the gitian-updater
script (see
https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder/blob/master/share/gitian-updater). Currently they only contain my sig, but if other devs have time to gitian build and re-roll the same zip with other sigs added as well it would make updating via gitian scripts easy and secure :).
