As far as I'm concerned, anything that requires the coins to originate
in the wallet with some special form is a non-starter.  The new SIGHASH
type allows you to sign transactions with any coins already in your
wallet, and imposes no requirements on anyone paying your cold wallet. 
Any such proposals that require origination structure means that 100% of
people paying you need to "be nice" and use this new script type, or
else you *have* to
