Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin mining idea
Message-ID: <CA+9tygJVkaxegAGjpFA_MutU-xChgS5FK4+JKAR=14k0Ctbm8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have an idea for a gamified bitcoin mining app that I'd like to partner
with someone on that is very good with cryptography and knows the bitcoin
code base well. I have received interest in this from some, but I'm looking
for the ideal candidate to work with. If this is of interest, please email
me at nharan81 at gmail.com.

Thanks,
Neil
