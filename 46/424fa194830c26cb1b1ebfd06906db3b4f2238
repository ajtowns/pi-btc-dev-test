Note that I'm already planning on OpenTimestamps having infrastructure for
trusted validity attestations; log scaling proofs alone only prove total work,
not validity. Timestamping has all kinds of very dubious security properties
when done via proof-of-work, due to various ways that miners can get away with
inaccurate block times. In particular, setting a block time backwards is
something that miners can do, particularly with majority hashing power, which
is the exact thing we're trying to prevent in a timestamp proof.

This all makes me dubious about risking further weakening of this already weak
security with compact SPV proofs; we'd need a lot more analysis to understand
what we're risking. Also note that we can ship a known-good
sum-merkle-tree tip hash with the software, which further reduces initial
download bandwidth needed to get the block headers on top of this obviously
safe eliding of redundant hashes.
