Interesting thought to make the privacy/bandwidth trade-off using  
vanitygen and prefix filters.

But doesn't this effectively expand the universe of potential spies from  
'the global attacker' who is watching your SPV queries, to simply 'the  
globe' -- anyone with a copy of the blockchain?

Some stats on UTXO set size:  (slightly stale -- as of block 270733)

    7.4m unspent outputs
    2.2m transactions with unspent outputs
    2.1m unique unspent scriptPubKeys
    Side note: the top 1,000 scriptPubKeys have 10% of all unspent outputs.

Let's say you use an 8-bit prefix (1/256) that would be ~10,000  
transactions in the UTXO you would be monitoring. But if I knew a few  
different days / time-periods you transacted, I could figure out your  
prefix.

Of course, anyone you transact with would know your prefix outright.

Wouldn't this also allow obvious identification of spend versus change  
addresses in a transaction?
