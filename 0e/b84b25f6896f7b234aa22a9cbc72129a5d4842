Hello,

With the recent discussion started today regarding another bluetooth 
communication proposal created by Airbitz, I'd like to bring people's 
attention back to this proposal that saw little discussion last fall. I 
guess I'm not sure why two proposals are being created. Is their some 
advantage of using bluetooth low energy over standard bluetooth (I'm not 
well versed in bluetooth low energy)? This NFC coupled approach seems to 
avoid a lot of issues with identifying the correct payee. You can see 
this proposed scheme demonstrated in action in a POS application in the 
video link below which demonstrates it with my fuel pump and Andreas 
Schildbach's wallet.

There was a small discussion that occurred after my original 
announcement below. If you are new to this e-mail list, you can find an 
archive of those few replies here: 
https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg06354.html

Since this original announcement, a few improvements have been made to 
the proposal:

 1. Improved documentation and explanation of the use cases in
    Schildbach's wallet's wiki
     1. https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/wiki/Payment-Requests
 2. Issue with the payment_url field has resolved by changing to a
    repeated field and requiring the wallet to search for the protocol
    they want to use, rather than expecting it to be a certain element
    number in the list.
     1. https://github.com/AndySchroder/bips/blob/master/tbip-0075.mediawiki


Although there are some interesting use cases of Airbitz's proposal's 
work flow, tapping an NFC radio with a 5 mm range requires much less 
brain power and time than picking the correct name on the app's screen. 
The manual name picking is going to be especially crazy in a very 
congested location. The payer isn't ever going to want to have to try 
and figure out what register or payment terminal they are at for most 
applications I would ever use.

I'd like to see something happen with this technology. I've also noticed 
that micropayment channels have little formality to being established 
practically and it would be awesome if they could be managed over 
bluetooth as well. Maybe more improvements to the payment protocol can 
simultaneously result (and also extended to bluetooth) that embrace the 
establishment of micropayment channels.
