Exactly.

Ideally code review discussions would be PGP signed and have a mechanism
for someone to sign a commit saying they had in fact reviewed it.
Combined with git's per-commit signature mechanism it'd make it possible
to write a git-pull hook that checked that whatever was being pulled had
some sufficient number of signatures from people whose reviews you
trusted. With such a system you could host code review anywhere safely,
or for that matter, use a completely distributed system.

But that's going to be a long way off. In the meantime github is
probably more trustworthy and competent than anything we ran ourselves,
and we should focus on making sure reviewers eyeballs actually look at
the code that ends up in master.
