Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Help wanted: translations
Message-ID: <CABsx9T2eCpxqzbd0PmWJxCDFLHwOix2BOYp+APQGMZYh_O+R4g@mail.gmail.com>

Reposting here from the forums:

Good news: I'm just about to get a Bitcoin-Qt version 0.5 Release
Candidate 1 out, with a much-improved GUI.

Bad news: all the translations for the old wxWidgets Bitcoin are
obsolete, and the process for making translations is different.

Is anybody willing to write new translations?  Here's what you'll need to know:

Three translations already exist: de nl and ru.
Translations are stored in ".ts" files in the src/qt/locale folder
The 'QT Linguist' tool can be used to create translations
... or maybe an online tool like Transifex could/should be used to
crowd-source the work

And is anybody willing to take the job of coordinating translation
efforts, figuring out if Transifex is a good tool to use, and writing
some documentation to make it easy for people to create and submit new
translations?
