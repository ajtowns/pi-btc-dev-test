This would encourage miners to make their own tiny junk transactions
to fill up their blocks, perhaps leaving larger, more space-efficient
transactions in the mempool.

"Good" miners should probably build upon the block with a set of
transactions more similar to what they themselves would include based
on their mempool at the time.  However, miners don't have an incentive
to do so today.  Instead, they may be better off building upon the
block that leaves the most valuable transactions in the mempool,
e.g. a small or empty block, and maybe leave some valuable
transactions in the mempool for the next miner.[1]  This issue could
possibly be addressed by a soft-fork that requires miners to pay a
portion of their fees to future miners.
