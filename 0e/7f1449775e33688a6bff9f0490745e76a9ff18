I don't really care the exact location it's put in. I just thought there
wasn't an explicit need to put it in the header (via a bit of nVersion),
and the scriptSig is already used for many things (block height, merged
mining hash, "\"P2SH\"", miner identifier). And voting to keep the block
size the same by not voting is fine by me.

Yeah, that was the conclusion we came to chatting on #bitcoin-wizards the
other day. I now think that this could be useful to dynamically increase a
lower limit, but that there should still be a hard upper limit like 20 MB.
I think that just changing the upper limit might be simpler and better,
though.
