As I understand it, you can scan sequentially starting with the genesis
block (or with a block at around the time when BIP44 was written).  Then
if you find a new transaction, which requires to generate new addresses,
you generate them and scan further from that point on.  This way you can
scan in a single pass if the scanning process calls you back when it
finds a transaction and allows you to change the set of addresses on the
fly.
