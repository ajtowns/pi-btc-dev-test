After gathering some feedbacks I substantially revised the proposal. This version focus on improving security, and reduces the number of optional features.

Formatted BIP and sample code at:
https://github.com/jl2012/bips/blob/sighash2/bip-sighash2.mediawiki
https://github.com/jl2012/bitcoin/commits/sighash2

The major new features compared with BIP143:

1. If signing all inputs, also sign all input value. BIP143 signature only covers the value of the same input. In some cases this may not be adequate for hardware wallet to determine the right amount of fees. Signing all input values will secure any possible case.
2. Sign both scriptCode and previous scriptPubKey. In the original bitcoin design, previous scriptPubKey is signed as the scriptCode. However, this is not the case with P2SH and segwit. Explicitly committing to the scriptPubKey allows hardware wallet to confirm what it is actually signing (e.g. P2SH-segwit vs. Native-segwit).
3. SIGHASH2_NOINPUT: basically same as BIP118, but the signature commits to both scriptCode and scriptPubKey. This prevents signature replay if the same public key is used in different scripts.
4. SIGHASH2_MATCHOUTPUT (previously SIGHASH_SINGLE) disallows out-of-range case.
5. SIGHASH2_LASTOUTPUT: signs only the highest index output.
6. SIGHASH2_DUALOUTPUT: signs the matched output and the highest index output. Described by gmaxwell at https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-July/016188.html <https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-July/016188.html>
7. Signing the amount of fees (optional, yes by default). In case of not signing all inputs or outputs, users may still want to commit to a specific fee amount.
8. Signing the witness size (optional, yes by default). While segwit fixed txid malleability, it is not a fix of script malleability. It may cause some trouble if an attacker could bloat the witness and reduce the fee priority of a transaction. Although the witness size is not malleable for most simple scripts, this is not guaranteed for more complex ones. Such kind of size malleability could be avoided if signatures commit to the size of witness.

Any suggestions are welcomed. But I have the following questions:

1. Should NOINPUT commit to scriptCode and/or scriptPubKey? I think it should, because that helps avoid signature replay in some cases, and also lets hardware wallets know what they are signing. I am asking this because BIP118 proposes the opposite. I want to make sure I?m not missing something here.
2. Do we want to add LASTOUTPUT and DUALOUTPUT? Suggested by gmaxwell, an example use case is kickstarter, where individual supporters send money to the last output for a kickstarter project, and send change to the matched output. However, I doubt if this would be actually used this way, because the kickstarter organiser could always take the money before the target is met, by making up the difference with his own input. This is an inherent problem for any anonymous kickstarter scheme. If these new SIGHASHs are not useful in other applications, I am not sure if we should add them.
3. Instead of these restrictive MATCH/LAST/DUALOUTPUT, do we want a fully flexible way to sign a subset of outputs? The indexes of signed outputs are put at the end of the signature, and the signature won?t commit to these index values. Therefore, a third party could collect all transactions of this kind and merge them into one transaction. To limit the sighash cost, number of signed outputs might not be more than 2 or 3. Some potential problems: a) code complexity; b) 1-byte or 2-byte index: 1-byte will limit the number of outputs to 256. 2-byte will use more space even for smaller txs; c) highly variable signature size makes witness size estimation more difficult
4. Should we sign the exact witness size (as proposed), or an upper size limit? Signing an upper limit will take up more space, as the limit has to be explicitly shown in the witness. The overhead could be avoided by showing the limit only if the actual witness size is not equal to the committed limit. However, I tend to keep it simple and sign the exact value. If in a multi-sig setup some signers are unable to accurately estimate the witness size, they should leave this responsibility to the last signer who should know the exact size.

The most notable ones are Taproot and Graftroot proposed by Maxwell. It seems the most logical way is to implement MAST and other new script functions inside Taproot and/or Graftroot. Therefore, I substantially simplified my earlier proposal on SIGHASH2. It is a superset of the existing SIGHASH and the BIP118 SIGHASH_NOINPUT, with further flexibility but not being too complicated. It also fixes some minor problems that we found in the late stage of BIP143 review. For example, the theoretical (but not statistical) possibility of having same SignatureHash() results for a legacy and a witness transaction. This is fixed by padding a constant at the end of the message so collision would not be possible.

> 	? NOSCRIPTCODE: It would be very rare if one could make a signature without knowing what the script is (at least they know the public key). The only scenario that a NOSCRIPTCODE is really needed is the public key being reused in different scripts, and the user wants to use a single signature to cover all these scripts.
