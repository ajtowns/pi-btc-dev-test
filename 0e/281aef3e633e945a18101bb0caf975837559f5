"Support" for a TPM is a rather tricky thing.

By itself the TPM is independent of any CPU. However, it's also not very
useful (though for Pond's use case, it works).

The TPM gets much more useful when it's integrated with features on the
motherboard, BIOS, CPU, northbridge, IOMMU etc. Then you have a full blown
TCG-compliant TC environment, which is useful for many things. Actually it
was never very useful for DRM - that was only one theoretical possibility
that was never implemented and even if it had been, TC is to DRM much as
cryptography is to DRM. So the FUD was just that: fear, uncertainty and
doubt which probably crippled a highly useful cryptographic security tool
for good. One of the more shameful periods of the tech industries history,
if you ask me.
