I agree on getting the bloom filtering stuff in for 0.8, though I
don't think it'll need any marketing at all? ultraprune speaks for
itself. :P
I'm also concerned about overselling it for miners and merchants when
the ultraprune stuff is such a major change.

Since the current changes will just need a lot of testing and soaking
time which is pretty much independent of RPC and GUI changes it might
be unfortunate to feature freeze those things and then have a long
delay just on QA for the other stuff.  I do think we need to talk
about what we think we need to o to get what we have now ready for
release.
