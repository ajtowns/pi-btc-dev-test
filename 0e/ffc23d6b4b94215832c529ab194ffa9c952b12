The statistics come from the aggregate actions of all nodes, especially 
those miners who watch p2p transactions and assemble blocks.

Any one node makes deterministic decisions based on its own observation 
-- just like today's valid/invalid decision based on whether a blocktime 
is within the next 2 hours or not.

The idea is that miners will exclude respends because they put the block 
at risk of being forked off, with no offsetting payback.  The design 
point is to make sure this is sufficiently unlikely to happen 
accidentally, or via some attack vector.
