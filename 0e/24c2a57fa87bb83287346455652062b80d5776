Title: Address Paste Improvement

Abstract. End-users often copy-paste addresses. This BIP aims to facilitate
the user experience regarding this process.

Motivation. Some services already implemented autopaste functions, which is
done as follows: the user clicks to the address box and a Bitcoin address
automatically gets pasted from the clipboard. Depending on the
implementation, this could be either annoying or not permissive enough if
it completely replaces the possibility of manually entering a Bitcoin
address.

The BIP Proposal can be found here:

An implementation will soon follow in Wasabi Wallet.
