Moral,

Mining the sync flag isn't compatible with the payout structure of non
hot-wallet pools like Eligius or decentralized pools like p2pool.
Those need the ability to split a reward among multiple parties.
Instead of giving an address to send the funds to, you could include
the hash of the transaction allowed to spend the sync flag output.
You'd have to zero the previous outpoint of the transaction before
hashing, since you don't know what the hash of the coinbase ten blocks
from now will be.
