Fees are per byte of tx data; call it allowfeeperkb, and given that fees
are required - the merchant would really rather not waste up to about
twice as much on fees for a child-pays-for-parent - it should be called
requirefeeperkb.

Back to your point, the merchant wants to limit total fees that have
been deducted - 'allowfee' is still a good idea - but only in
conjunction with specifying fee-per-kb requirements.

UI once both are implemented is to not show anything in the default
case, and explain to the user why they have to pay extra in the unusual
case where they are spending a whole bunch of dust.
