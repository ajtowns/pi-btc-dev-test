I agree that there is a fundamental incompatibility in usage between
wallets and nodes. Wallets need to be online as little as possible, nodes
need to online as much as possible.

However, a full node background process could also be running if the wallet
is not open itself. Ffor example - by running as a system service.

Bitcoin Core's own wallet is also moving to SPV, so this means a general
solution is needed to get people to run a node when the wallet is not
running.

Maybe the node shouldn't be controlled from the wallet at all, it could be
a 'node control' user interface on its own (this is what -disablewallet
does currently). In this case, there is no need for packaging it with a
wallet The only drawback would be that initially, people wouldn't know why
or when to install this, hence my suggestion to pack it with wallets...
