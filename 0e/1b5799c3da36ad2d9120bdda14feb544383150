This won?t solve the problem. Think about the following conversation:

Alice (not upgraded): Please pay 1 BTC to my address 1ALicExyz
Bob (upgraded): ok, paid, please check

10 minutes later

Alice: received and confirmed, thanks!

5 minutes later:

Carol (not upgraded): Please pay 0.5BTC to my address 3CaroLXXX
Alice: paid, please check

1 hour later:

Carol: it?s not confirmed. Have you paid enough fees?
Alice: ok, I?ll RBF/CPFP it

2 hours later:

Carol: it?s still not confirmed.
Alice: I have already paid double fees. Maybe the network is congested and I need to pay more?..

Repeat until the lock up period ends.

So this so-called ?softfork? actually made non-upgraded wallet totally unusable. If failed to meet the very important requirement of a softfork: backward compatibility

This is also unacceptable.

When someone says "Please pay 1 BTC to my address 1ALicExyz?, no one anticipates being paid by a coinbase output. Some exchanges like btc-e explicitly reject coinbase payment.

Such deterioration in user experience is unacceptable. It basically forces everyone to upgrade, i.e. a hardfork with soft fork?s skin

As I explained above, no legacy wallet would anticipate a lock up. If you want to make a softfork, all burden of incompatibility must be taken by the upgraded system. Only allow exit to a new address guarantees that only upgraded wallet will see the locked-up tx:

I think it?s unacceptable if malleability is not fixed in main chain, for 3 reasons: 

1. a solution is *already* available and tested for > 1 year.

2. the deactivation design (which I think is an interesting idea) makes the ext block unsuitable for long-term storage of value.

3. LN over main chain allows instant exchange of main coin and xcoin without going through the ugly 2-way-peg process.
