Thanks Chris.

Yep, looks like an honest-ish user managed to accidentally get one tx into
one chain and another into the other.

I think I'd cautiously say that if OKPay gets their cash back, or freezes
his balance nobody is out BTC for last night, (instead just time and
effort).

I'm doing a little FUD-fighting right now, but will try and pick up a bit
more if necessary tonight after my flight lands. I think this is mostly
over the heads of a lot of our typical media contacts, though.

Peter
