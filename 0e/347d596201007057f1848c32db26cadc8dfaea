No retries. If there's a timeout the wallet will consider the payment not
made, and if the merchant broadcasts anyway, the wallet will see the
transactions and sync with them correctly. The ACK is not particularly
important in the current design, so that's no big deal.

If we see this situation crop up routinely we can take measures to improve
things. I doubt we will.
