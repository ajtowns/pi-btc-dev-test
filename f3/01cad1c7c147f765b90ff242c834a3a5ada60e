Encryption is useless here. We want everyone to be able to download Bitcoin 
clients. Binaries on sourceforge are signed by multiple parties using gitian.

So long as someone has root (or a user that can modify it), the website is 
centralised. To really solve this, we would need a dedicated server that 
accepts commands only when signed by N-of-M parties, inside a cage locked by 
padlocks with keys held by independent parties, with a SSL certificate issued 
by an authority that has multiple parties watch it every step of the way into 
that server.
