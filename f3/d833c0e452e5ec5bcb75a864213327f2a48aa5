The block size isn?t about scaling but about supply and demand of finite resources. As demand for block space increases, we can address it either by increasing computational resources (block size) or by increasing fees. But to do the former we need a way to offset the increase in cost by making sure that those who contribute said resources have incentive to do so.?

I should also point out, improvements in hardware and network infrastructure can also reduce costs?and we could very well have a model where resource requirements can be increased as technology improves. However, currently, the computational cost of validation is clearly growing far more quickly than the cost of computational resources is going down. There are 7,000,000,000 people in the world. Payment networks in the developed world already regularly handle thousands of transactions a second. Even with highly optimized block propagation, pruning, and signature validation, we?re still many orders shy of being able to satisfy demand. To achieve mainstream adoption, we?ll have to pass through a period of quasi-exponential growth in userbase (until the market saturates?or until the network resources run out). Unless we?re able to achieve a validation complexity of O(polylog n) or better, it?s not a matter of having a negative attitude about the prospects?it?s just math. Whether we have 2MB or 20MB or 100MB blocks (even assuming the above mentioned optimizations and that the computational resources exist and are willing to handle it) we will not be able to satisfy demand if we insist on requiring global validation for all transactions.
