It isn't a commitment in any sense, nor does it make it smoother, because for 
a hardfork to be successful, it is the *economy* that must switch entirely. 
The miners are unimportant.

Devs have even less of a choice in the matter. What is relevant is the 
economy: who do people want to spend their bitcoins with? There is no 
programmatic way to determine this, especially not in advance, so the best we 
can do is a flag day that gets called off if there isn't clear consensus.
