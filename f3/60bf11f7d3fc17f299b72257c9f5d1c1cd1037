you cannot specifically NOT support addrss reuse. on a blockchain where people can send you funds without your permission required to send you funds. so ALWAYS expect multiple payments to the same address

I don't agree. Address reuse is undefined behaviour. Nobody should assume it
is safe or works.

I intend to possibly use SIGHASH_NOINPUT for ordinary Bitcoin transactions in
a wallet I am writing, which explicitly does not support address reuse.
