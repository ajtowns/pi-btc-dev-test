I generally agree with ZmnSCPxj that
good ideas => good devs => hodlers => price => mining

Except that each step is not an absolute, and can be biased by things
like miners who seek profit via fees and other means that are not good
for everyone else. Llansky's belief itself influences price away from
the ideal. Marketing "easy profits for hodlers!" and first-to-market
monopoly are other elements that influence price and thereby guide
mining away from good ideas (like a constant value currency). Then
price pulls in good devs that pulls in more mining. So it can snowball
into a monster.

We need not debate cause and effect since it's distant from the list's
goals. The relevance to me is that the biases away from ZmnSCPxj's
ideal are a reason a more responsive difficulty is needed.

Mining is for determining truth of the blockchain, not to make sure
there is only 1 blockchain. ZmnSCPxj indicates we should not do
anything that has more precision or speed in determining the correct
difficulty if it reduces Bitcoin's ability to be a monopoly. Not
coincidentally, the monopoly helps ensure hodlers become the new 1%. A
fork clone that uses the faster difficulty would attack BTC's slow
difficulty if it achieves a comparable price. All other things being
equal, it would lower BTC's value until it forks to fix the
difficulty.
