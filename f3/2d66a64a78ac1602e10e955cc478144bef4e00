Subject: [Bitcoin-development] RFC: Updating dust output definition,
	and default fees
Message-ID: <CA+8xBpdDmxgW=fAN5QxrpVJS8xUxw_5-Zv4z+4qNcLpLQ8d9=w@mail.gmail.com>

1) Create COIN_DUST constant, to represent the dust spam limit used.

2) Decrease COIN_DUST to 0.001 BTC

Rationale: With the increase in bitcoin value (US$13.67 as of this
writing), it seems reasonable to reduce the value level of which we
consider "dust spam."

3) Update TX miner and relay fee defaults to 0.001 / 0.0005 BTC respectively

Rationale: Reflects growth of dust spam in unspent transaction output dataset.

Review of impact:
a) Definition of COIN_DUST reduced from 0.01 to 0.001.
b) Miners who mine with this code will require a fee >= 0.001 to
include TX's with outputs <= COIN_DUST
c) Normal clients will require a fee >= 0.0005 to relay TX's with
outputs <= COIN_DUST
