I had Matt's answer already, see below, but then I recognized that the group was not cc:-d, so I repeat:

It would help on the user interface to include into individual shares:

1. Number of shares needed
2. A few bytes fingerprint of the secret so shares that likely belong together can be identified.

I wonder how others weight security vs. usability in these questions.

I intentionally omitted that information because it's a security risk. If an adversary gains control of one share and can see exactly how many more shares he needs, he may be able to plan a better attack. If he is clueless about how many shares he needs, then he may not be able to execute an attack at all because he may not know whether his information about what shares exist and where is complete.
