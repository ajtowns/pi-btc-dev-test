This is true. To rephrase, imagine I gave you an ECC public key <ed_pub>,
you gave me back a public key <odinn_pub> of your own devising, then I paid
some money to the address resulting from add_pubkeys(<ed_pub>,<odinn_pub>)
[1]. Can anyone either:

a) Think of a way that Odinn could make an <odinn_pub> such that they could
spend the resulting money without having <ed_priv>.
b) Opine, somewhat knowledgeably, that this probably wouldn't be an easy
thing to do, and they wouldn't be alarmed to see people running software
that did this kind of thing.
