One of the first things to explore is if its possible to dispatch
different isodep applications to different apps. I know you can add an
intent filter matching action=android.nfc.action.TECH_DISCOVERED and a
custom "tech filter" android.nfc.tech.IsoDep. However, as long as there
is no mime type or similar concept, apps will always fight for access to
IsoDep endpoints. We will want to avoid that situation.
