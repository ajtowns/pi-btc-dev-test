Doesn't most mining hardware at the ASCI level start with a SHA256 midstate
given that the nonce is at the end?  Adding further information to the block
should be possible at the beginning of the block without major changes to the
mining hardware.

I feel somewhat uncomfortable about the "after-the-fact" auditing possible in
this scenario. Besides the timestamping provided by the block headers appears
to be useful in some payment protocols, not to mention in general.
