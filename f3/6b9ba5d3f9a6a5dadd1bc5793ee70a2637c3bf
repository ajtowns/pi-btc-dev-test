It's my opinion that the purpose of this list and bitcoin protocol
development in general is to build the base functionality that other
companies and individuals require to provide usability to the end-user. The
0-conf debate is a UX issue. If end users shouldn't rely on 0-conf, it is
up to wallet developers to hide 0-conf transactions or mark them
appropriately. Instead of using this list to debate what wallet designers
should or shouldn't do, we should just provide the tools and "let the
market sort it out". If wallet developers start getting inundated with
complaints that 0-conf transactions are causing confusion and loss, they
will find a solution. If the tools they require for the solution don't
exist, they will come to this list to request action.

Am I wrong?
