For what it's worth I disagree with Gregory on nearly all these
points, so don't take it as some kind of consensus from the Bitcoin
community ;)

Matts change is reasonable but I think we all agree it has minimal
impact at the moment relative to other things, so something even more
complex than that seems like a non-starter. Bloom filtering is a lot
more important.
