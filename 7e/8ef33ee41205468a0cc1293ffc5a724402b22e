CMake is also very standard, used by many projects, and is available in many
distros.

For debians it's as simple as apt-get install cmake, which is not a big
problem as you need to install the other dependencies (such as boost) as
well to build.

Fedora/redhat also seems to have the package 'cmake'. I don't think there is
any modern distro that doesn't have it as a package.
