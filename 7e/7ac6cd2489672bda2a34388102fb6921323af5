The SIGHASH_WITHINPUTVALUE proposal is a hardfork, but otherwise
non-intrusive, doesn't change any TxOut scripts, doesn't change any
tx/block parsing (besides verification), it works with all existing
coins in the network, and existing software doesn't have to use it if
they don't want to upgrade their signers.   The proposal simply provides
a way to optionally sign the input values with the TxOut scripts.  In
other words a signature right now says "I sign this transaction using
these inputs, whatever value they are."  With this SIGHASH type, the
signature says "I sign this transaction assuming that input 0 is X BTC,
input 1 is Y BTC,....".  If the online computer providing the data to be
signed lies about the value of any input, the resulting signature will
be invalid.

Unfortunately, it seems that there was no soft-fork way to achieve this
benefit, at least not one that had favorable properties.  Most of the
soft-fork variations of it required the coins being spent to have been
originated in a special way.  In other words, it would only work if the
coins had entered the wallet with some special, modified TxOut script. 
So it wouldn't work with existing coins, and would require senders to
update their software to reshape the way they send transactions to be
compatible with our goals.

I *strongly* encourage this to be considered for inclusion at some
point.  Not only does it simplify HW as Marek suggested, it increases
the options for online-offline communication channels, which is also a
win for security.  Right now, QR codes don't work because of the
possibility of having to transfer megabytes over the channel, and no way
to for the signer to control that size.  With this change, it's possible
for the signer to control the size of each chunk of data to guarantee it
fits in, say, a QR code (even if it means breaking it up into a couple
smaller transactions).
