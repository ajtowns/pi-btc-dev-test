Nothing really. If it's controversial in any way, I'm fine with
changing that. It's just one those things that nobody needs, nobody
uses, has never been standard, and shouldn't have been possible in the
first place IMHO. Given that, it's easier to just make it a consensus
rule.

I'm not comfortable with dropping OpenSSL-based signature parsing
until we have well-defined rules about which encodings are valid. At
this point I'm not even convinced we *know* about all possible ways to
modify signature encodings without invalidating them.

But perhaps we should investigate how many non-DER signatures still
make it into blocks first...
