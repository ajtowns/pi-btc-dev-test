Darn good question. If the protection fails, would it be better for it
to 'fail hard', leaving people complaining "bitcoin won't stay
connected!"

Or fail soft, so you at least have a couple of connections.

I think fail hard is better-- we'll immediately know about the
problem, and can fix it.  Fail soft makes me nervous because  I think
that would make it more likely a bug splits the network (and,
therefore, the blockchain).

If I think you're trying to DoS me, why would I be nice to you?  I
think response messages would just give an attacker another potential
attack vector, and it is clear from the debug.log what triggers a ban.

Good question. Anybody see a reason not to?  How much tolerance (if
any) should there be for sending garbage data (I assume the
lower-level network stack almost never garbles data, is that a good
assumption)?
