Hi Mike,

The issue with the current parser is that those fields are conditionally optional on that there will be no subsequent fields added.
If there will be further fields they will become manadory. 
 
Why not bump the version and parse the fields as mandatory from then on? This would be backward compatible and cleaner
going forward.
