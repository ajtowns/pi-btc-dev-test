Also, as a few people have pointed out to me, the BIP proposal has no
information at all about testing, reproducable or not.

As much of the discussion about the acceptability of this BIP will be
heavily influenced by real world test results we should expect
sufficient information available to understand and reproduce those
tests; the Quality Assurance Test Plan done for BIP16 is a model worth
looking at:
