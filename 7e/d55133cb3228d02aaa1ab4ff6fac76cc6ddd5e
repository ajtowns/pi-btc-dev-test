Certainly.  Though given current P2P network node version
distributions, it is increasing difficult to relay the older version
of transaction, and will only become more so in the future.

It also remains the case that merchants who accept zero confirmation
transactions are likely already aware of the risk level, and make a
business decision.  One can see tiny digital downloads often at zero
confirmation, but rarely a Porsche or house or bitcoin exchange
deposit.
