While I like the idea of possibly requiring more than 50%, you wouldn't
want to have a situation where a minority of uncooperative (or just lazy)
miners don't add their votes and hold up progress. Maybe 2/3 instead of
1/2, though.

The idea of voting with your wallet, while appealing, is technically
infeasible. Miners can fill their blocks with any type of transactions,
including their own specially designed transactions. And any fees from
these transactions can be collected right back into their coinbase
transaction.
