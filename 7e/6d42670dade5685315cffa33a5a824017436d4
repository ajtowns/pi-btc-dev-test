Yeah, shooting down a shooting down, which you've just shot down.  Where will 
it end?

How about:

"This is a good idea, but we don't want to break backward compatibility a 
little piece at a time.  Instead we'd like to collect all such changes into 
one single compatibility breaking release.  Here's the wiki page you should 
update; and here's the git branch you should push changes like this to."

I know the application/protocol version split has been discussed before, but 
please point me to the relevant discussion on: loading the block chain in 
reverse; transaction only requests; checksumming removal; verack removal; 
storing script parameters outside the script; and requesting blocks by 
transaction hash instead of block hash.

If I've missed all of these discussions and their inevitable logically 
indisputable rejection, I apologise.
