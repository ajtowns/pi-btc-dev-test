This got buried in another thread. Putting it out in case anyone has any
insight.

Does anyone have any data on which of the above two viewpoints is actually
correct? Measuring / publishing these effects will go a long way in either
(a) establishing credibility of the 'system design' or (b) trigger a

that, where would be a good place to start, if it is at all possible.
