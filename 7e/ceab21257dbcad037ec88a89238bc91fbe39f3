A stable version is a good idea. This is why I'm still using 0.3.19
(with some modifications): none of the bugfixes after this version help
me much, and I don't need any of the new features. I've also thought
about starting an unofficial stable version with my modifications to
0.3.19 and some backported bugfixes.
