Probably.

How many connections "should" a node use? We faced this decision in
BitCoinJ recently and I asked the patch writer to reduce the number.
It seems pretty arbitrary to me - if you aren't going to relay, a
single connection should be good enough. Yes, it makes sybil easier,
but if you pick the one node randomly enough it might be ok?

Hmm, I don't recall ever enabling it in my router but it's on and the
Bitcoin support works. UPnP is used by all kinds of common programs
like Skype and Xbox Live.
