Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Testing commits
Message-ID: <CAL0fb62WFvqFFDm=jvgG2B2Gyxj_uV_Ex-drjYHMVh08F0YrNQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on the following to create a stable build environment for
testers:

- Build bitcoin 4.0 source in Windows 7
- Create a package of the build dependencies, and upload to SF
- Write up instructions for the build process

x Build bitcoin 4.0 source in Ubuntu 11
- Create a package of the build dependencies, and upload to SF
- Write up instructions for the build process

I am also compiling a list of commits that need to be tested in both
environments. If you can think of any priority commits that need testing,
and/or have a test case for them - please link the pull request in a
response to https://github.com/alexwaters/bitcoin/issues/2

This is not a requirement for pull requests, but will help process the
important/easy ones a lot faster. I would love to discuss other ways of
prioritizing pull requests, but this seems like it can get the job done for
the time-being.
