Someone is going to burn 150BTC to create a backlog of 30-day in 
September. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hgke4/coinwallet_says_bitcoin_stress_test_in_september/ 
However, the money could be spent more wisely by encouraging mining of 
the first few big blocks

Assumptions:
1. OP_CSV and BIP68 are enabled
2. Max tx size remains 1MB

The donor will create a transaction, with an input of 150BTC, and 10 
outputs:
1. 0 BTC to "OP_RETURN <garbage>"
2. 42 BTC to "OP_1 OP_CSV"
3. 21 BTC to "OP_2 OP_CSV"
4. 10.5 BTC to "OP_3 OP_CSV"
5. 5.25 BTC to "OP_4 OP_CSV"
6. 2.625 BTC to "OP_5 OP_CSV"
7. 1.3125 BTC to "OP_6 OP_CSV"
8. 0.65625 BTC to "OP_7 OP_CSV"
9. 0.328125 BTC to "OP_8 OP_CSV"
10. 0.328125 BTC to "OP_9 OP_CSV"

The first output will fill up the size to 1MB.

This tx could not be confirmed by a pre-hardfork miner because the 
coinbase tx will consume some block space. The first big block miner 
will be able to collect 66BTC of fee. The block confirming the first big 
block will collect 42BTC of fee, etc. This will create a long enough 
chain to bootstrap the hardfork.

The amount is chosen to make sure the difference is <25BTC, so miners 
would have less incentive to create a fork instead of confirming other's 
block. However, a miner cartel may launch a 51% attack to collect all 
money. Such incentive may be reduced by adjusting the distribution of 
donation. (Actually, such cartel may be formed anytime, just for 
collecting more block reward)
