Subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 16 status update
Message-ID: <CABsx9T3748C0LiZETf=dRN5z0-izN=wh6vhuUSB+crXCXcuyAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Mining support for BIP 16 is still under 50%, and won't possibly be over
50% by March 1.  Which means we need a new evaluation/switchover date:

Re-evaluate support: March 15'th
Target switchover: April 1

If you're already supporting BIP16, restart bitcoind with the argument:
  -paytoscripthashtime=1333238400

... to delay switchover until April 1.

Hopefully this will be the last delay; Tycho has told me that deepbit will
support BIP16 as soon as he's able to merge and test the changes, which
will put support at well over 55%.
