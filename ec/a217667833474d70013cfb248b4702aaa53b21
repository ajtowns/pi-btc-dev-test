Uh.  It currently costs about 2016*25*$120 = six million dollars to
reduce the difficulty in your isolated fork by a factor of 4.

To reduce it by a factor of 1000 (what would be required to make a
parallel fork that you could maintain in realtime with a single avalon
device) the cost is  sum(2016*25/4^n*120,n,0,ceil(log4(1000))) or
about eight million dollars.

Surely you can think of attacks on Bitcoin which are less expensive
than eight million dollars. :P

Protecting against that? making sure any such attack has to start from
a high difficulty? is, in my opinion, the biggest continued
justification for checkpoints.

They are signed.

No, it doesn't. It has centrally controlled directories that publish
an official Truth of the Network. Someone can isolate you and thus DOS
you, but they can't put you on a fantasy tor network.  But ...
centeralized.

It does, and we also consider decentralization a core value. But even
the tor project would like to decentralize more.
