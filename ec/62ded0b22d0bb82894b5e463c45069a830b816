Exactly -- both block size proponents and block size change conservatives
seem to be glossing over this aspect - much to my dismay.

Choosing the size limit is choosing the size of a scarce resource.  By fiat.

It is wrong to think that a "technical consensus" can choose what is best
here.

The block size limit defines the scope of a resource for which all fee
market actors bid.  That, in turn, defines who is in the fee market and how
they behave, what market choices are made.

It doesn't matter how or why the limit was originally enacted, what Satoshi
meant to do.  What matters, economically, is what is.  What the software
and our $3B economy & market knows and sees today.  (I think some block
size change proponents miss this!)

The solution lies in transitioning this size limit to the free market.  In
the end, the users must choose their desired level of growth,
decentralization, etc.  We cannot rely on some dev's idea of the proper
level of fee, proper level of growth, proper level of decentralization.

And IMO, a "floating limit with training wheels" is better and stronger for
bitcoin's health from a governance, user choice and free market perspective
than simply "hard fork to 2MB, come back again in 6 months."
