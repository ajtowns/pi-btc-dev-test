?????????????????????????????????????????????
The node should decide to follow the protocol upgrade or not. But they can?t just be passive and do nothing. The choice is always provided.

??????????????????????????????????
If they don?t trust the choice of majority miners, they can use some alt coin that don?t including miners? part.

???????????????????? SPY ??????????????????
We should introduce block validation in the code, but how to provide incentive to no-validating SPY miner is another problem.

??????????????????????????????xxx????xxx???????????????
I don?t see them as completely backwards compatible. since I don?t see that is important if we all agree with ?after block height xxx, then xxx?.
?????????????????????
And we can validate from the genesis block till today.

???45% ????????????????????????????????????????
Of cause, there could be false signal from 45% and have conspiracy with some nodes. But that?s the problem we have today, and it don?t get any worse (nor any better).
