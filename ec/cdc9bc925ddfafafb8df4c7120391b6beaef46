There's a high level guide here:

https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#p2p-network

It's not a protocol specification however, more a lay-of-the-land type
description. The protocol is not very complicated however. The wiki page
describes it adequately. It's basically just a framing mechanism with
excessively aggressive checksumming, a version handshake, an inventory
mechanism to cut down on bandwidth usage, the alerts, and that's about it.
