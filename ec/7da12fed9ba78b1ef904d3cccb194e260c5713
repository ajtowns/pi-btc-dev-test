CoinJoin works as a method of both improving fungibility and mixing with
coinbase transactions.

You probably don't need to do anything clever to split a coin though:
if you send a transaction with a standard fee it will get confirmed
in a normal time on the higher hashrate chain, but won't confirm as
quickly on the lower hashrate chain (precisely because transactions are
valid on both chains, but blocks are found more slowly with the lower
hashrate). When it's confirmed on one chain, but not on the other, you
can then "double-spend" on the lower hashrate chain with a higher fee,
to end up with different coins on both chains.

(also, no double-n in untenable)

Cheers,
aj
