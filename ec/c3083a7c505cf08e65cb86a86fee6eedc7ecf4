Likewise, I did too and am also not very tolerant with "trusted" or
"centeralized" things in general.

An authenticated miner announced set of nodes is _far_ from a cure
all, as any attack they stop can be recovered by adding "and dos
attacks the public miner announced nodes" to the attack's
requirements... but we build security with layers.

Bitcoin's security is only improved when we can weave the network
tighter and make partitioning it more difficult.
