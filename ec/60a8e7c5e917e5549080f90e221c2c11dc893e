I love this idea. Lets build a standardized data set to test against using
real data from the network (has anybody done this yet?).

Something like:

Starting network topology:
list of:  nodeid, nodeid, network latency between the two peers

Changes to network topology:
list of:  nodeid, add/remove nodeid, time of change

Transaction broadcasts:
list of :  transaction, node id that first broadcast, time first broadcast

Block broadcasts:
list of :  block, node id that first broadcast, time first broadcast

Proposed transaction/block optimizations could then be measured against
this standard data set.
