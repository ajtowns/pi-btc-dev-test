See the Open Assets protocol specification for technical details on how a
colored coin (of the Open Asset flavor) is represented in a bitcoin

https://github.com/OpenAssets/open-assets-protocol

http://www.CoinPrism.com also has a discussion forum where some colored
coin devs hang out.

http://www.coinprism.info is a blockchain explorer that is colored-coin
aware.
