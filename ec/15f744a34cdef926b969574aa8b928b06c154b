Thanks, James and Joseph, for the feedback,
It has been a fun experiment!

I just want to note that the plausible deniability was not the motive but
just an example use-case, there are perhaps other use-cases that would be
on the user to decide. I think having a mnemonic that is also reversible
could be useful for other reasons - convenience related perhaps.
*Re security:* I am still not convinced entirely that security is reduced
at all because one still has to search through all entropy in the range
of 2^128 to see whether any of those are reversible (unless there is a way
to only search the field of 2^124 that are reversible, which I don't think
is possible because the hash-derived checksum cannot be determined before
hashing, only afterward). Therefore, security should still be 2^128 for a
12-word mnemonic whether it is reversible or not (as one in every 16 people
that already have one (12-word) is reversible, they just might not realize
it, so we can't say those are less secure).

Best regards,
