Whenever a public key is altered in any way it should be
resubmitted/republished, so yes, please do so.

DO NOT PUBLISH YOUR PRIVATE KEY. That is the data used to sign a document.
You only need to publish your PUBLIC KEY or otherwise share it with
recipients of your signed message so that others can verify it as properly
signed or not.
