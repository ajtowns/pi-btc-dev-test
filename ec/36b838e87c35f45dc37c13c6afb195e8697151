To reduce the list noise level, drama level and promote inclusion, my own
personal preference (list admin hat: off, community member hat: on) is for
temporal bans based on temporal circumstances.  Default to
pro-forgiveness.  Also, focus on disruption of the list as a metric, rather
than focusing on a specific personality.

I do think we're at a bit of a point where we're going around in circles.

Given the current reddit hubbub, a bit of a cooling off period is IMO
advisable before taking any further action.
