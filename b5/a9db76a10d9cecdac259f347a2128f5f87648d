We're going to write down BIP describing such structure. If any wallet want
to be BIP XX compatible, then it has chance to. Of course if any wallet
want to use another format, then it cannot call itself BIP XX compatible,
thus nobody will expect that such software will see/recover all keys
generated by BIP XX wallet.

It still doesn't mean that bitcoinj or Electrum cannot share the bare
minimum of BIP XX. Of course if somebody will use Electrum for 2to3
transactions and then move wallet to client which does not offer such
feature, it won't work. But I don't see that as a problem.

If some developers agree on some specific BIP, then it should be cross
compatible.  Of course if somebody implements BIP XX in different way, then
it isn't BIP XX compatible.

Of course, if somebody don't want to generate compatible bip32 paths, no
problem. It will be the same situation as now.
