What's your definition of "allowed" then? Because a miner definitely can
mine only empty blocks and a miner definitely can do overt ASICBoost (using
as little as 1 bit of the version field) right now. I thought you meant
allowed in the sense that if a block is allowed, it is a valid block on the
network. It sounds like you mean something else, perhaps, "a block is
allowed if it doesn't cause harm to the network." I'm not sure how you
quantify that as that seems pretty subjective.
