What you are asking for is TSA style reactive security and unverifiable and
fundamentally untrustable security mechanisms, rejecting proactive security
on the grounds that it is inconvenient.

What you ask to see implemented will trivially fall to a sybil attack. It
isn't securable. It is running on the honor system exclusively. It will be
attacked, it will fail, losses will be had, the attackers will walk away
with embarrassingly large sums.

You want verifiable behavior? Incentives to tell the truth? Incentives to
be consistent? Multisignature notaries (Greenaddress.it), payment channel
based hub-and-spokes (LN,  Stroem), etc... Trusting the P2P network is
futile. You need one accountable party that is actually capable of
enforcing the behavior you ask for, one that can build a reputation over
time - the P2P nodes you wish to hold accountable are on the other hand
powerless to stop an actual attack, their reputations are therefore
meaningless and irrelevant. Multisignature notaries aren't, as they can
stop an attack, and they can be sued for breach of contract if they don't -
neither of those applies to P2P nodes.
