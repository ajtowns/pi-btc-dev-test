Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Blockchain as root CA for payment protocol

I prefer to leverage the signing of the (.) root in the DNS tree. The
amount of effort in signing the root holds more weight than building a CA
off the bitcoin blockchain.

If you want to associate identifiers for payment addresses I suggest
putting those in DNSSEC signed records in the DNS.

For routing around x.509 CAs I suggest participating in the DANE working
group in the IETF.
