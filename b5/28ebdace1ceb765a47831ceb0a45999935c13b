This has never been guaranteed, nor are softforks a "dev action" in the first 
place.

How about we pursue the SegWit softfork, and at the same time* work on a 
hardfork which will simplify the proofs and reduce the kludgeyness of merge-
mining in general? Then, if the hardfork is ready before the softfork, they 
can both go together, but if not, we aren't stuck delaying the improvements of 
SegWit until the hardfork is completed.

* I have been in fact working on such a proposal for a while now, since before 
SegWit.

There isn't an option for "no data", as non-upgraded nodes in a hardfork are 
left completely vulnerable to attacking miners, even much lower hashrate than 
the 51% attack risk. So the alternatives are:
- hardfork: complete loss of all security for the old nodes
- softfork: degraded security for old nodes
