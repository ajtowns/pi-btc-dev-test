People have been sharing the same objections as on this list for months,
I'm not sure what is new here.

I think this is a huge issue. You've been wandering around telling
people that the blocksize will increase soon for months, when there is
very clearly no consensus that it should in the short-term future. The
only answer to this that anyone with a clue should give is "it will
very, very likely be able to support at least 1MB blocks roughly every
10 minutes on average for the next eleven years, and it seems likely
that a block size increase of some form will happen at some point in the
next eleven years", anything else is dishonest.
