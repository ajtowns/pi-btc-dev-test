Why wouldn't an attacker be able to counter-sybil-attack that effort?

Who are these people?

I'll remind everyone that Bitcoin Core does not condone participation in
network attacks to push controversial protcol changes through. I also
checked with Adam Back, who confirmed Blockstream as a company shares
those views.


For those readers unfamiliar with Sybil attacks, basically what the
above does is prevents nodes from being able to finding peers with
accurate information about what blockchains exist - the above can be
used to prevent nodes from learning about the longest chain for
instance, or the existance of substantial support for a minority chain.
This is why we've advocated giving users sufficient time to actively
opt-in to protocol changes.
