Ignoring your contradiction of the political and economical. Your
conception holds under the presupposition that all action of
hash-power is motivated by 'rational' economic interest. Specifically
a very strict distinction between the profitable and the unprofitable;
namely to include transactions based on "business incentive",
presumably on-chain fees.

I am afraid that this conception is a rickety crutch, unfit to
navigate current reality.
