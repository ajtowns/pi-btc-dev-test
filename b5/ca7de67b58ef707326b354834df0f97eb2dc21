Hello,

I've just uploaded Bitcoin Core 0.10.1rc2 executables to:

https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.10.1/test/

The source code can be found in git under the tag 'v0.10.1rc2'

The only change in comparison to rc1 is a fix by Gavin Andresen:

- `1c62e84` Keep mempool consistent during block-reorgs

Thanks to everyone that participated in the gitian build process,

Wladimir
