After getting responses from Deepbit, bitcoin.cz (slush), MtRed, Bitlc
and BTCmine, it looks like march 15 is a reasonable deployment date
for the security update described in BIP 30.

I have created patches for:
* git master: https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/tree/nooverwritetx
* v0.4.0: https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/tree/nooverwritetx_v0.4.0
* v0.3.24: https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/tree/nooverwritetx_v0.3.24
* v0.3.24+vinced:
https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/tree/nooverwritetx_v0.3.24+vinced
* v0.3.19: https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/tree/nooverwritetx_v0.3.19

I've asked pool operators to upgrade, and confirm when they have done
so. If you are a miner or pool operator, and have the ability to
upgrade, please do so as well.

Thanks,
