But it's not *ready* to be used in production. :(

For 1.0, I would expect:

libbitcoinconsensus: an API that makes implementing a full node practical.

Bitcoin Core GUI: reasonably usable safely by non-technical people.

Bitcoin Core Daemon: a reasonably safe wallet (currently blocked by backup-
resistant accounting system)
