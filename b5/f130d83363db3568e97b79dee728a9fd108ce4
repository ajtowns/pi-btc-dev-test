Thanks for the clarification. So I am *always* supposed to reply with an
ack. I was assuming that if I actually send a nack, I would just close
the connection without sending an ack.

Maybe that should be mentioned in the spec explicitly. I must admit that
I think the name of the message is misleading -- PaymentResponse would
make this clearer.
