Subject: [Bitcoin-development] Deprecating "midstate" in getwork?
Message-ID: <4E80D591.2080100@nilsschneider.net>

Hey,

I'd like to simplify the internal reference miner and remove all
dependencies on cryptopp (it's the only place we use cryptopp instead of
OpenSSL).

Unfortunately, cryptopp is also used to calculate getwork "midstate".
This field is redundant and the miner could easily calculate it from the
blockheader so I'd like to remove it.

Any thoughts? Where should such a change should be announced so all
miners can be upgraded?
