Thanks, I'll fix.

Excellent point. That could only happen if activation happened on 11 Jan
2016; instead of complicating the code and spec with another condition, I
think it would be better to specify that the activation date is the later
of the miner supermajority and 11 Jan, with the first big block two weeks
later.
