I see the cause of our disagreement now.

You actually want to share a single BIP32 tree across different
currency types, but do it in a way that guarantees that they never use
the same keys.

I would have expected that different chains would use independent
chains, and have serializations encode which chain they belong to.

Let me offer an alternative suggestion, which is compatible with the
original default BIP32 structure:
* You can use one seed across different chains, but the master nodes
are separate.
* To derive the master node from the seed, the key string "Bitcoin
seed" is replaced by something chain-specific.
* Every encoded node (including master nodes) has a chain-specific
serialization magic.

This is in practice almost the same as your suggestion, except that
the m/cointype' in m/cointype'/account'/change/n is replaced by
different masters. The only disadvantage I see is that you do not have
a way to encode the "super master" that is the parent of all
chain-specific masters. You can - and with the same security
properties - encode the seed, though.
