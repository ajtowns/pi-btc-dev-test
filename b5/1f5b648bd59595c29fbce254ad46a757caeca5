Actually here's something we could possibly do:

Fork off a blockchain that accepts Bitcoin blocks with strictly less 
than max difficulty.  Because it does not accept max-difficulty blocks, 
it is a soft fork.  Additionally, if difficulty of a block is set to 
max, then the difficulty field is extended so that it represents a 
higher max difficulty under a different hashing function, maybe SHA512. 
Because this blockchain also accepts differently-formatted blocks, it is 
also a hard fork.

The idea is that this blockchain is identical to Bitcoin until the 
difficulty goes too high, at which point it diverges.

Transitioning from the current SHA256 to a higher-difficulty hashing 
function could be difficult, since they might be solvable at 
proportionally different hashrates.  In other words, max difficulty for 
SHA256 might be significantly faster than forcing the first 256 bits of 
a SHA512 hash...
