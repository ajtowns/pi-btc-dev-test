Matt,

I started from the premise that I can't remember a bitcoin address but
I can/do remember email addresses which, as an identity are easy
labels for humans to remember. The IPv4 address is the metaphor I
consider. As someone who actually worked on parts of DNSSEC I do
believe in it -- and that it offers reasonable security for
transactions.

Remember MITM attacks on DNS for a transaction are for the sender
against the merchant, and it is only the wallet ID that would be
available. These identifiers are something people use "like" an
identity in that they are frequently shared in public spaces.

Also, a DNS mapping does not prevent or deny anyone from leveraging
HTTP(S) for simular mapping. My point is that DNS is designed for name
to thing mapping and its done a decent job. What I like about the DNS
is that it is frequently leveraged as a proxy for identity and http
URIs are not. Where https://wesson.us/ricks-bitcoin-address doesn't
feel like and identity (to me) and rick.wesson.us does.

My point is about usability and user experience. Bitcoin if used in
the DNS might make DNSSEC more popular which IMHO is a good thing.
